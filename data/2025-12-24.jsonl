Straightforward formulations of both single- and multi-commodity FNC problems based on the Cell Transmission Model are known to be non-convex, mainly due to the congestion effects at diverge junctions. However, recent studies have shown that it is possible to formulate a tight convex relaxation of the single-commodity FNC problem. We extend these results to the multi-commodity FNC problem by considering concave commodity-specific demand functions and concave aggregate supply functions, so that different variable speed limits can be applied to different commodities. Hence, it is possible to efficiently compute the optimal control action to reduce congestion phenomena in the network. We also present a case study of a segment of the freeway network in California, using data from the PeMS database, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Finally, we draw a comparison with a setting where the multi-commodity flows are modeled and controlled as a single-commodity flow, to emphasize the relevance of acting separately on different classes of vehicles."}

When a wind turbine harvests energy from free wind, it produces a turbulent region with reduced energy for downstream turbines. Strategies for increasing the efficiency of wind farms by mitigating wake effects have been the subject of much computational research. To this end, both the positioning of the turbines and their cooperative control must be taken into account. Since they are mutually dependent, increasing attention has been paid to the joint consideration of layout design and control. However, joint modeling approaches lead to large-scale and difficult optimization problems, which lack efficient solution strategies. This paper describes an efficient optimization framework for the joint design and steady-state control of wind turbines under a continuous wake effect model. Through a multi-level reformulation of the joint optimization problem, it shows how problem sub-structure can be efficiently exploited to yield order-of-magnitude reduction in convergence times over naive approaches and prior proposals."}

Hoffmann", "Amine Othmane", "Kathrin Flaßkamp"], "title": "Optimality-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Parametric Optimization Problems", "comment": "Under review, 24 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Many engineering tasks require solving families of nonlinear constrained optimization problems, parametrized in setting-specific variables. This is computationally demanding, particularly, if solutions have to be computed across strongly varying parameter values, e.g., in real-time control or for model-based design. Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method. These results suggest that embedding feasibility and optimality into the network architecture and loss can make learning-based surrogates more accurate, feasible, and data-efficient for parametric optimization."}

However, the success of fact-checking programs like X's Community Notes requires the participation of a critical mass of note-writers who have the time and epistemic resources necessary to write and rate high-quality notes. As X's Community Notes program was first established in English-speaking countries, much academic research has focused on English-language notes or notes writ large. Relatively little research has investigated how different linguistic communities utilise Community Notes. Thus, it is unclear whether Community Notes or similar crowd-sourced fact-checking initiatives represent a viable alternative to social media platforms' partnerships with professional fact-checking organisations across linguistic contexts. This research identifies how different linguistic communities participate in volunteer fact-checking efforts on X's Community Notes program and addresses volunteers' reliance on professional fact-checking resources differs across languages. We find that while the Community Notes program has had strong uptake in some linguistic communities, the program has failed to catch on in others.

We consider generalized Kuramoto models with non-reciprocal adaptive couplings. The non-reciprocity refers to the type of couplings according to Hebbian or anti-Hebbian rules and to different time scales, on which the couplings evolve. The main effect of this specific combination of deterministic dynamics is an induced metastability of anti-phase synchronized clusters of oscillators. Metastable switching is typical for neuronal networks and a characteristic of brain dynamics. We analyze the metatstability as a function of the system parameters, in particular of the size and the network connectivity. The mechanism behind sudden changes in the order parameters are individual oscillators which change their cluster affiliation from time to time, providing ``weak ties\" between clusters of synchronized oscillators. The time series have random features, but derive from deterministic dynamics."}

The purpose of this simulation program is to provide a fast computational workflow and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for small to medium-sized projects. It features a ray-casting algorithm based on a voxel engine. The simulation domain is defined layerwise, whereas the geometry is extruded from a pixel matrix of materials, identified by specific numbers. Input files are a stack of pictures, all other settings, including the configuration of predefined sources, can be adjusted via the GUI. The scattering kernel features the treatment of elastic and inelastic collisions, absorption and absorption-like processes like evaporation. Cross sections, energy distributions and angular distributions are taken from evaluated data bases. In order to simulate boron-lined detectors it also models the charged particle transport following the conversion by computing the energy loss in the boron and its consecutive layer. The electron track is then projected onto a readout unit by longitudinal and transversal diffusion. URANOS is freely available and can be used to simulate the response function of boron-lined or epithermal neutron detectors, small-scale laboratory setups and especially transport studies of cosmic-ray induced environmental neutrons. It offers an easy accessibility and comparably simple interface capable of handling complex geometries. URANOS therefore offers possibilities to understand and simulate the neutron environment at instruments, which would otherwise require extensive modeling and training on dedicated packages."}

In permafrost watersheds of Arctic Alaska, air temperature has warmed by up to 3.5 °C and snowfall has increased by up to ~40 mm from 1981 to 2020. How these changes impact the seasonal to decadal hydrological activity of the carbon-rich aquifers is mostly unknown. Observation-informed thermal hydrology modeling of a hillslope drained by a headwater stream (Imnavait Creek) within continuous permafrost showed profound changes from 1981 to 2020. Warmer summer temperatures deepened annual thaw depths. Steadily warming winter air temperatures, heavier snowfall, and stored energy from summer increased annual water outflow from the hillslope aquifer to the stream, warmed soil temperatures, and expanded and prolonged zero-curtain (stable at 0 °C) zones. In 2017-2018, zero-curtain areas with liquid water persisted through winter.

Designed to leverage quantitative techniques for enhanced risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies in volatile environments, the architecture employs FinBERT, a transformer-based NLP model, to extract sentiment from ESG texts, followed by unsupervised clustering (UMAP/HDBSCAN) to identify 5 latent ESG regimes, validated via PCA. These regimes are mapped to economic conditions using a dense neural network and gradient boosting classifier, achieving 84.04% training and 82.0% validation accuracy. Concurrently, time-series models (SRNN, MLP, LSTM, GRU) forecast daily closing prices, with GRU attaining an R-squared of 0.801 and LSTM delivering 52.78% directional accuracy on intraday data. A strong correlation between S&P SL20 and S&P 500, observed through moving average and volatility trend plots, further bolsters forecasting precision. A rule-based fusion logic merges ESG and time-series outputs for final market signals.

Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \\& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime."}

Our simulator incorporates active moderation mechanisms through two distinct variants: a basic moderator, which implements uniform, non-personalized interventions, and smart moderator, which leverages user-specific psychological profiles based on Dark Triad traits to apply personalized, threshold-driven moderation. By varying parameter configurations, the simulator allows for systematic exploration of how different moderation strategies influence user state transitions over time. Simulation results demonstrate that while generic interventions can curb toxicity under certain conditions, profile-aware moderation proves significantly more effective in limiting both the spread and persistence of toxic behavior. This simulation framework offers a flexible and extensible tool for studying and designing adaptive moderation strategies in complex online social systems."}

Most continuum scale models fail to capture the true nature of thermodynamic property variation across the interface, particularly under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. An improvement over the sharp interface assumption of such continuum scale models is the consideration of a diffused interface and using Kinetic Boundary Conditions (KBCs) to model the mass-transport across the liquid vapor interface. Prior studies on KBCs mainly address monoatomic fluids. Two of the main ingredients required to form KBCs are: density and mass flux. Here, we study a Type-III binary mixture of n-dodecane and nitrogen using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics at near-critical temperatures. Interfacial properties such as thickness, density gradient, and surface tension were analyzed. A key result is the temporal evolution of the evaporation and reflected mass fluxes across the vapor-liquid interface. We observe that both the evaporation and reflection fluxes increase with increasing temperature, indicating enhanced molecular activity and mass transport across the interface at higher Tr. In contrast, the evaporation coefficient alpha_evap decreases from about alpha approximately 0.978 at Tr equals 0.70 to alpha approximately 0.905 at Tr equals 0.95 because the reflected-out flux increases along with the evaporation flux, which reduces the net efficiency of molecular evaporation across the interface. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the very few studies estimating mass transport coefficients for Type-III binary systems, laying the foundation for KBCs in hydrocarbon and nitrogen mixtures."}

This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this \"too big to fail\" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect."}

Deconvolution, on the other hand, is a fundamental and challenging problem in nonparametric statistics with the aim of estimating the distribution of a latent random variable $Z$ based on observations contaminated by some additive noise. The complexity of this task is heavily influenced by the smoothness of the noise distribution and often leads to slow estimation rates. In this paper, we combine the recent unlinked linear regression problem with the classical deconvolution framework. Specifically, we study nonparametric deconvolution under the assumption that $Z$ is a linear function of an observable multidimensional covariate. This structural constraint allows us to introduce a nonparametric estimator of the distribution of $Z$ which achieves the parametric convergence rate in the Wasserstein distance of order 1, and this independently of the smoothness of the noise distribution. Furthermore, and conditionally on an observed response, we consider the problem of estimating the value of the latent linear predictor, whose link to the observed response is not accessible. Through several simulations, we illustrate the fast convergence rate of our deconvolution estimator and the performance of the proposed conditional estimators of the latent predictor in different simulation scenarios."}

Achieving effective and equitable restoration, particularly for coastal wetlands, hinges on spatially explicit socio-ecological information maps that integrate habitats, ecosystem services, human activities, and pressures to guide prioritization, stakeholder negotiation, and adaptive management. This study introduces an innovative multi-layered dataset that bridges science and policy for six emblematic European coastal wetlands. The dataset consolidates ecological mapping (EUNIS 2021 and 2022) human activity and pressure documentation (aligned with EU Habitats Directive, Water Framework Directive, and Marine Strategy Framework Directive) comprehensive ecosystem services mapping (CICES) alongside robust participatory community and stakeholder data. By illustrating practical pathways for participatory engagement, trade-off negotiation, and cross-scale integration, this research equips scientists, policymakers, practitioners, and communities with the scientific foundation to propel the Nature Restoration Regulation and Biodiversity Strategy 2030 objectives, fortifying Europe climate adaptation trajectory.

This review provides an integrated account of spin-glass physics, emphasiz-ing how microscopic ingredients (quenched randomness, frustration, competing exchange interactions, and random fields) conspire to produce macroscopic glassiness. We begin with the canonical Edwards-Anderson and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick formulations to introduce the central theoretical ideas that recur across the literature: extensive degeneracy, metastability, and the emergence of long relaxation times that manifest as aging, memory, and rejuvenation under standard experimental protocols. We then summarize the principal routes used to characterize spin-glass freezing, combining thermodynamic signatures with dynamical probes that reveal the separation of timescales and the sensitivity to thermal and magnetic histories. Building on these foundations, we draw connections across experimental material classes (me-tallic alloys, insulating oxides, and geometrically frustrated systems) by emphasizing how intrinsic ver-sus induced disorder and competing interaction networks shape the observed phenomenology. Recent advances in reentrant and room-temperature spin-glass materials are highlighted as a rapidly developing direction that tests the limits of established paradigms and motivates new materials-driven questions. The review concludes by connecting modern computational developments, including machine-learning phase identification and neural-network analogies, to longstanding challenges in classification, univer-sality, and out-of-equilibrium behavior, and by outlining emerging opportunities at the boundary between classical and quantum spin glasses."}

This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method. The proposed approach provides a unified and physically consistent immersed boundary framework for simulating dynamic interactions between non-equilibrium flows and structural components across a wide range of flow regimes."}

Most sparse generators control at most two of these features, and assortativity is often achieved by degree-preserving rewiring, which obscures the mechanism-parameter link. We introduce CoLaS (copula-seeded local latent-space graphs), a modular latent-variable model that separates marginal specifications from dependence. Each node has a popularity variable governing degree heterogeneity and a latent geometric location governing locality. A low-dimensional copula couples popularity and location, providing an interpretable dependence parameter that tunes degree mixing while leaving the chosen marginals unchanged. Under shrinking-range locality, edges are conditionally independent, the graph remains sparse, and clustering does not vanish. We develop sparse-limit theory for degrees, transitivity, and assortativity. Degrees converge to mixed-Poisson limits and we establish a degree-tail dichotomy: with fixed-range local kernels, degree tails are necessarily light, even under heavy-ailed popularity. To recover power-law degrees without sacrificing sparsity or locality, we propose CoLaS-HT, a minimal tail-inheriting extension in which effective connection ranges grow with popularity. Finally, under an identifiability condition, we provide a consistent one-graph calibration method based on jointly matching transitivity and assortativity."}

Such a device, if detonated, would destroy most of the satellites in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This danger is compounded by the lack of a verification mechanism for the OST.

This study presents a concept and a feasibility study for verifying a satellite's compliance to the OST by observing the neutrons induced by spallation from the $\\sim$GeV protons in the inner Van Allen radiation belts.

Using basic Lyapunov's stability theory and the notion of extended $K_{\\infty}$ functions, we developed a method for determining and enforcing the global asymptotic stability of the single fixed point of the resulting closed-loop (CL) scheme. In contrast with traditional quaternion-based methods, the proposed generalized axis-angle approach enables greater flexibility in the design of the control law, which is of great utility when employed in combination with a switching scheme whose transition state depends on the angular velocity of the controlled rotational system. Through simulation and real-time experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. According to the recorded data, in the execution of high-speed tumble-recovery maneuvers, the new method consistently achieves shorter stabilization times and requires lower control effort relative to those corresponding to the quaternion-based and geometric-control methods used as benchmarks."}

We propose a novel Bayesian two-arm randomized clinical trial design incorporating an interim analysis. At the interim analysis, a new criterion derived from the Hellinger distance is used to quantify the similarity between historical and concurrent control data outcomes. This measure informs both (1) the variance function of the control prior distribution in the final analysis and (2) the sample size reassessment for the second stage of the trial.

How these changes impact the seasonal to decadal hydrological activity of the carbon-rich aquifers is mostly unknown. Observation-informed thermal hydrology modeling of a hillslope drained by a headwater stream (Imnavait Creek) within continuous permafrost showed profound changes from 1981 to 2020. Warmer summer temperatures deepened annual thaw depths. Steadily warming winter air temperatures, heavier snowfall, and stored energy from summer increased annual water outflow from the hillslope aquifer to the stream, warmed soil temperatures, and expanded and prolonged zero-curtain (stable at 0 °C) zones. In 2017-2018, zero-curtain areas with liquid water persisted through winter.

The framework formalizes the traditional geometric construction as a deterministic, reproducible sequence of geometric operations, establishing a clear mapping between measured data, fixed geometric objects, and steady-state operating points. Quantities such as power factor, slip, output power, torque, and efficiency are obtained through explicit geometric relationships on the constructed diagram.

This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this \"too big to fail\" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect."}

Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $Λ$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $β$.\n  We show that the scaled growth rate, $Λ/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f β$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity.

Reframing the issue to focus on the life-saving potential of individual corporate actions empowers companies to act and holds them accountable for inaction. Here, we show the results from an innovative modeling technique which calculates the avoided deaths from sustainability efforts for 3,084 companies spanning a range of sizes and sectors.

However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana \"metal\" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a \"metal to insulator\" transition..."}

In our data-driven framework, we begin by formulating the required conditions for constructing storage functions as a robust convex program (RCP). Given that unknown models of subsystems are integrated into one of the constraints of the RCP, we collect data from trajectories of each unknown subsystem and provide a scenario convex program (SCP) that aligns with the original RCP. We solve the SCP as a linear program and construct a storage function for each subsystem with unknown dynamics. Under some newly developed data-driven compositionality conditions, we then construct a Lyapunov function for the fully unknown interconnected network utilizing storage functions derived from data of individual subsystems. We show that our data-driven {divide and conquer strategy} provides correctness guarantees (as opposed to probabilistic confidence) while significantly mitigating the sample complexity problem existing in data-driven approaches. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed results, we apply our approaches to three different case studies involving interconnected homogeneous (nonlinear) networks with unknown models.

In addition to the massive dimensionality, the data may be characterized by intra-subject correlation, and cure fraction, which are ubiquitous in longitudinal studies with recurrent events defining the endpoint of interest. However, variable selection methods simultaneously adjusting for intra-subject correlation, and cure fraction are rare. We propose a comprehensive variable selection method for frailty mixture cure models based on penalized least squares approximation via the generalized linear mixed model methodology. The method provides shrinkage estimation and selection of fixed effects in the incidence and the latency submodels, adjusting for intra-subject correlation using a random effect term. The random effect is shared between the incidence and the latency, incorporating a flexible choice of covariance structure, allowing intra-subject correlation to be modeled as either time-invariant or time-varying. Estimation is facilitated by a penalized semiparametric restricted maximum likelihood method using an expectation-maximization algorithm. Two penalty functions, namely the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (adaptive lasso), and the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) are studied in the proposed method. Simulation studies are considered, benchmarking the method against an oracle procedure to access its finite sample performance. The practical utility of the method is illustrated using data on recurrent events from a breast cancer gene expression study. In the presence of a relatively large predictor space, results show that the method yields plausible interpretability in whole, as opposed to an unpenalized model."}

Analysis of all 24 permutations in the augmented phase space identifies eighteen distinct invariants ($K_1-K_{18}$) organized into three regularization classes: Class I (permutations $1abc$), Class II ($2abc$), and Class III ($3abc$). Six permutations ($4abc$) yield null results due to Schwarz integrability conditions. Each class is characterized by a distinct polynomial factor that removes singularities at nullcline crossings. The regularized variable $v_n = p\\, u_n$ evolves according to $dv_n/dt = Q_n(x,y,z)$, independent of $v_n$ itself; different conservation laws thereby impose distinct measures of trajectory history. Any three invariants from different classes provide independent constraints, defining a canonical Triad that characterizes orbit structure. Statistical analysis reveals class-dependent dynamical signatures: Class III invariants display higher intermittency (kurtosis ~15 versus ~8 for Class I) and stronger asymmetry (skewness ~2.7 versus ~1.6), correlating with lobe-switching events where the product $xy$ undergoes rapid sign reversal. This geometric sensitivity establishes Class III invariants as probes of topological transitions, while Class I invariants track continuous dynamics. The class-dependent divergence quantifies how different conservation principles impose incompatible demands on trajectory history. High-precision numerical validation confirms conservation of all identified quantities."}

The model is representative of a network of nonlinear strings, where the strings are coupled to elastic bodies. The coupled system converges to the classical string network model with Kirchhoff and continuity transmission conditions as the spring stiffness terms approach infinity and the masses at the nodes vanish. Due to the presence of point masses at the nodes, the boundary conditions become dynamic, and consequently, the corresponding first-order system of quasilinear balance laws exhibits nonlocal boundary conditions. We demonstrate well-posedness in the sense of semi-global classical solutions \\cite{li} (i.e., for arbitrarily large time intervals provided that the initial and boundary data are small enough) and observe extra regularity at the masses as in \\cite{WangLeugeringLi2017,WangLeugeringLi2019}. We prove local and global-local exact boundary controllability of a star-like network when control is active at the endpoints of the string-spring-mass system, except for one clamped end. In this case, at multiple nodes, a complex smoothing pattern appears, leading to asymmetric control spaces when the springs and masses are present. Furthermore, the rank of the Laplacian matrix at the junction is crucial for the controllability property, particularly in models containing wave equations with degeneration at dynamic boundaries, which can be interpreted as damage in mechanical vibration systems where parts of the springs are missing."}

Finally, we combine these estimators with the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method to obtain reliable estimates for linear QoIs and demonstrate their effectiveness across a range of numerical experiments."}

Our goal is two-fold: the first is to preserve the tensor structure when performing dimension reduction, particularly the meaning of the tensor modes, for improved interpretation; the second is to substantially reduce the number of parameters in dimension reduction, thereby achieving model parsimony and enhancing estimation accuracy. Our two tensor dimension reduction methods echo the two commonly used tensor decomposition mechanisms: one is the Tucker decomposition, which reduces a larger tensor to a smaller one; the other is the CP-decomposition, which represents an arbitrary tensor as a sequence of rank-one tensors. We developed the Fisher consistency of our methods at the population level and established their consistency and convergence rates. Both methods are easy to implement numerically: the Tucker-form can be implemented through a sequence of least-squares steps, and the CP-form can be implemented through a sequence of singular value decompositions. We investigated the finite-sample performance of our methods and showed substantial improvement in accuracy over existing methods in simulations and two data applications."}

One promising approach to alleviate this burden is Embedded Index Coding (EIC), which exploits cached data at user nodes to encode transmissions more efficiently. However, most prior work on EIC has focused on minimizing code length in wired, error-free environments-an objective often suboptimal for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where channel conditions and spatial multiplexing gains must be considered. This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems."}

A coarse mesh homogenized ESL model efficiently predicts the global displacement field, from which degrees of freedom (DOFs) along stiffened panel boundaries are extracted. A global to local DOF mapping and reconstruction procedure is developed to recover detailed boundary kinematics for local analysis. The reconstructed DOFs, together with panel geometry and loading, serve as inputs to a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT), a subtype of GNN, which rapidly and accurately predicts the detailed stress and displacement fields for any panel within the hull girder. The HGT is trained using high fidelity 3D panel finite element model with reconstructed boundary conditions, enabling it to generalize across varying panel geometries, loadings, and boundary behaviors. Once trained, the framework requires only the global ESL solution in order to generate detailed local responses, making it highly suitable for optimization. Validation on three box beam case studies demonstrates that the global prediction error is governed by the coarse mesh ESL solution, while the HGT maintains high local accuracy and clearly outperforms conventional ESL based stress estimation method."}

A central result in Bayesian nonparametrics is that under assumptions on the prior, the data-generating distribution (assuming a true frequentist model) and a semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ on the space of regression functions that satisfy the so called testing condition, the posterior contracts around the true distribution with respect to $ρ(.,.)$, and the rate of contraction can be estimated. In the regression setting, the semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ is often taken to be the Hellinger distance or the empirical $L^2$ norm (i.e., the $L^2$ norm with respect to the empirical distribution of the design) in the present regression context. However, extending contraction rates to the ``integrated\" $L^2$ norm usually requires more work, and has previously been done for instance under sufficient smoothness or boundedness assumptions, which may not necessarily hold. In this work we show that, for classes of priors based on random basis expansions or Gaussian processes with RKHS of Sobolev type and in the random design setting, such $L^2$ posterior contraction rates can be obtained under substantially weaker assumptions than those currently used in the literature. Importantly we do not require a known a priori upper bound on its supremum norm or that its smoothness is larger than $d/2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the covariates. Our proof crucially relies on an application of the matrix Bernstein concentration inequality to empirical inner product matrices, which require explicit upper bounds on the basis functions at hand that we prove in several cases of interest. In particular we obtain upper bounds on the supremum norm of Mercer eigenfunctions of several reproducing kernels (including several Matérn kernels) which are of independent interest."}

In our data-driven framework, we begin by formulating the required conditions for constructing storage functions as a robust convex program (RCP). Given that unknown models of subsystems are integrated into one of the constraints of the RCP, we collect data from trajectories of each unknown subsystem and provide a scenario convex program (SCP) that aligns with the original RCP. We solve the SCP as a linear program and construct a storage function for each subsystem with unknown dynamics.

It is shown that conventional convolution quadrature (CQ) methods, which rely directly on the generating function of linear multistep methods, cannot generate completely monotonic sequences beyond first-order accuracy. We rigorously prove that for any linear multistep method of second-or higher-order, the associated generating function $δ(ζ)$ cannot satisfy both that \\(-δ(ζ)\\) is a Pick function and that it is analytic on \\((-\\infty,1)\\) - a key requirement for constructing completely monotonic sequences. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we introduce a reconstruction of the generating function's structure. By strategically incorporating the theory of Pick functions, we successfully construct a second-order completely monotonic sequence. This theoretical advance leads to a discrete scheme that inherits the continuous model's energy decay property, guaranteeing unconditional stability. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence rates and energy dissipation behavior of the proposed method."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Adjusting for (baseline) covariates with working regression models becomes standard practice in the analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCT). When the dimension $p$ of the covariates is large relative to the sample size $n$, specifically $p = o (n)$, adjusting for covariates even in a linear working model by ordinary least squares can yield overly large bias, defeating the purpose of improving efficiency. This issue arises when no structural assumptions are imposed on the outcome model, a scenario that we refer to as the assumption-lean setting. Several new estimators have been proposed to address this issue. However, they focus mainly on simple randomization under the finite-population model, not covering covariate adaptive randomization (CAR) schemes under the superpopulation model. Due to improved covariate balance between treatment groups, CAR is more widely adopted in RCT; and the superpopulation model fits better when subjects are enrolled sequentially or when generalizing to a larger population is of interest. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop procedures in these settings, as the current regulatory guidance provides little concrete direction. In this paper, we fill this gap by demonstrating that an adjusted estimator based on second-order $U$-statistics can almost unbiasedly estimate the average treatment effect and enjoy a guaranteed efficiency gain if $p = o (n)$. In our analysis, we generalize the coupling technique commonly used in the CAR literature to $U$-statistics and also obtain several useful results for analyzing inverse sample Gram matrices by a delicate leave-$m$-out analysis, which may be of independent interest. Both synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior finite-sample performance of our new estimator compared to popular benchmarks."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Adjusting for (baseline) covariates with working regression models becomes standard practice in the analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCT). When the dimension $p$ of the covariates is large relative to the sample size $n$, specifically $p = o (n)$, adjusting for covariates even in a linear working model by ordinary least squares can yield overly large bias, defeating the purpose of improving efficiency. This issue arises when no structural assumptions are imposed on the outcome model, a scenario that we refer to as the assumption-lean setting. Several new estimators have been proposed to address this issue. However, they focus mainly on simple randomization under the finite-population model, not covering covariate adaptive randomization (CAR) schemes under the superpopulation model. Due to improved covariate balance between treatment groups, CAR is more widely adopted in RCT; and the superpopulation model fits better when subjects are enrolled sequentially or when generalizing to a larger population is of interest. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop procedures in these settings, as the current regulatory guidance provides little concrete direction. In this paper, we fill this gap by demonstrating that an adjusted estimator based on second-order $U$-statistics can almost unbiasedly estimate the average treatment effect and enjoy a guaranteed efficiency gain if $p = o (n)$. In our analysis, we generalize the coupling technique commonly used in the CAR literature to $U$-statistics and also obtain several useful results for analyzing inverse sample Gram matrices by a delicate leave-$m$-out analysis, which may be of independent interest. Both synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior finite-sample performance of our new estimator compared to popular benchmarks."}

We find that balancing solar and wind generation with pumped hydro energy storage eliminates the need for fossil gas without incurring a cost penalty. However, many existing long-term electricity system plans are biased to rely on fossil gas due to using temporal aggregation methods that either heavily constrain storage cycling behaviour or lose track of the state-of-charge, failing to consider the potential of low-cost long-duration off-river pumped hydro, and ignoring the broad suite of near-optimal energy transition pathways. We show that a temporal aggregation method based on 'segmentation' (fitted chronology) closely resembles the full-series optimisation, captures long-duration storage behaviour (48- and 160-hour durations), and finds a near-optimal 100% renewable electricity solution. We develop a new electricity system model to rapidly evaluate millions of other near-optimal solutions, stressing the importance of modelling pumped hydro sites with a low energy volume cost (<US$50 per kilowatt-hour), long economic lifetime (~75 years), and low real discount rate akin to other natural monopolies (<=3%). Almost every region of the world has access to sufficient 50 - 5000 gigawatt-hour off-river pumped hydro options that enable them to entirely decarbonise their future electricity systems."}

One promising approach to alleviate this burden is Embedded Index Coding (EIC), which exploits cached data at user nodes to encode transmissions more efficiently. However, most prior work on EIC has focused on minimizing code length in wired, error-free environments-an objective often suboptimal for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where channel conditions and spatial multiplexing gains must be considered. This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems."}

However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations à la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence."}

Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing."}

Each prox-convex step forms a convex subproblem by linearizing only the smooth maps while preserving the existing convex structure.

However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana \"metal\" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a \"metal to insulator\" transition..."}

Unlike conventional NHSEs for dispersive bands that are protected by nontrivial point-gap topology, the flat band remains a point on the complex-energy plane and is therefore always topologically trivial. We found that, intriguingly, the flat-band skin effect (FBSE) is associated with the non-trivial spectral topology of the dispersive bands enclosing the flat band on the complex-energy plane, so it only emerges within a finite range of non-Hermitian parameters and can counterintuitively disappear at large non-Hermiticity. Moreover, the gaps between the flat and the dispersive bands can close at higher-order exceptional points under both periodic and open boundary conditions. The flat-band wavefunctions are discontinuous in quantum distance across these exceptional points, signifying that the gap-closing is singular.

For this purpose, the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution has been broadly used. To estimate the parameters of GEV distribution, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and L-moment estimation (LME) methods have been primarily employed. For a better estimation using the MLE, several studies considered the generalized MLE (penalized likelihood or Bayesian) methods to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information for parameters. However, a generalized LME method for the same purpose has not been developed yet in the literature. We thus propose the generalized method of L-moment estimation (GLME) to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information. The proposed estimation is based on the generalized L-moment distance and a multivariate normal likelihood approximation. Because the L-moment estimator is more efficient and robust for small samples than the MLE, we reasonably expect the advantages of LME to continue to hold for GLME. The proposed method is applied to the stationary and nonstationary GEV models with two novel (data-adaptive) penalty functions to correct the bias of LME. A simulation study indicates that the biases of LME are considerably corrected by the GLME with slight increases in the standard error. Applications to US flood damage data and maximum rainfall at Phliu Agromet in Thailand illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method. This study may promote further work on penalized or Bayesian inferences based on L-moments."}

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles.

Here we focus on the representative PXP model, and unveil the extensive ergotropy scaling of a family of states interpolating between quantum many-body scars and thermal states, the latter of which are known to be passive with vanishing ergotropy. A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario. The ergotropy in a dynamical protocol shows that a reset with a global uniform coherent rotation can inject extractable energy, as a proof of principle way to charge a quantum \"battery\". Our protocol is tailored for near term Rydberg neutral atoms array, while also being feasible for other quantum processors. Our results establish that quantum many-body scars, despite the tiny fraction of the Hilbert space they occupy, can be efficiently exploited for storing extractable energy, and \"scarring\" a many-body system as a promising route for engineering quantum many-body battery."}

To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder.

We find that balancing solar and wind generation with pumped hydro energy storage eliminates the need for fossil gas without incurring a cost penalty. However, many existing long-term electricity system plans are biased to rely on fossil gas due to using temporal aggregation methods that either heavily constrain storage cycling behaviour or lose track of the state-of-charge, failing to consider the potential of low-cost long-duration off-river pumped hydro, and ignoring the broad suite of near-optimal energy transition pathways. We show that a temporal aggregation method based on 'segmentation' (fitted chronology) closely resembles the full-series optimisation, captures long-duration storage behaviour (48- and 160-hour durations), and finds a near-optimal 100% renewable electricity solution. We develop a new electricity system model to rapidly evaluate millions of other near-optimal solutions, stressing the importance of modelling pumped hydro sites with a low energy volume cost (<US$50 per kilowatt-hour), long economic lifetime (~75 years), and low real discount rate akin to other natural monopolies (<=3%).

Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning."}

We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana \"metal\" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a \"metal to insulator\" transition..."}

This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method. The proposed approach provides a unified and physically consistent immersed boundary framework for simulating dynamic interactions between non-equilibrium flows and structural components across a wide range of flow regimes."}

Our two tensor dimension reduction methods echo the two commonly used tensor decomposition mechanisms: one is the Tucker decomposition, which reduces a larger tensor to a smaller one; the other is the CP-decomposition, which represents an arbitrary tensor as a sequence of rank-one tensors. We developed the Fisher consistency of our methods at the population level and established their consistency and convergence rates. Both methods are easy to implement numerically: the Tucker-form can be implemented through a sequence of least-squares steps, and the CP-form can be implemented through a sequence of singular value decompositions. We investigated the finite-sample performance of our methods and showed substantial improvement in accuracy over existing methods in simulations and two data applications."}

In the absence of magnetic field, transport is governed by a single shear viscosity coefficient, whereas the application of a finite magnetic field induces anisotropy, give rise to the five independent shear viscosity coefficients associated with distinct velocity gradient tensors. These coefficient can be physically categorized into perpendicular, parallel and Hall components relative to the magnetic field direction. When the scattering time equals to the cyclotron time, the perpendicular component is suppressed by 80% and parallel component by 50%, and Hall effect can reach maximum. Corresponding magnetic field strength for electron fluid in graphene is around 0.01-0.1 Tesla and the same for non-relativistic electron fluid and ultra-relativistic quark fluid are around 10 Tesla and 10^14 Tesla respectively.

Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \\& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime."}

In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions.

On the one hand, quantum information theory assumes subsystem locality, i.e.~the factorization of the total Hilbert space into subsystems. On the other hand, gauge constraints prevent the total Hilbert space to decompose into a spacetime-local tensor product structure. Because the Hilbert space structure of gauge theories does not accommodate the subsystem decomposition used in quantum information theory, standard information-theoretic results, such as the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theorem, cannot be used straightforwardly in the context of gauge theories. In this work, we bridge this gap in the case of a two-dimensional lattice gauge model that captures key features of electromagnetism. In particular, we construct gauge-invariant local algebras and derive a physically meaningful decomposition of the Hilbert space, providing an operationally consistent notion of locality in the absence of a local tensor-product structure. We apply this framework to field-mediated entanglement protocols relevant to proposed tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We show that the discretized version of electromagnetism satisfies an analogue of the LOCC theorem: entanglement cannot be generated without genuine quantum field interactions, even in the absence of a spacetime-local tensor product factorization of the Hilbert space. This may point towards an operational way to define a subsystem structure for gauge theories."}

Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \\& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime."}

Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning."}

Leveraging autonomous error correction, we propose a second-generation gate-based microwave quantum repeater (GBMQR) with encoded bosonic grid states. Each repeater station comprises a transmon and two bosonic resonators: one resonator serving as a stationary quantum memory utilizing autonomous error correction, and the other as an information bus for entanglement generation. Entanglement is generated sequentially through the successful absorption of a microwave photon wavepacket. This method enables deterministic entanglement generation, in contrast to a probabilistic mixing of two heralding signals on a balanced beamsplitter. Furthermore, our GBMQR employs an all-bosonic entanglement swapping Bell-state measurement. This is implemented via a bosonic controlled-Z gate and two separate X-basis projective homodyne measurements on the stationary stored codewords. Our approach circumvents mode-mismatch losses associated with routing and interfering of heralding modes on a beamsplitter, and confines losses to those arising from stationary storage. We evaluate the performance of the proposed quantum repeater by calculating its secret key rate under realistic lab environments. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate that at stationary damping rate of $κ^{-1}_{\\text{damp}}=$~\\SI{40}{\\milli\\second}, GBMQR can achieve entanglement generation and swapping success probabilities approx.~$0.75$, and $0.58$ respectively, surpassing the hallmark success probability of $1/2$ set by ideal linear beamsplitter-based Bell-state measurements.

To identify these error processes we systematically calculate the effect of multi-photon transitions that occur out of the computational space.

In QIA, operators are expressed as structured combinations of basis elements indexed by Boolean codes, allowing products, commutators, and conjugations to be computed through finite rules on discrete indices rather than through dense matrix arithmetic. This representation unifies combinatorial index structure, explicit matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms within a single formalism. Using QIA and its associated block-matrix realization, we reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani hidden-string problem in its phase-oracle form entirely within a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting. We show that, under structured oracle access, the QIA procedure reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly and achieves the same asymptotic query complexity and circuit depth as the standard quantum algorithm. In particular, the hidden string is recovered by symbolic manipulation of a sparse algebraic representation of the oracle rather than by numerical simulation of quantum amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the apparent quantum speed-up in this setting is a consequence of operator structure rather than Hilbert-space dimensionality alone. QIA thus provides a precise language for separating genuinely quantum resources from those arising from algebraic and combinatorial structures and offers a new perspective on the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits."}

The approach explores depth, parametrized gate configurations, and flexible data re-uploading patterns, formulating the construction of quantum regressors as an optimization process. The discovered circuits are evaluated against seventeen classical regression models on twenty-two nonlinear benchmark functions and four analytical functions. Although classical methods often achieve comparable results, they typically require far more parameters, whereas the evolved quantum models remain compact while providing competitive performance. We further analyze dataset complexity using twelve structural descriptors and show, across five increasingly challenging meta-learning scenarios, that these measures can reliably predict which quantum architecture will perform best. The results demonstrate perfect or near-perfect predictive accuracy in several scenarios, indicating that complexity metrics offer powerful and compact representations of dataset structure and can effectively guide automated model selection. Overall, this study provides a principled basis for meta-learning-driven quantum architecture design and advances the understanding of how quantum models behave in regression settings--a topic that has received limited exploration in prior work.

In this context, this paper proposes an $\\mathscr{H}_2$ model reduction method for the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. We first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the physical realizability of the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems, which are more stringent than those for Markovian quantum systems. However, these physical realizability conditions of augmented system model pose non-convex constrains in the optimization problem of model reduction, which makes the problem different from the corresponding classical model reduction problem. To solve the problem, we derive necessary conditions for determining the input matrix in the reduced model, with which a theorem for designing the system matrix of the ancillary system in the reduced system is proved. Building on this, we convert the nonlinear equality constraints into inequality constraints so that a semidefinite programming algorithm can be developed to solve the optimization problem for model reduction.\n  A numerical example of a two-mode linear quantum system driven by three internal modes of a non-Markovian environment validates the effectiveness of our method."}

We address the fundamental challenge of establishing and maintaining quantum entanglement links between satellites operating in free space, where links are subject to both transmission losses and quantum memory decoherence. This paper presents a comprehensive Markov chain model with a state space defined by link storage age and physical distance for analyzing entanglement distribution in noisy dynamic LEO satellite quantum networks. We construct transition matrices that capture system dynamics under varying request arrival rates, and derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including request satisfaction rate, average waiting time, link utilization efficiency, and average consumed link fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the critical trade-offs of higher request rates lead to faster link consumption with higher fidelity but potentially lower satisfaction rates, while lower request rates allow longer storage times at the cost of lower fidelity of increased decoherence effect. Moreover, this paper proves it is reasonable to leave out polarization rotation when the transmission distance is very short (40-50 km).

The study targets 5-qubit (thus 32-class) readout error-correction model. Using the ChipWhisperer Husky for physical voltage glitching, this work leverages an automated algorithm for scanning the fault injection parameter search space to find various successful faults in all the layers of the target ML model. Across repeated trials, this work finds that fault susceptibility is strongly layer-dependent: early-layers demonstrate higher rates of misprediction when faults are triggered in them, whereas later layers have smaller misprediction rates. This work further characterizes the resulting readout failures at the bitstring level using Hamming-distance and per-bit flip statistics, showing that single-shot glitches can induce structured readout corruption rather than purely random noise. These results motivate treating ML-based quantum computer readout and readout correction as a security-critical component of quantum systems and highlight the need for lightweight, deployment-friendly fault detection and redundancy mechanisms in the quantum computer readout pipelines."}

Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements."}

Firstly, the general theoretical framework of optimizing the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) scheme based on the dynamical quantum geometric tensor is given, and then the dynamical quantum geometric tensor and the nonadiabatic transition rate are calculated by taking the detuned $Λ$-type three-level system and tripod-type four-level system for example. Secondly, the transfer dynamics of the particle population of the system are investigated in detail. For a three-level system, the optimal STIRAP scheme has an efficiency of over 98\\% in transferring the population to the final state, while the transfer efficiency of traditional STIRAP is about 72\\%. The superposition states with arbitrary proportions can be efficiently prepared for a four-level system due to the decoupling of the degenerate dark states. Finally, the influences of system parameters, such as the operation time of the Rabi pulses, the amplitude fluctuation and the single-photon detuning, on the transfer process are discussed. Especially, the phenomenon of the adiabatic resonance transfer is revealed. Choosing the pulse parameters in the resonance window can reduce the infidelity of the population transfer to below $10^{-3}$. It is found that the optimal STIRAP scheme by the dynamical quantum geometric tensor provides faster and more efficient transfer than the traditional STIRAP scheme."}

Although Si/SiGe heterostructures are commonly used to host spin qubits due to their high mobility and low percolation density, the SiGe spacer creates a gap between the qubits and control electrodes, which limits the ability to tune exchange coupling. As a result, residual coupling leads to unwanted single-qubit phase shifts, making multi-qubit control more difficult. In this work, we explore swapping the roles of overlapping nanogates to overcome this issue. By reconfiguring the gate voltages, we demonstrate in situ role switching while maintaining multi-qubit control. Additionally, this method significantly improves the tunability of exchange coupling by several orders of magnitude over the traditional approach. This strategy reduces unintended single-qubit phase shifts and minimizes the complexity of multi-qubit control, supporting scalable growth with minimal experimental overhead."}

Notably, only a single real eigenvalue is found before the EP, which differs markedly from typical non-Hermitian systems where a pair of real eigenvalues precedes the EP. The time evolution of observables is further investigated via the Dirac--Frenkel time-dependent variational principle.

In this work, we introduce a simple variant of the model in which this ergodic behaviour is suppressed by introducing a spatial inhomogeneity in the interaction strengths. For this we partition the chain into two equal segments within which the spins interact with different coupling strengths. The ratio of these couplings defines an inhomogeneity parameter, whose variation away from unity leads to constrained dynamics. We characterize this crossover using multiple diagnostics, such as the long-time saturation of out-of-time-ordered correlators, level-spacing statistics, and the spectral form factor. We further examine the consequences for operator growth in Krylov space and for entanglement generation in the system's eigenstates. Together, these results demonstrate that introducing a macroscopic inhomogeneity in coupling strengths provides a minimal, disorder-free route to breaking ergodicity in this specific model of interacting spins."}

The normalized eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenspectra are derived within a non-Hermitian framework, ensuring consistent probability densities. Conditions for the reality of the spectra are established and used to analyze the dependence of eigenvalue behaviour on potential parameters. The study reveals distinct regimes of spectral characteristics arising from the interplay of complex mass, the Morse parameter, and eigenvalues, leading to the emergence of five intrinsic matter types. By analysing the energy eigenspectra, normalization conditions, and probability density profiles across parameter space, we identify regimes corresponding to real-spectrum Hermitian-like matter, quasi-stable or resonant states, purely complex quantum matter, non-physical, non-normalizable states, and a quasi-classical determinate regime in which the probability density becomes spatially static. One of these system exhibits a non-dissipative, collisionless state with long-range gravitational-like characteristics, suggesting a theoretical analogue for dark matter within a non-Hermitian quantum framework. Further, the five identified classes of matter may be interpreted as distinct phases of a single quantum system governed by complex mass and Morse parameters This classification elucidates the boundary between physical and non-physical regimes in complex quantum systems and provides a unified approach for interpreting stability, resonance, and emergent classicality arising from complex parameters."}

The Coulomb and dipole interactions are just the special cases of unified gauge. Remarkably three interactions lead to the same results under the resonant condition of field-atom frequencies, while significant difference appears in red and blue detunings. The QPT is analyzed in terms of spin coherent-state variational method, which indicates the abrupt changes of energy spectrum, average photon number as well as the atomic population at the critical point of interaction constant.

The non-Hermitian atom-field interaction results in the exceptional point (EP), beyond which the semiclassical energy function becomes complex.

For unitary parameter encoding generated by local Hamiltonians, such enhancement is characterized by superlinear scaling of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) with system size. Despite extensive progress, a systematic understanding of which many-body quantum states can exhibit this scaling has remained elusive. Here, we develop a general framework that connects metrological performance to long-range entanglement, state-preparation complexity, and quantum error-correction properties. We prove that super-linear QFI scaling necessarily requires long-range entanglement by deriving rigorous complexity-dependent upper bounds on the QFI. We further show that, for two broad classes of quantum error-correcting codes, nondegenerate codes and Calderbank--Shor--Steane quantum low-density parity-check codes, a nonconstant code distance precludes super-linear QFI scaling for a wide class of local Hamiltonians, revealing a fundamental incompatibility between metrological sensitivity and protection against local noise. Finally, we identify constructive routes that evade this obstruction by exploiting asymmetric code structures. In particular, we show that states associated with classical low-density parity-check codes, as well as asymmetric toric code states, both having asymmetric logical distances, can achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling. Together, our results establish long-range entanglement and asymmetric error correction as the essential resource underlying quantum metrology and clarify the interplay among state complexity, error correction, and metrological power."}

The differences in these architectures arise from the technology that enables the connectivity between physical qubits and the modularity required for the QEC gadgets, which is either based on laser-beam deflectors focused to independent modules hosting mid-size ion crystals, or integrated photonics guided to segmented modules of the trap and allowing for the manipulation of smaller ion crystals. Our approach integrates the transpilation of the QEC gadgets into native trapped-ion primitives and a detailed account of the specific laser addressing and ion transport leading to different amounts of crosstalk errors, motional excitation and idle qubit errors. Combining a microscopically-informed noise model with an efficient Pauli-frame simulator and different scalable decoders, we assess the near-term performance of the color-code memory and teleportation protocols on these architectures. Our analysis demonstrates that modular color-code teleportation is achievable in these near-term trapped-ion architectures, and identifies the integrated-photonics connectivity as the most promising route for longer-term scaling."}

Building on the history matching framework by Lguensat et al.

We benchmark three quantum kernel architectures, distinguished by their quantum feature map circuits. A dimensionality argument implies, in principle, an increased expressivity of the quantum kernels over their classical competitors. For each kernel type, we perform an extensive hyperparameter optimization of our tuning algorithm. We confirm the validity of a quantum-inspired approach based on statevector simulation by numerically demonstrating the superiority of two studied quantum kernels over the canonical classical RBF kernel. Finally, we discuss the pathway towards real quantum hardware, mainly driven by a transition to shot-based simulations and evaluating quantum kernels via randomized measurements, which can mitigate the effect of gate errors. The very low qubit requirements and moderate circuit depths, together with a minimal number of trainable circuit parameters, make our method particularly NISQ-friendly."}

This is particularly relevant in EO, where labeled data are often costly to obtain and limited in availability. However, classical DMs still face significant computational limitations, requiring hundreds to thousands of inference steps, as well as difficulties in capturing the intricate spatial and spectral correlations characteristic of EO data. Recent research in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), including initial attempts of Quantum Generative Models, offers a fundamentally different approach to overcome these challenges. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce the Quanvolutional Conditioned U-Net (QCU-Net), a hybrid quantum--classical architecture that applies quantum operations within a conditioned diffusion framework using a novel quanvolutional feature-extraction approach, for generating synthetic labeled EO imagery. Extensive experiments on the EuroSAT RGB dataset demonstrate that our QCU-Net achieves superior results. Notably, it reduces the Fréchet Inception Distance by 64%, lowers the Kernel Inception Distance by 76%, and yields higher semantic accuracy. Ablation studies further reveal that strategically positioning quantum layers and employing entangling variational circuits enhance model performance and convergence. This work represents the first successful adaptation of class-conditioned quantum diffusion modeling in the EO domain, paving the way for quantum-enhanced remote sensing imagery synthesis."}

In this study, we propose a quantum blockchain protocol whose protection mechanism is directly derived from quantum mechanical principles. The protocol combines high-dimensional Bell states, time-entanglement, entanglement switching, and high-dimensional superdense coding. Encoding classical block information into time-delimited qudit states allows block identity and data verification to be implemented through the causal sequencing of quantum measurements instead of cryptographic hash functions. High-dimensional coding increases the information capacity per quantum carrier and improves noise resistance. Time-entanglement provides distributed authentication, non-repudiation, and tamper detection across the blockchain. Each block derives its own public-private key pair directly from the observed quantum correlations by performing high-dimensional Bell state measurements in successive time steps. Because these keys are dependent on the time ordering of measurements, attempts to alter block data or disrupt the protocol's timing structure inevitably affect the reconstructed correlations and are revealed during validation. Recent advances in the creation and detection of high-dimensional time-slice entanglement demonstrate that the necessary quantum resources are compatible with emerging quantum communication platforms. Taken together, these considerations suggest that the proposed framework can be evaluated as a viable and scalable candidate for quantum-secure blockchain architectures in future quantum network environments."}

The sampling-aware hybrid algorithm achieves a single-shot risk within 1 dB of the -20 dB Bayesian limit using 32 qubits. We extend the Bayesian framework from parameter estimation to global function inference, where the task is to infer a target function of the sensor input drawn from an arbitrary prior, and we demonstrate a clear computational-sensing advantage for direct functional inference over indirect reconstruction. We relate the corresponding Bayesian risk to the Capacity metric and argue that the Resolvable Expressive Capacity provides a natural measure of the space of functions accessible in a single shot. The resulting eigentask analysis identifies noise-robust feature combinations that yield compact estimators with improved accuracy and reduced optimization cost in resource-limited or real-time on-device settings."}

In this context, it is natural to differentiate between states -- and corresponding dynamics -- that involve only finitely many degrees of freedom, referred to as local, and those that are inherently nonlocal. Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons. Finally, we propose that if the generalized boson framework can be physically realized in engineered quantum systems, the phenomena described here may hold significant relevance for both physics and materials science."}

We are left to wonder: does the same hold when the set of accessible measurements is constrained? Such constraints are necessary to account for realistic experimental restrictions. Here, we consider a fully Gaussian scenario focusing on only Gaussian measurements. We prove that the optimal Gaussian measurement protocol remains local, if the information is encoded in either the displacement or the covariance matrix. However, when the information is imprinted on both, this no longer holds true: we construct a simple global Gaussian measurement where the Fisher information becomes super additive. These results can improve parameter estimation tasks via feasible tools. Namely, in quantum optical platforms our proposed global operation requires only passive global operations and single mode Gaussian measurements. We demonstrate this in two examples where we estimate squeezing and losses. While in the former case there is a significant gap between the Fisher information of the optimal Gaussian measurement and the quantum Fisher information for a single copy, this gap can be reduced with joint Gaussian measurements and closed in the asymptotic limit of many copies."}

The core idea is to \\textit{disentangle} the target MPS using a sequence of optimised local unitaries, and then reverse this process to obtain a state preparation circuit. Specifically, we define a loss function directly on the Schmidt spectra of intermediate states and use automatic differentiation to optimise each circuit layer so as to systematically reduce entanglement entropy. Once a disentangling sequence has been learned, we take the adjoints of the optimised unitaries to obtain a shallow-depth circuit that approximately reconstructs the target MPS from the computational all-zero state. We benchmark SSO across a range of MPS approximations to the ground states of local Hamiltonians and demonstrate state-of-the-art shallow-depth performance, improving accuracy by up to an order of magnitude over existing methods.

These issues become especially pronounced in the strong noise regime for gates with fidelities around $90\\%$. To address these limitations, we introduce an extended CSB model together with a fidelity estimate interval (FEI) -- an interval-valued estimate of the target gate fidelity. Numerical simulation demonstrates that FEI remains sufficiently narrow, with its midpoint reliably approximating the true fidelity. We further validate the protocol on a trapped-ion quantum processor by benchmarking two implementations of the three-qubit Toffoli gate.

In particular, we investigate Wolfram model multiway rewriting systems based on string substitutions. Multiway systems were proposed by S. Wolfram as generic model systems for multicomputational processes, emphasizing their significance as a foundation for modeling complexity, nondeterminism, and branching structures of measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $π/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits."}

This consists in a procedure to transform $n$ parallel queries of an arbitrary quantum channel into $n$ parallel queries of the same uniformly random Stinespring isometry, via universal encoding and decoding operations that are efficiently implementable. When the channel is promised to have Choi rank at most $r$, the procedure can be tailored to yield a Stinespring environment of dimension $r$.

In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions.

In this article, we provide an introductory theoretical review on the basic formalisms governing open quantum dynamics under measurement, along with recent developments in their spectral and typical aspects. After reviewing quantum measurement theory, we introduce the concept of quantum trajectories, which are the conditional dynamics of monitored states shaped by a set of measurement outcomes. We then discuss the spectral properties of the dynamical map describing the evolution averaged over measurement outcomes. As has recently been recognized, these spectral features are intimately connected to whether quantum trajectories exhibit typical behaviors, such as the ergodicity and purification. Moreover, we introduce Lyapunov exponents of typical quantum trajectories and discuss how these quantities serve as indicators of measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum many-body systems."}

The stochastic equation governing the state vector trajectory of the qubit can be mapped, in the high-diffusion limit, to the dynamics of a classical persistent Run-and-Tumble Particle (p-RTP) in a bounded one-dimensional domain. The mapping enables us to use analytical results from classical active matter to derive an approximate non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) distribution for the monitored quantum system. The competition between the coherent Rabi drive and the measurement-induced feedback leads to a rich NESS phase displaying Zeno--anti-Zeno transition--which is statistically equivalent to the propulsion-induced trapping observed in confined active particles."}

This quantity, which we denote by $ω_{α,β}$, is parameterized by two positive real numbers $α, β$, and can be seen as a ``Rényi-like\" generalization of the modular commutator -- another entanglement probe proposed as a way to compute the chiral central charge from a bulk wave function. We obtain analytic expressions for $ω_{α,β}$ for gapped ground states of non-interacting fermion Hamiltonians as well as ground states of string-net models. In both cases, we find that $ω_{α,β}$ takes a universal value related to the chiral central charge. For integer values of $α$ and $β$, our quantity $ω_{α,β}$ can be expressed as an expectation value of permutation operators acting on an appropriate replica system, providing a natural route to measuring $ω_{α,β}$ in numerical simulations and potentially, experiments."}
