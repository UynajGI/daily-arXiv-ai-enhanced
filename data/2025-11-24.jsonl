The application of classical optimal control methods, the dynamic programming method and the Pontryagin maximum principle for such a model encounters difficulties associated with the possible non-smoothness of the Bellman function, and in the Pontryagin method the problem is to solve a boundary value problem with discontinuous control. Therefore, in the paper, optimal control is sought in the class of the so-called parametric strategies, which reduces the original problem to a finite-dimensional optimization problem with respect to unknown parameters."}

However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the \"flatness\" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models."}

DIN utilizes an offline-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a powerful prior leaner, which flexibly incorporates sparse, multi-source observational data, including hydraulic head, solute concentration, and hard conductivity data, through conditional injection mechanisms. These conditioning inputs subsequently guide the generative inversion process during sampling. Bypassing iterative forward simulations, DIN leverages stochastic sampling and probabilistic modeling mechanisms to directly generate ensembles of posterior parameter fields by repeatedly executing the reverse denoising process. Two representative posterior scenarios, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, are investigated. The results demonstrate that DIN can produce multiple constraint-satisfying realizations under identical observational conditions, accurately estimate hydraulic-conductivity fields, and achieve reliable uncertainty quantification. The framework exhibits strong generalization capability across diverse data distributions, offering a robust and unified alternative to conventional multi-stage inversion methodologies."}

We ask whether axiomatic no-arbitrage laws, imposed as soft penalties on a learned world model, can reliably align high-capacity RL agents, or mainly create Goodhart-style incentives to exploit model errors. From classical static no-arbitrage conditions we build a finite-dimensional convex volatility law manifold of admissible total-variance surfaces, together with a metric law-penalty functional and a Graceful Failure Index (GFI) that normalizes law degradation under shocks. A synthetic generator produces law-consistent trajectories, while a recurrent neural world model trained without law regularization exhibits structured off-manifold errors. On this testbed we define a Goodhart decomposition \\(r = r^{\\mathcal{M}} + r^\\perp\\), where \\(r^\\perp\\) is ghost arbitrage from off-manifold prediction error. We prove a ghost-arbitrage incentive theorem for PPO-type agents, a law-strength trade-off theorem showing that stronger penalties eventually worsen P\\&L, and a no-free-lunch theorem: under a law-consistent world model and law-aligned strategy class, unconstrained law-seeking RL cannot Pareto-dominate structural baselines on P\\&L, penalties, and GFI. In experiments on an SPX/VIX-like world model, simple structural strategies form the empirical law-strength frontier, while all law-seeking RL variants underperform and move into high-penalty, high-GFI regions. Volatility thus provides a concrete case where reward shaping with verifiable penalties is insufficient for robust law alignment."}

We show that the two-time correlation and response functions depend on both times in the presence of non-reciprocal interactions, reflecting the breakdown of time-translation invariance and the absence of equilibrium at long times. Nevertheless, the long-time relaxation of the two-time observables is governed by exponential decays, in contrast to the slow, power-law relaxation characteristic of the model with purely symmetric interactions. We further show that, when the interactions present antisymmetric correlations of strength $η<0$, there is a time scale $τ(η)$ above which the dynamics undergoes a transition to an oscillatory regime where the two-time observables display periodic oscillations with an exponentially decaying amplitude. Overall, our results give a detailed account of the dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions at zero temperature, providing a benchmark for the study of complex systems with nonlinear and asymmetric interactions."}

In this work, we present an additive Vanka smoother that requires a much lower shift than point-wise smoothers, and thereby enhances the scalability. By carefully designing different ingredients of the multigrid cycle, the presented method enables deep V-cycles with a small and bounded shift, even when many levels are used. We validate our method theoretically by local Fourier analysis, and hold numerical experiments for homogeneous and heterogeneous media.

Contrary to the common approach of applying variance-based (Sobol') sensitivity analysis elementwise, multivariate sensitivity analysis provides a single sensitivity index per parameter, thus allowing for a holistic estimation of parameter importance over the full efficiency map or profile. Its benefits are demonstrated on permanent magnet synchronous machine models of different fidelity. Computations based on Monte Carlo sampling and polynomial chaos expansions are compared in terms of computational cost. The sensitivity analysis results are subsequently used to simplify the models, by fixing non-influential parameters to their nominal values and allowing random variations only for influential parameters. Uncertainty estimates obtained with the full and reduced models confirm the validity of model simplification guided by multivariate sensitivity analysis."}

Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism."}

Although classical methodologies focus on minimizing the expectation of a random loss, in many applications, risk-averse decision-makers may be interested in minimizing a specific quantile as a more prudent alternative. In this paper, we propose a new risk-averse contextual stochastic optimization problem with a quantile objective for general two-stage problems. Given historical data on the model's random parameters and contextual information, we model the conditional quantile by replacing the conditional expectation in its variational characterization with a generic estimator. Under two sets of mild regularity conditions, we derive the asymptotic almost-sure convergence and convergence in probability of the optimal solution and the optimal value of the associated optimization problem to their true counterparts. Optimization problems with a quantile objective is usually non-convex, which are generally regarded as challenging to solve. To address the computational difficulties, we propose a new stochastic inexact constraint generation method with convergence guarantee. Finally, through numerical experiments on a single-server appointment scheduling problem, we study the computational performance of our proposed solution method as well as operational performance of our proposed methodology. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating useful contextual information and decision-maker's risk attitude into the optimization model."}

While Montanari (2018) eventually gave a sophisticated message-passing algorithm to do this nearly optimally for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, Parisi (2003) observed earlier that a simple yet unusual algorithm seems to perform just as well: perform local reluctant search, repeatedly making the local adjustment improving the objective function by the smallest possible amount. This is in contrast to the more intuitive local greedy search that repeatedly makes the local adjustment improving the objective by the largest possible amount. We study empirically how the performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of entries of the coupling matrix in the SK model. We find evidence that, while the runtime of greedy search enjoys universality over a broad range of distributions, the runtime of reluctant search surprisingly is not universal, sometimes depending quite sensitively on the entry distribution. We propose that one mechanism leading to this non-universality is a change in the behavior of reluctant search when the couplings have discrete support on an evenly-spaced grid, and give experimental results supporting this proposal and investigating other properties of a distribution that might affect the performance of reluctant search."}

This study develops a Structure-Function Coherent Coarsening (SFCC) framework that preserves both hydrological connectivity and functional heterogeneity during model input coarsening. We apply the VELMA model to 24 subbasins in the Salish Sea Basin, U.S. and examine three types of inputs: (i) DEM coarsened with a Hydro-aware approach that preserves drainage topology; (ii) land-use and soil-type datasets coarsened with function-preserving methods (Auto-weight and Auto-reassign) that retain small but process-dominant classes; and (iii) initial conditions coarsened with hydrology-, land-cover-, and soil-aware strategies to enhance temporal stability. Results show that the Hydro-aware method effectively preserves watershed morphology and yields more consistent runoff and nitrate predictions than mean-based coarsening across scales. For categorical inputs, the function-preserving methods alleviate the dominant-class bias of majority aggregation, particularly in basins where small high-impact patches drive nitrogen export. Long-term simulations further show that although hydrological variables equilibrate rapidly and biogeochemical processes adjust more gradually, deviations in both decrease over time and converge toward a steady state. These demonstrate that structural consistency and functional preservation together maintain dynamic stability through spatiotemporal feedback. Compared with existing work, the proposed SFCC framework operates directly at the data-input level, enabling more coherent integration of multi-source datasets and maximizing the retention of high-resolution information."}

While SA is commonly used to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, many practical problems are more naturally formulated using integer variables. We therefore study quadratic and higher-order unconstrained integer optimization (QUIO and HUIO) problems, which generalize QUBO by allowing integer-valued variables and higher-order interactions. Conventional approaches often convert these problems into QUBO formulations through binary encoding and the reduction of higher-order terms. Such conversions, however, greatly increase the number of variables and interactions, resulting in long computation times and, for large-scale problems, even making the conversion itself a dominant computational bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient framework that directly applies SA to QUIO and HUIO problems without converting them into QUBO. Within this framework, we introduce an optimal-transition Metropolis method, designed to improve efficiency when the variable bounds are wide, and evaluate its performance alongside the conventional Metropolis and heat bath methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed direct approach achieves higher efficiency and solution quality than the conventional QUBO-based formulation and reveal the practical advantages of the optimal-transition Metropolis method. The algorithm developed in this study is available as part of the open-source library OpenJij, which provides a Python interface with a C++ backend."}

For spatial discretizations, the MC component computes a piecewise-constant (cell-averaged) solution, while the \\(S_N\\) stage employs bilinear discontinuous finite elements. By hybridizing the formulation, the MC subproblem after a prescribed scatter limit becomes scattering-free, yielding a simple and efficient streaming/attenuation procedure. Between time steps, a simple scatter-free MC step is run to relabel the $S_N$ solution as an MC solution.\n  A key feature of the approach is a tunable parameter \\(N_{s}\\) that controls how many material collisions are handled in the (Q)MC leg before handing off to the deterministic \\(S_N\\) solve; \\(N_s=0\\) recovers a purely uncollided MC leg, while \\(N_s>0\\) produces multi-scatter hybrids.

Despite its promise in aerospace, automotive, and other high-performance applications, current GD methods face critical challenges: AI approaches require large datasets and often struggle to generalize; topology optimization is computationally intensive and difficult to extend to multiphysics problems; and model order reduction for evolving geometries remains underdeveloped. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified, structure-preserving framework for GD based on optimal transport (OT), enabling simultaneous interpolation of complex geometries and their associated physical solution fields across evolving design spaces, even with non-matching meshes and substantial shape changes. This capability leverages Gaussian splatting to provide a continuous, mesh-independent representation of the solution and Wasserstein barycenters to enable smooth, mathematically ''mass''-preserving blending of geometries, offering a major advance over surrogate models tied to static meshes. Our framework efficiently interpolates positive scalar fields across arbitrarily shaped, evolving geometries without requiring identical mesh topology or dimensionality. OT also naturally preserves localized physical features -- such as stress concentrations or sharp gradients -- by conserving the spatial distribution of quantities, interpreted as ''mass'' in a mathematical sense, rather than averaging them, avoiding artificial smoothing. Preliminary extensions to signed and vector fields are presented. Representative test cases demonstrate enhanced efficiency, adaptability, and physical fidelity, establishing a foundation for future foundation-model-powered generative design workflows."}

Leveraging translational invariance and other symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we reconstruct the momentum-resolved quasiparticle excitation spectrum through targeted simulation of low-lying excited states using VQE. We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz.

By using six large-scale datasets, comprising over 500 million Telegram messages collected between 2015 and 2024, we analyze toxic user behavior across multiple chats and languages. We introduce a methodological framework that models user adaptation through a conformity index, capturing conformist, anti-conformist, and independent behavioral tendencies. Our findings show that most users tend to conform to local normative environments, adjusting their toxicity to match the toxicity levels of the chats in which they participate. These patterns are consistent across datasets and languages, suggesting that community norms and social influence play a decisive role in shaping user behavior online. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exposure to these norms, in terms of increased user participation in chats, is associated with a stronger tendency toward conformity with the surrounding social contexts.

The Win Ratio (WR) measure and more general frameworks of Win Statistics have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional time-to-first-event analyses. Although analytic sample size formulas for WR have been developed, they rely on design parameters that are often not straightforward to specify. Consequently, sample size determination in clinical trials with WR as the primary analysis is most often based on simulations, which can be computationally intensive. Moreover, these simulations commonly assume independence among component endpoints, an assumption that may not hold in practice and can lead to misleading power estimates. To address this challenge, we derive refined formulas to calculate the proportions of wins, losses, and ties for multiple prioritized time-to-event endpoints. These formulas rely on familiar design inputs and become directly applicable when integrated with existing sample size methods. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of how correlation among endpoints affects sample size requirements across varying design features. We further demonstrate the role of correlations through two case studies based on the landmark SPRINT and STICH clinical trials to generate further insights."}

Recently, Hoff (2023) showed that full conformal Bayes provides the most efficient prediction sets (smallest by expected volume) among all prediction sets that are valid at the $(1 - α)$ level if the model is correctly specified. However, a critical issue arises when the Bayesian model itself may be mis-specified, resulting in prediction set that might be suboptimal, even though it still enjoys the frequentist coverage guarantee. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative solution that combines Bayesian model averaging (BMA) with conformal prediction. This hybrid not only leverages the strengths of Bayesian conformal prediction but also introduces a layer of robustness through model averaging. Theoretically, we prove that the resulting prediction set will converge to the optimal level of efficiency, if the true model is included among the candidate models. This assurance of optimality, even under potential model uncertainty, provides a significant improvement over existing methods, ensuring more reliable and precise uncertainty quantification."}

We show that the two-time correlation and response functions depend on both times in the presence of non-reciprocal interactions, reflecting the breakdown of time-translation invariance and the absence of equilibrium at long times. Nevertheless, the long-time relaxation of the two-time observables is governed by exponential decays, in contrast to the slow, power-law relaxation characteristic of the model with purely symmetric interactions. We further show that, when the interactions present antisymmetric correlations of strength $η<0$, there is a time scale $τ(η)$ above which the dynamics undergoes a transition to an oscillatory regime where the two-time observables display periodic oscillations with an exponentially decaying amplitude. Overall, our results give a detailed account of the dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions at zero temperature, providing a benchmark for the study of complex systems with nonlinear and asymmetric interactions."}

Our experiments reveal an unexpected and pronounced field-induced asymmetry in the bias-flux response of the circuits, which is demonstrated to originate from a field-induced Josephson-diode effect within the nano-constrictions and which considerably enhances the circuit figures of merit in a magnetic field. An intuitive macroscopic Josephson-diode model attributes the effect to inhomogeneous constriction properties and provides us with the diode current-phase relation as a function of the in-plane field.

In the former phase all four spins of each square plaquette form a collective plaquette singlet, whereas in the latter phase two dimer singlets are formed along diagonals of each square plaquette. These bound two-magnon states, supplemented with three localized one-magnon states, enable us to elaborate a generalized localized-magnon theory that is applicable in a frustrated regime across the entire field range as confirmed by comparison with exact diagonalization data. The concept of localized magnons provides a consistent description of low-temperature magnetization curves featuring intermediate one-fifth and three-fifths plateaus, which intersect each other at temperature-independent crossing points determined by the relative degeneracies of competing bound-magnon phases. Field variations of the specific heat reveal a pronounced double-peak structure near each field-driven transition with peak heights depending on the relative degeneracies of the respective bound-magnon states.

For one-dimensional critical systems, however, excited states can be directly accessed from the eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian that is constructed from the ground state obtained by variational matrix product state (MPS) optimization. Despite its numerical success, the theoretical mechanism underlying this method has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes."}

We demonstrate the method via application to the many-analysts study on racial bias in soccer, the many-analysts study of marital status and cardiovascular disease, and the multiverse study on technology use and well-being. The results show how single-dataset meta-analysis complements the qualitative evaluation of many-analysts and multiverse studies."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. We present recent advancements on these topics including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. We also highlight the scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice."}

An important goal is to understand how the source data may improve the minimax convergence rate of learning the regression function when the likelihood ratio of the covariate marginal distributions of the target data and the source data are unbounded. A previous work of Pathak et al. (2022) show that the minimax transfer learning rate is simply determined by the faster rate of using either the source or the target data alone. In this paper, we present a new synergistic learning phenomenon (SLP) that the minimax convergence rate based on both data may sometimes be faster (even much faster) than the better rate of convergence based on the source or target data only. The SLP occurs when and only when the target sample size is smaller (in order) than but not too much smaller than the source sample size in relation to the smoothness of the regression function and the nature of the covariate densities of the source and target distributions. Interestingly, the SLP happens in two different ways according to the relationship between the two sample sizes. One is that the target data help alleviate the difficulty in estimating the regression function at points where the density of the source data is close to zero and the other is that the source data (with its larger sample size than that of the target data) help the estimation at points where the density of the source data is not small. Extensions to handle unknown source and target parameters and smoothness of the regression function are also obtained."}

Structural dynamics of the elites in a society have been proposed to be one of the core drivers shaping long term behavior. As current models and data are rather macroscopic, the emergence of macroscopic behavior from microscopic dynamics is largely unclear. Here, we introduce an adaptive network model of directed links representing political power and competing political ideas, based on local dynamical rules, only. The model is based on two socially motivated behaviors: the cumulative advantage effect of political power and intra-elite conflict. We observe punctuated equilibria as an emergent behavior and find a phase transition towards a disordered phase. We define an advance warning measure for elite collapse and find that the states of only a few largest nodes are suitable as a proxy with predictive information."}

This is challenging when detecting quantities that are obscured by such noise. Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches.

It is considered as an open system in a fixed volume partitioned into a large number of congruent cubic cells. The interaction potential comprises two competing components: a global uniform attraction acting between all particle pairs in the volume and a short-range repulsion between particles occupying the same cell. Previous studies have established that this model admits an exact solution, exhibits multiple critical points, and undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions. Despite variations in the interaction strengths, no triple point appears as long as these parameters remain fixed. We demonstrate that incorporating effective {temperature-dependent} attractive interactions fundamentally alters the phase behavior of the cell model. This modification preserves the model's exact solvability while resulting in the emergence of a triple point in the phase diagram."}

Focusing on permutation constrained objectives, we show that the standard generic QAOA ansatz, with a transverse field mixer and diagonal r local cost, faces an intrinsic feasibility bottleneck: even after angle optimization, circuits whose depth grows at most linearly with n cannot raise the total probability mass on the feasible manifold much above the uniform baseline suppressed by the size of the full Hilber space. Against this envelope we introduce a minimal constraint enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) that operates directly inside a product one hot subspace and mixes with a block local XY Hamiltonian. For permutation constrained problems, we prove an angle robust, depth matched exponential enhancement where the ratio between the feasible mass from CE QAOA and generic QAOA grows exponentially in $n^2$ for all depths up to a linear fraction of n, under a mild polynomial growth condition on the interaction hypergraph. Thanks to the problem algorithm co design in the kernel construction, the techniques and guarantees extend beyond permutations to a broad class of NP-Hard constrained optimization problems."}

Our approach advances the existing literature in two important respects. First, we consider the problem under privacy constraints. Second, instead of testing whether the coordinates are pairwise independent, we are interested in determining whether certain pairwise associations between the components (such as all pairwise Kendall's $τ$ coefficients) do not exceed a given threshold in absolute value. Considering hypotheses of this form is motivated by the observation that in the high-dimensional regime, it is rare and perhaps impossible to have a null hypothesis that can be modeled exactly by assuming that all pairwise associations are precisely equal to zero.\n  The formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis makes the problem of constructing tests already non-standard in the non-private setting. Additionally, under privacy constraints, state of the art procedures rely on permutation approaches that are rendered invalid under a composite null. We propose a novel bootstrap based methodology that is especially powerful in sparse settings, develop theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and show that the proposed method enjoys good finite sample properties even in the high privacy regime.

Specifically, we show that as a sequence of approximating regime switching models converges to the true model, the associated value functions and optimal policies converge as well, ensuring vanishing performance loss.

This hydrodynamic behavior coupled with effects of Berry curvature arising from band structure can give rise to novel vortical transport coefficients relating the stress tensor to gradients in the electrostatic potential and temperature. These coefficients have been calculated in the absence of a magnetic field and have been shown to depend only on the equilibrium distribution function~\\cite{Chadha_Mukerjee2024}. In this paper, we first obtain an expression for the viscosity tensor and show that the Berry curvature generates odd components of the viscosity tensor arising from the intrinsic angular momentum of the Bloch wavepackets. We calculate the viscosity tensor for a two-dimensional microscopic model of tilted Dirac cones. We next obtain the vortical coefficients and the viscosity tensor in the presence of a magnetic field and extend the Onsager relations for them to include both the magnetic field and the Berry curvature. We show that the field dependence of the coefficients manifests itself in the non-equilibrium part of the distribution function and calculate them to second order in the electron-electron scattering time. We explicitly show that the expressions we obtain are consistent with the Onsager relations."}

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are powerful tools for modelling time-series data with underlying state structure. However, selecting appropriate parametric forms for the state-dependent distributions is often challenging and can lead to model misspecification. To address this, P-spline-based nonparametric estimation of state-dependent densities has been proposed. While offering great flexibility, these approaches can result in overly complex densities (e.g. bimodal) that hinder interpretability. 2. We propose a straightforward method that builds on shape-constrained spline theory to enforce unimodality in the estimated state-dependent densities through enforcing unimodality of the spline coefficients. This constraint strikes a practical balance between model flexibility, interpretability, and parsimony. 3. Through two simulation studies and a real-world case study using narwhal (Monodon monoceros) dive data, we demonstrate the proposed approach yields more stable estimates compared to fully flexible, unconstrained models improving model performance and interpretability. 4. Our method bridges a key methodological gap, by providing a parsimonious HMM framework that balances the interpretability of parametric models with the flexibility of nonparametric estimation. This provides ecologists with a powerful tool to derive ecologically meaningful inference from telemetry data while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex models."}

We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the stepwise maximum likelihood estimator for vine copulas when the number of parameters diverges as $n \\to \\infty$. Our theoretical results cover both parametric and nonparametric estimation of the marginal distributions, as well as truncated vines, and are also applicable to general estimation problems, particularly other sequential procedures. Numerical experiments suggest that the derived assumptions are satisfied if the pair copulas in higher trees converge to independence copulas sufficiently fast. A simulation study substantiates these findings and identifies settings in which estimation becomes challenging. In particular, the vine structure strongly affects estimation accuracy, with D-vines being more difficult to estimate than C-vines, and estimates in Gumbel vines exhibit substantially larger biases than those in Gaussian vines."}

Across disciplines, from sociology to neuroscience and machine learning, signed networks provide a shared language to formalise duality, balance, and opposition as integral components of system behaviour. This review provides a comprehensive and foundational summary of signed network theory. It formalises the mathematical principles of signed graphs and surveys signed-network-specific measures, including signed degree distributions, clustering, centralities, motifs, and Laplacians. It revisits balance theory, tracing its cognitive and structural formulations and their connections to frustration. Structural aspects of signed networks are examined, analysing key topics such as null models, node embeddings, sign prediction, and community detection. Subsequent sections address dynamical processes on and of signed networks, such as opinion dynamics, contagion models, and data-driven approaches for studying evolving networks. Practical challenges in constructing, inferring and validating signed data from real-world systems are also highlighted, and we offer an overview of currently available datasets. We also address common pitfalls and challenges that arise when modelling or analysing signed data. Overall, this review integrates theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, and cross-domain examples, providing a structured entry point and a reference framework for researchers interested in the study of signed networks in complex systems."}

One key advantage of the proposed B&C algorithm is that the number of variables in the underlying formulation grows only linearly with the number of customers and facility locations and is one-order of magnitude smaller than that in the underlying formulation of a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in the literature. Moreover, we propose two new families of strong valid inequalities, called enhanced outer-approximation and lifted subadditive inequalities, to strengthen the LP relaxation and speed up the convergence of the proposed B&C algorithm. In extensive computational experiments on a testbed of 240 benchmark MPCLP instances, we show that, thanks to the small problem size and the strong LP relaxation of the underlying formulation, the proposed B&C algorithm significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in terms of running time, number of nodes in the search tree, and number of solved instances.

Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim."}

It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges."}

This paper addresses these limitations by systematically evaluating several alternative boxplots specifically designed to accommodate distributional asymmetry. We introduce ggskewboxplots, an R package that integrates multiple robust and skewness-aware boxplot variants, providing a unified and user-friendly framework for exploratory data analysis. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations under controlled skewness and kurtosis conditions, implemented via the mosaic approach based on the Skewed Exponential Power distribution, we assess the sensitivity and specificity of each method. Simulation results indicate that classical Tukey-style boxplots are highly prone to swamping and masking, whereas robust skewness-adjusted variants -- particularly those leveraging quartile-based skewness measures or medcouple-based adjustments -- achieve substantially better performance. These findings offer practical guidance for selecting reliable boxplot methods in applied settings and demonstrate how the ggskewboxplots package facilitates accessible, distribution-aware visualizations within the familiar ggplot2 workflow."}

The key idea behind these algorithms is to fully leverage the information of negative term \\bm{$-\\|x^k-\\hat{x}^{k-1}\\|^2$} in order to design the extrapolation step. This concept of using negative terms to improve acceleration can be extended to other algorithms as well.

Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains. We also discuss how the correlated phase of the isolated chain is characterized by boundary zeros in its single-particle Green's function, and briefly comment on their localization properties in relation to the boundary spins."}

As a generalization of two widely applied risk measures, Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) and Conditional Expected Shortfall (CoES) have recently been receiving growing attention on applications in economics and finance, since they serve as crucial metrics for systemic risk measurement. However, existing approaches confront some challenges in statistical inference and asymptotic theories when estimating CoES, particularly at high risk levels. In this paper, within a framework of upper tail dependence, we propose several extrapolative methods to estimate both extreme CoVaR and CoES nonparametrically via an adjustment factor, which are intimately related to the nonparametric modelling of the tail dependence function. In addition, we study the asymptotic theories of all proposed extrapolative methods based on multivariate extreme value theory. Finally, some simulations and real data analyses are conducted to demonstrate the empirical performances of our methods."}

In this paper, we clarify that this restriction is not required: a well-defined estimand can be formulated without indexing on the elimination of such events. Achieving this requires a more precise classification of right-censoring events than has historically been considered, as the nature of these events has direct implications for identification of the target estimand. We provide a framework that distinguishes different types of right-censoring events from a causal perspective, and demonstrate how this framework relates to censoring definitions and assumptions in classical survival analysis literature. By bridging these perspectives, we provide a clearer understanding of how to handle right-censoring events and provide guidance for identifying causal estimands when right-censored events are present."}

Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim."}

(2002) for atmospheric modeling, enables efficient and mass conservative semi Lagrangian (SL) transport through successive one dimensional remapping. While widely used in geophysical flows, its application to plasma kinetics remains limited. To exploit its potential advantages in conservation and scalability, this work applies the conservative cascade semi Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme to the Vlasov equation and related plasma models. A consistency analysis shows that the scheme attains second order spatial accuracy, with the dominant error arising from the geometric approximation of the backtracked region. Moreover, two improvements are introduced: a freestream preserving correction that ensures exact volume conservation, and a maximum principle limiter that suppresses spurious oscillations while maintaining positivity and mass conservation. Numerical tests, including linear advection, guiding center, and relativistic Vlasov Maxwell models, confirm the high accuracy, robustness, and long term stability of the improved CCSL method. Compared with the conservative semi Lagrangian (CSL) and the backward semi Lagrangian (BSL) schemes, it better preserves physical invariants under divergence free conditions, providing a robust and efficient framework for high-fidelity plasma kinetic simulations with good parallel scalability."}

Bridging the behavior observed in 1D and 3D systems, the $T_1^{-1}$ relaxation rate shows a pronounced peak extending well above the Néel temperature $T_N$, indicating strong two-dimensional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-type fluctuations.

The experimental unit information index (EUII) is based on power, Type-I error and sample size, and has attractive interpretations both in terms of frequentist error rates and Bayesian posterior odds. We introduce the EUII in simple statistical test settings and show that its asymptotic value depends only on the assumed relative effect size under the alternative.

The increasing prevalence of panel data, characterized by multiple related time series, therefore necessitates the development of inference algorithms that are effective for this class of high-dimensional mechanistic models. Nonlinear, non-Gaussian mechanistic models are routinely fitted to time series data but seldom to panel data, despite its widespread availability, suggesting that the practical difficulties for existing procedures are prohibitive. We investigate the use of iterated filtering algorithms for this purpose. We introduce a novel algorithm that contains a marginalization step that mitigates issues arising from particle filtering in high dimensions.

For algebraic Riccati equations, homogeneous strictly positive systems can be constructed, which exhibit more complex dynamical behaviors.

While Montanari (2018) eventually gave a sophisticated message-passing algorithm to do this nearly optimally for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, Parisi (2003) observed earlier that a simple yet unusual algorithm seems to perform just as well: perform local reluctant search, repeatedly making the local adjustment improving the objective function by the smallest possible amount. This is in contrast to the more intuitive local greedy search that repeatedly makes the local adjustment improving the objective by the largest possible amount. We study empirically how the performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of entries of the coupling matrix in the SK model. We find evidence that, while the runtime of greedy search enjoys universality over a broad range of distributions, the runtime of reluctant search surprisingly is not universal, sometimes depending quite sensitively on the entry distribution. We propose that one mechanism leading to this non-universality is a change in the behavior of reluctant search when the couplings have discrete support on an evenly-spaced grid, and give experimental results supporting this proposal and investigating other properties of a distribution that might affect the performance of reluctant search."}

Submitted to Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy", "summary": "The large penetration of distributed generations impacts both the secondary low-voltage (LV) and the primary medium-voltage (MV) segments of the distribution network. Optimizing power flow calculations for the integrated MV/LV networks is crucial for the real-time management of modern distribution networks. Traditional methods in symmetrical coordinates are primarily limited to the three-wire model of three-phase networks, often leading to inaccuracies in power flow calculations when applied to three-phase four-wire LV segments. This paper introduces a novel power flow method for integrated three-wire MV and four-wire LV networks. Using eigenvector decomposition to diagonalize the admittance matrix of four-wire LV lines, the proposed method improves the computational efficiency of power flow calculations and accurately calculates the neutral-to-ground voltage. The results of the case studies show over 50\\% reduction in the number of non-zero elements in the LU factors of the bus admittance matrix, and speed-up factors of 2.78 on the IEEE 123-node test system and 3.63 on the IEEE 8500-node test system in execution times for Volt/Var control (VVC), compared to the phase coordinates model."}

While provably efficient protocols for Markovian models of quantum simulators, either closed system models (described by a Hamiltonian) or open system models (described by a Lindbladian), have been developed, it remains less well understood whether similar protocols for non-Markovian models exist. In this paper, we consider geometrically local lattice models with both quantum and classical non-Markovian noise and show that, under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, we can learn the noise with sample complexity scaling logarithmically with the system size. Our protocol requires preparing the simulator qubits initially in a product state, introducing a layer of single-qubit Clifford gates and measuring product observables."}

Structural dynamics of the elites in a society have been proposed to be one of the core drivers shaping long term behavior. As current models and data are rather macroscopic, the emergence of macroscopic behavior from microscopic dynamics is largely unclear. Here, we introduce an adaptive network model of directed links representing political power and competing political ideas, based on local dynamical rules, only. The model is based on two socially motivated behaviors: the cumulative advantage effect of political power and intra-elite conflict. We observe punctuated equilibria as an emergent behavior and find a phase transition towards a disordered phase. We define an advance warning measure for elite collapse and find that the states of only a few largest nodes are suitable as a proxy with predictive information."}

In this context, doses and schedules of novel therapies may be inadequately characterized and oncology drug dose-finding approaches should be revised. This is increasingly recognized by health authorities, notably through the Optimus project. We developed a Bayesian dose-finding design, called U-DESPE, which allows to either determine the optimal dosing regimen at the end of the dose-escalation phase, or use of dedicated cohorts for randomizing patients to candidate optimal dosing regimens after that safe dosing regimens have been found. U-DESPE design relies on a dose-exposure model built from pharmacokinetic data using non-linear mixed-effect modeling approaches. Then three models are built to assess the relationships between exposure and the probability of selected relevant endpoints on safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics. These models are then combined to predict the different endpoints for every candidate dosing regimens. Finally, a utility function is proposed to quantify the trade-off between these endpoints and to determine the optimal dosing regimen. We applied the proposed method on a clinical trial case study and performed an extensive simulation study to evaluate the operating characteristics of the method."}

In this paper, we clarify that this restriction is not required: a well-defined estimand can be formulated without indexing on the elimination of such events. Achieving this requires a more precise classification of right-censoring events than has historically been considered, as the nature of these events has direct implications for identification of the target estimand. We provide a framework that distinguishes different types of right-censoring events from a causal perspective, and demonstrate how this framework relates to censoring definitions and assumptions in classical survival analysis literature. By bridging these perspectives, we provide a clearer understanding of how to handle right-censoring events and provide guidance for identifying causal estimands when right-censored events are present."}

A central challenge in many-body physics is that the identity of quantum phases, especially those with topological order, are often inaccessible through local observables or simple symmetry-breaking diagnostics. Here, we apply QDL techniques to the 2+1-dimensional toric-code loop-gas model in a magnetic field. Ground states are generated across multiple lattice sizes using a parametrized loop-gas circuit (PLGC) with a variational quantum-eigensolver (VQE) approach. We then train a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) across the full field-parameter range to perform phase classification and capture the overall phase structure. We also employ a physics-aware training protocol that excludes the near-critical region (0.2 <= x <= 0.4)) around (x_c = 0.25), the phase-transition point estimated by quantum Monte Carlo, reserving this window for testing to evaluate the ability of the model to learn the phase transition. In parallel, we implement an unsupervised quantum k-means method based on state overlaps, which partitions the dataset into two phases without prior labeling. Our supervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and accurately locates the phase transition, in close agreement with previously reported values; the unsupervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and locates the phase transition with a small offset as expected in finite volumes; both QDL methods outperform classical alternatives. These findings establish QDL as an effective framework for characterizing topological quantum matter, studying finite volume effects, and probing phase diagrams of higher-dimensional systems."}

While Montanari (2018) eventually gave a sophisticated message-passing algorithm to do this nearly optimally for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, Parisi (2003) observed earlier that a simple yet unusual algorithm seems to perform just as well: perform local reluctant search, repeatedly making the local adjustment improving the objective function by the smallest possible amount. This is in contrast to the more intuitive local greedy search that repeatedly makes the local adjustment improving the objective by the largest possible amount. We study empirically how the performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of entries of the coupling matrix in the SK model. We find evidence that, while the runtime of greedy search enjoys universality over a broad range of distributions, the runtime of reluctant search surprisingly is not universal, sometimes depending quite sensitively on the entry distribution. We propose that one mechanism leading to this non-universality is a change in the behavior of reluctant search when the couplings have discrete support on an evenly-spaced grid, and give experimental results supporting this proposal and investigating other properties of a distribution that might affect the performance of reluctant search."}

In this study, we analyze simultaneous gate operations on multiple qubits using microwaves transmitted via a single cable in a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme. By employing rectangular control microwave pulses, we reveal the contribution of drive frequency spacing to gate fidelity. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal microwave signals suppress interference in simultaneously driven qubits, thereby ensuring high gate fidelity.

Variational arguments rigorously establish two distinct fragmented phases in the frustrated regime. In the former phase all four spins of each square plaquette form a collective plaquette singlet, whereas in the latter phase two dimer singlets are formed along diagonals of each square plaquette. These bound two-magnon states, supplemented with three localized one-magnon states, enable us to elaborate a generalized localized-magnon theory that is applicable in a frustrated regime across the entire field range as confirmed by comparison with exact diagonalization data. The concept of localized magnons provides a consistent description of low-temperature magnetization curves featuring intermediate one-fifth and three-fifths plateaus, which intersect each other at temperature-independent crossing points determined by the relative degeneracies of competing bound-magnon phases. Field variations of the specific heat reveal a pronounced double-peak structure near each field-driven transition with peak heights depending on the relative degeneracies of the respective bound-magnon states.

In this context, commonly used Monte Carlo inference procedures for model selection and parameter estimation quickly become computationally unfeasible as the system dimension grows. The increasing prevalence of panel data, characterized by multiple related time series, therefore necessitates the development of inference algorithms that are effective for this class of high-dimensional mechanistic models. Nonlinear, non-Gaussian mechanistic models are routinely fitted to time series data but seldom to panel data, despite its widespread availability, suggesting that the practical difficulties for existing procedures are prohibitive. We investigate the use of iterated filtering algorithms for this purpose. We introduce a novel algorithm that contains a marginalization step that mitigates issues arising from particle filtering in high dimensions. Our approach enables likelihood-based inference for models that were previously considered intractable, thus broadening the scope of dynamic models available for panel data analysis."}

Subsequently, Lakhani (2025) extended this conditioning framework to encompass distributional families whose marginal densities may exhibit unimodality and skewness, thereby moving beyond families with non-increasing densities. The present study builds on this line of work by proposing a conditional survival specification derived from a location-scale distributional family, where the dependence between $X$ and $Y$ arises not only through the acceleration function but also via a location function. An illustrative example of this new specification is developed using a Weibull marginal for $X$. The resulting models are fully characterized by closed-form expressions for their moments, and simulations are implemented using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

Our approach advances the existing literature in two important respects. First, we consider the problem under privacy constraints. Second, instead of testing whether the coordinates are pairwise independent, we are interested in determining whether certain pairwise associations between the components (such as all pairwise Kendall's $τ$ coefficients) do not exceed a given threshold in absolute value. Considering hypotheses of this form is motivated by the observation that in the high-dimensional regime, it is rare and perhaps impossible to have a null hypothesis that can be modeled exactly by assuming that all pairwise associations are precisely equal to zero.\n  The formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis makes the problem of constructing tests already non-standard in the non-private setting. Additionally, under privacy constraints, state of the art procedures rely on permutation approaches that are rendered invalid under a composite null. We propose a novel bootstrap based methodology that is especially powerful in sparse settings, develop theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and show that the proposed method enjoys good finite sample properties even in the high privacy regime.

Here, we report the integration of a cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in the telecom C-band with a frequency-multiplexed atomic frequency comb memory. The bow-tie cavity source was simultaneously resonant at 606 nm and 1550 nm, generating non-degenerate photon pairs exhibiting a clustered frequency-comb spectrum. The atomic frequency comb memory, implemented in Praseodymium-doped Yttrium Orthosilicate crystals, provided up to 83 frequency modes with 123 MHz spacing and enabled broadband storage of 606 nm signal photons. By filtering the main cluster, we obtained $32.7 \\pm 4.8$ effective modes, as confirmed from coincidence measurements. Importantly, we observed strong nonclassical correlations after storage, with cross-correlation values of $g_{s,i}^{(2)} = 8.1\\pm0.7$.

We demonstrate that, under the identical conditions, the relaxation dynamics of a qubit initialized in a thermal state with a higher temperature can be exponentially faster than those of a colder thermal state. Strikingly, this acceleration is determined solely by the initial temperature of the system, independent of other parameters.

In particular, heat removal is directly linked to a fundamental requirement of quantum computation: the ability to reset a system to a pure state before computation. Efficient cooling is therefore crucial both for advancing our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and for enabling the development of modern quantum technologies. In this work, we devise a cooling task that exploits steerability, a fundamental form of quantum correlations, to demonstrate a provable quantum advantage over classically correlated scenarios in which steerability is absent. We quantify this advantage by the ratio between the heat removed using steerable quantum correlations and the heat removed using unsteerable classical correlations. Specifically, we show that steerable quantum correlations always provide a thermodynamic advantage in the cooling task. Remarkably, we further establish that the maximum achievable advantage is directly related to a geometric measure of steerability known as steerability robustness. Our results suggest that this thermodynamic advantage can serve as a witness of steerability. Finally, we present examples showing that the advantage can increase with the dimension of the underlying system."}

By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL."}

We investigate the early-time dynamics in the transition between the strong and weak driving regimes using: i) angular-dependent observables such as the light emitted by the cloud, and ii) global observables, i.e., the excited state population. When driving the cloud on-resonance, we find that as a function of the driving frequency, the behavior of the collected light at certain angles transitions from the single-photon subradiant regime to a superradiant regime while the behavior of the excited state population does not show superradiance. The experiment shows good agreement with numerical predictions in the regime of parameters under study."}

Spectroscopic measurements serve as an effective means of elucidating detailed information about the system, such as the energy-level structure and the transition matrix elements of the KPO. Conventional spectroscopy requires the drive frequency to match an energy spacing with a nonzero transition matrix element. In recent years, a phenomenon called photonic resonance (PR) has been theoretically predicted in KPO spectroscopy. Specifically, resonance occurs under the condition that the detuning is set to $n/2$ times the Kerr nonlinearity, where $n$ is a natural number. However, under this condition the transition matrix element vanishes, and thus the mechanism by which photonic resonance (PR) arises has remained unclear. In this work, we aim to elucidate the physical origin of PR observed in KPO spectroscopy. We first performed theoretical calculations and experiments of spectroscopic measurements, confirming that PR can indeed be observed and that the theoretical and experimental results are in qualitative agreement. We then carried out an analytical study under the assumption of an ideal noiseless environment. Our analysis revealed that, although the transition matrix element of the external field expressed in the system's energy eigenbasis is zero, higher-order perturbative effects induce Rabi oscillations between the ground and excited states. Furthermore, numerical simulations in a time domain including the effect of decoherence demonstrated that coherent oscillations decay, leading to the appearance of PR."}

Large numbers of entangled subsystems also require experimentally accessible and practically feasible methods of verifying the genuine, i.e., simultaneous, entanglement of all subsystems. We have derived a class of entanglement witnesses suitable for $W$-states, which are states where a single excitation is coherently distributed across subsystems initially in their ground state or a state with low thermal occupation, e.g., via detection of a Raman-scattered photon. The entanglement is witnessed through violation of an inequality involving number statistics, which can be measured via detection of subsequent Raman-scattered photons. Unlike conventional, partially tomographic, witnesses, our method is experimentally accessible for both multipartite and continuous variable systems. The thermal robustness of the method is quantified by the initial thermal occupations for which violation occurs. As an alternative approach, we have derived an inequality which tests the nonlocal, or quantum coherent, nature of the photon measurement backaction which produces the $W$-state. Violation of this alternative inequality implies the entanglement of the resulting state given the assumption of a separable initial state, under less stringent thermal constraints than the general entanglement witness. Our results are applicable to all Raman-scattering systems which can exhibit sufficient degrees of quantum indistinguishability."}

There were numerous problems this experiment and how it was interpreted. First, the experiment is not observing stationary states as claimed, but rather the time-averaged density of wave pulses which reflect off the potential step. Second, the proposed method for measuring a propagation speed is shown to be invalid for true stationary states. Third, the invalid method was misapplied to the time-averaged density, and this is shown to have created the false impression that it yields correct speed values for stationary states. These issues notwithstanding, for a wavefunction $ψ= Re^{iS/\\hbar}$, the velocity of interest, $\\vec{v}_s = -\\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\frac{\\vec{\\nabla}R}{R}$, is different than the Bohm velocity $\\vec{v}_B=\\frac{1}{m}\\vec{\\nabla}S$, and may be nonzero for stationary states.

Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold. Our results suggest that the utility of quantum computing in machine learning extends beyond potential speedups, offering a robust pathway for building adaptive artificial intelligence and lifelong learners."}

Against this envelope we introduce a minimal constraint enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) that operates directly inside a product one hot subspace and mixes with a block local XY Hamiltonian. For permutation constrained problems, we prove an angle robust, depth matched exponential enhancement where the ratio between the feasible mass from CE QAOA and generic QAOA grows exponentially in $n^2$ for all depths up to a linear fraction of n, under a mild polynomial growth condition on the interaction hypergraph.

Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion.

We derive closed-form expressions for the effective inverse temperature $β_f$ of the postselected system state for both identical and distinct bath temperatures, and identify the control-qubit parameters that maximize heating or cooling. Our analysis reveals how the diagonal and coherent components of the control-qubit state contribute separately to the temperature shift, and how their interplay enables departures from the thermal response attainable under any fixed causal order.

We show that during the propagation of the vortex pairs, analytically obtained in the linear regime, the medium inherits the topology of the vortex pair, mapping the OAM onto a spatially structured atomic coherence. This mapping produces $2|l|-$fold azimuthal transparency structures that reshape the beam intensity from a ring into a petal-like pattern. The OAM-structured atomic coherence induces a corresponding optical anisotropy within the medium, which feeds back into the propagating vector beam, resulting in optical spin-orbit coupling manifested as SAM exchange, rotation, and evolution of polarization textures.

In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied.

Motivated by recent bulk observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in two-dimensional materials and by synthetic realizations in ultracold atoms, we revisit this framework and quantify deviations from the hydrodynamic limit due to lattice effects. Using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we disentangle universal from nonuniversal edge properties. We outline experimental probes in excitonic FCIs and in ultracold atom systems, and in particular propose time-resolved edge spectroscopy to directly access the predicted exponents and velocities."}
