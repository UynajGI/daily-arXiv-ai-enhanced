To address these challenges, this\nstudy introduces a customized Generative Adversarial Network model, STFTSynth,\ndesigned particularly for generating short-time Fourier transform spectrograms\nderived from acoustic event signals.

In practice, however, this assumption is often\nunrealistic in observational studies, as some confounding variables may remain\nunobserved. To address this limitation, sensitivity models for Inverse\nProbability Weighting (IPW) estimators, known as Marginal Sensitivity Models,\nhave been introduced, allowing for a controlled relaxation of ignorability.\nOver the past decades, a substantial body of literature has emerged around\nthese models, aiming to derive sharp and robust bounds for both binary and\ncontinuous treatment effects.

The loss function of\nLp-quantile regression circumvents the non-differentiability of the absolute\nloss function and the difficulty of the squares loss function requiring the\nfiniteness of error's variance and thus promises excellent properties of\nLp-quantile regression. Specifically, we first develop a new method called\ncomposite Lp-quantile regression(CLpQR). We study the oracle model selection\ntheory based on CLpQR (call the estimator CLpQR-oracle) and show in some cases\nof p CLpQR-oracle behaves better than CQR-oracle (based on composite quantile\nregression) when error's variance is infinite. Moreover, CLpQR has high\nefficiency and can be sometimes arbitrarily more efficient than both CQR and\nthe least squares regression. Second, we propose another new regression\nmethod,i.e. near quantile regression and prove the asymptotic normality of the\nestimator when p converges to 1 and the sample size infinity simultaneously. As\nits applications, a new thought of smoothing quantile objective functions and a\nnew estimation are provided for the asymptotic covariance matrix of quantile\nregression.

The framework addresses these limitations through four components:\n(i) a multi-criteria decision-making model that evaluates candidate sites using\nconfigurable spatial factors and adjustable weights, thereby enabling planners\nto represent any combination of planning objectives rather than being limited\nto a fixed set; (ii) network-level metrics that explicitly balance station\nproximity and system-wide accessibility on directed bicycle networks; (iii)\nslope-adjusted distances that account for uphill effort and downhill\nfacilitation; and (iv) a genetic algorithm that generates feasible station sets\nwhile respecting minimum-distance constraints.

This paper investigates various group\nselection strategies in the context of grouping-based self-sustainable\nRIS-aided device-to-device (D2D) communication with spatially correlated\nwireless channels. Specifically, we consider both power splitting (PS) and time\nswitching (TS) configurations, of the self-sustainable RIS to analyze the\nsystem performance and propose appropriate bounds on the choice of system\nparameters. The analysis takes into account a simplified linear energy\nharvesting (EH) model as well as a practical non-linear EH model. Based on the\napplication requirements, we propose various group selection strategies at the\nRIS. Notably, each strategy schedules the k-th best available group at the RIS\nbased on the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and also the energy\nharvested at a particular group of the RIS. Accordingly, by using tools from\nhigh order statistics, we derive analytical expressions for the outage\nprobability of each selection strategy. Moreover, by applying the tools from\nextreme value theory, we also investigate an asymptotic scenario, where the\nnumber of groups available for selection at an RIS approaches infinity.

In particular, the rapid development of data\nscience has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and\nquantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements,\nintegrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief\nintroduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three\ncore aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network\nstructures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will\nprovide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open\nchallenges for future research."}

A key\nfeature of these estimation laws is that they accelerate the convergence of the\nsystem state, $\\mathit{x(t)}$, to the origin. We quantify this improvement by\nshowing that our estimation laws guarantee finite integrability of the\n$\\mathit{r}$-th root of the squared norm of the system state, i.e., \\(\n\\mathit{\\|x(t)\\|}_2^{2/\\mathit{r}} \\in \\mathcal{L}_1, \\) where $\\mathit{r} \\geq\n1$ is a pre-specified parameter that, for a broad class of systems, can be\nchosen arbitrarily large. In contrast, standard Lyapunov-based estimation laws\nonly guarantee integrability of $\\mathit{\\|x(t)\\|}_2^2$ (i.e., $\\mathit{r} =\n1$). We motivate our method by showing that, for large values of $r$, this\nguarantee serves as a sparsity-promoting mechanism in the time domain, meaning\nthat it penalizes prolonged signal duration and slow decay, thereby promoting\nfaster convergence of $\\mathit{x(t)}$. The proposed estimation laws do not rely\non time-varying or high adaptation gains and do not require persistent\nexcitation. Moreover, they can be applied to systems with matched and unmatched\nuncertainties, regardless of their dynamic structure, as long as a control\nLyapunov function (CLF) exists. Finally, they are compatible with any CLF-based\ncertainty equivalence controllers. We further develop higher-order extensions\nof our estimation laws by incorporating momentum into the estimation dynamics.\nWe illustrate the performance improvements achieved with the proposed scheme\nthrough various numerical experiments."}

Although\nmost related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the\npredictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across\ndisciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question:\nWhat are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as\nan important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate\nestimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of\nprediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap\nbetween current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping\nthem determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing\nalgorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the\ndevelopment of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design\nof more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has\nundergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data\nscience has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and\nquantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements,\nintegrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief\nintroduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three\ncore aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network\nstructures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will\nprovide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open\nchallenges for future research."}

While much research has addressed\ndiscretization errors on the left-hand side (LHS) of the Poisson equation, the\nimpact of right-hand-side (RHS) inaccuracies - arising from charge density\nsampling near boundaries in PIC methods - remains largely unexplored. This\nstudy analyzes the numerical errors induced by underestimated RHS values at\nnear-boundary nodes when solving the Poisson equation using embedded boundary\nfinite difference schemes with linear and quadratic treatments. Analytical\nderivations in one dimension and truncation error analyses in two dimensions\nreveal that such RHS inaccuracies modify local truncation behavior differently:\nthey reduce the dominant truncation error in the linear scheme but introduce a\nzeroth-order term in the quadratic scheme, leading to larger global errors.\nNumerical experiments in one-, two-, and three-dimensional domains confirm\nthese findings.

This approach enables solving constrained optimization\nproblems on private data since the operations involved are compatible with the\ncapabilities of homomorphic encryption schemes. To solve the constrained\noptimization problem, a sequence of polynomial penalty functions of increasing\ndegree is introduced, which are sufficiently steep at the boundary of the\nfeasible set. Adding the penalty function to the original cost function creates\na sequence of unconstrained optimization problems whose minimizer always lies\nin the admissible set and converges to the minimizer of the constrained\nproblem. A gradient descent method is used to generate a sequence of iterates\nassociated with these problems. For the algorithm, it is shown that the iterate\nconverges to a minimizer of the original problem, and the feasible set is\npositively invariant under the iteration. Finally, the method is demonstrated\non an illustrative cryptographic problem, finding the smaller value of two\nnumbers, and the encrypted implementability is discussed."}

Prior methods in inverse optimization assume\nthat the true cost is a convex combination of a set of convex basis functions\nand that this basis is consistent with the test points. However, the\nconsistency assumption is not always justified, as in many applications the\nprinciples by which the data is generated are not well understood. This work\nproposes using the distance between a test point and the set of global optima\ngenerated by the convex combinations of the convex basis functions as a\nmeasurement for the expressive quality of the basis with respect to the test\npoint. A large minimal distance invalidates the set of basis functions. The\nconcept of a set of global optima is introduced and its properties are explored\nin unconstrained and constrained settings. Upper and lower bounds for the\nminimum distance in the convex quadratic setting are implemented by bi-level\ngradient descent and an enriched linear matrix inequality respectively.\nExtensions to this framework include max-representable basis functions,\nnonconvex basis functions (local minima), and applying polynomial optimization\ntechniques."}

A common strategy in this context is adaptive\nevaluation, whereby coarse gradients are used in early iterations and refined\nnear a minimizer. This is particularly relevant in differential\nequation-constrained optimization (DECO), where discrete adjoint gradients\ndepend on iterative solvers. Motivated by DECO applications, we propose an\ninexact general descent framework and establish its global convergence theory\nunder two step-size regimes. For bounded step sizes, the analysis assumes that\nthe error tolerance in the computed gradient is proportional to its norm,\nwhereas for diminishing step sizes, the tolerance sequence is required to be\nsummable. The framework is implemented through inexact gradient descent and an\ninexact BFGS-like method, whose performance is demonstrated on a second-order\nODE inverse problem and a two-dimensional Laplace inverse problem using\ndiscrete adjoint gradients with adaptive accuracy. Across these examples,\nadaptive inexact gradients consistently reduced optimization time relative to\nfixed tight tolerances, while incorporating curvature information further\nimproved overall efficiency."}
