Gridded forecasts from classical numerical weather prediction or data-driven models often lack the necessary precision due to unresolved local effects. Typical statistical postprocessing methods correct these biases, but often degrade spatio-temporal correlation structures in doing so. Recent works based on generative modeling successfully improve spatial correlation structures but have to forecast every lead time independently. In contrast, STIPP makes joint spatio-temporal forecasts which have increased accuracy for surface temperature, wind, relative humidity and precipitation when compared to baseline methods. It makes hourly ensemble predictions given only a six-hourly deterministic forecast, blending the boundaries of postprocessing and temporal interpolation. By leveraging a multivariate proper scoring rule for training, STIPP contributes to ongoing work data-driven atmospheric models supervised only with distribution marginals."}

While ground states at integer fillings are typically identified as quantum Hall ferromagnets within a Hartree-Fock framework, we propose the existence of symmetric topological Mott insulators (STMIs) that transcend this Slater determinant picture. Focusing on half-filling of each flavor per unit cell, we demonstrate the existence of STMIs which exhibit a quantized charge or spin Hall response. We first establish this phase in a bilayer Haldane-Hubbard model with localized orbitals on the $A$ sublattice and dispersive band on the $B$ sublattice. Starting from a trivial Mott insulator on the $A$ sublattice, tuning the sublattice potential drives a Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) transition of the associated $p-\\mathrm{i}p$ exciton pairing, realizing a topological Mott insulator with $C=1$ per flavor. We further generalize this construction to a single-layer spinful model, where the resulting STMI hosts charge edge modes coexisting with bulk local moments. A Mott semimetal is identified at the quantum critical point between the STMI and the trivial Mott insulator. Finally, we discuss applications to AA-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$, proposing a ferromagnetic Chern insulator phase as a low-temperature descendant of the symmetric Mott semimetal."}

VSL offers a principled bridge between variational PDE theory, spectral discretization, and contemporary machine learning practice. The core idea is to recast a given PDE \\[ \\mathcal{L}u = f \\quad \\text{in} \\quad Q=Ω\\times(0,T), \\] together with boundary and initial conditions, into differentiable space--time energies built from strong-form least-squares residuals and weak (Galerkin) formulations. The solution is represented as a finite spectral expansion \\[ u_N(x,t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n\\,φ_n(x,t), \\] where $φ_n$ are tensor-product Chebyshev bases in space and time, with Dirichlet-satisfying spatial modes enforcing homogeneous boundary conditions analytically. This yields a compact linear parameterization in the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$, while all PDE complexity is absorbed into the variational energy. We show how to construct strong-form and weak-form space-time functionals, augment them with initial-condition and Tikhonov regularization terms, and minimize the resulting objective with gradient-based optimization. In practice, VSL is implemented in TensorFlow using automatic differentiation and Keras cosine-decay-with-restarts learning-rate schedules, enabling robust optimization of moderately sized coefficient vectors. Numerical experiments on benchmark elliptic and parabolic problems, including one- and two-dimensional Poisson, diffusion, and Burgers-type equations, demonstrate that VSL attains accuracy comparable to classical spectral collocation with Crank-Nicolson time stepping, while providing a differentiable objective suitable for modern optimization tooling."}

However, notwithstanding the rising popularity the two independent proponents of the phenomenon are not equally acknowledged an indication of which is disproportionate number of citations accumulated by Newcomb (1881) and Benford (1938). In the present study use citation analysis to show that the formalization of the eponym Benford's law, a name questionable itself for overlooking Newcomb's contribution, by Raimi (1976) had a strong adverse effect on the future citations of Newcomb (1881). Furthermore, we identify the papers published over various decades of the developmental history of the FD phenomenon, which latter turned out to be amongst the most cited ones in the field. We find that lack of its consideration, intentional or occasionally out of ignorance for referencing by the prominent papers, is responsible for a far lesser number of citations of Newcomb (1881) in comparison to Benford (1938)."}

SDM estimates demonstrate that spillover effects from neighboring provinces frequently exceed the influence of local deprivation, especially for living-condition, health-access, accessibility, and poor-household indicators. These patterns are consistent with contagion and contextual influence processes well established in social network theory.\n  By framing morbidity and poverty as interdependent attributes on a spatial network, this study contributes to the growing literature on structural diffusion, health inequality, and regional vulnerability. The results highlight the importance of coordinated policy interventions across provincial boundaries and demonstrate how network-based modeling can uncover the spatial dynamics of health and deprivation."}

Theory predicts that slow, deterministic modulation of the drive amplitude or frequency can lead to a peculiar synchronization regime characterized by intermittent locking of the oscillation phase beyond the Arnold-tongue boundaries associated with fixed harmonic forcing. We test these predictions in a controllable aeroacoustic self oscillator, i.e, a whistle, that exhibits a robust limit cycle and is subject to external acoustic forcing with programmable frequency and amplitude modulation. Under both slowly varying frequency or amplitude of the forcing, three regimes are observed: (i) strict synchronization (ii) intermittent synchronization, characterized by alternating phase locking and brief phase slip episodes and (iii) no synchronization, with regular phase slips. Particularly in strict synchronization regime, the phase of the oscillator will follow arbitrary slowly-varying drive phase and under amplitude modulation its amplitude fluctuations are strongly suppressed."}

(ii) Develop a nonparametric minimax theory for robust model selection between sparse Erdos-Renyi and block models, showing-via robustness error exponents-that no Bayesian or frequentist method can uniformly improve upon the decision-theoretic limits over configuration models and sparse graphon classes for percolation-type functionals.

A key result is that the number of required bases is provably small: K=1 suffices in one-dimensional continua (and on lattices in any dimension), K=2 suffices in two dimensions, and in higher dimensions K grows at most linearly with particle number. The antisymmetric bases can be learned by small neural networks, while the symmetric factors are implemented by permutation-invariant networks whose width scales only linearly with particle number.

This paper presents a system dynamics (SD) modeling framework for analyzing policy and resource dynamics within the construction sector in Sudan, with broader applicability to Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The model incorporates key variables related to workforce, material supply, financing, and policy delays, and is calibrated using genetic algorithms (GAs) based on sectoral data and expert input. Simulation results across four policy scenarios indicate that regulatory reform and workforce training are the most effective levers for improving project performance. Specifically, implementing streamlined regulatory procedures reduced project delays by up to 32%, while investment in human capital decreased cost overruns by 28% over a 10-year simulation horizon. In contrast, scenarios focusing solely on material supply or financial inputs produced limited gains without corresponding policy or labor improvements. Sensitivity analysis further revealed that the system is highly responsive to macroeconomic stability and public investment flows. The study demonstrates that a hybrid SD-GA modeling approach offers a valuable decision-support tool for policymakers seeking to improve infrastructure delivery under uncertainty. Recommendations include phased regulatory reforms, targeted capacity building, and integrating modeling tools into strategic infrastructure planning in LDCs."}

At the CRN level, some of these systems have 4 reactions of which only 3 are quadratic, or 5 reactions with only 2 being quadratic. These results quantify structural complexity of chaotic CDSs, and indicate that they are ubiquitous."}

The stochastic block model (SBM) explains such structure by positing a latent partition of nodes and block-specific edge distributions. In Bayesian SBMs, standard MCMC alternates between updating the partition and sampling block parameters, which can hinder mixing and complicate principled comparison across different partitions and numbers of communities. We develop a collapsed Bayesian SBM framework in which block-specific nuisance parameters are analytically integrated out under conjugate priors, so the marginal likelihood p(Y|z) depends only on the partition z and blockwise sufficient statistics. This yields fast local Gibbs/Metropolis updates based on ratios of closed-form integrated likelihoods and provides evidence-based complexity control that discourages gratuitous over-partitioning. We derive exact collapsed marginals for the most common SBM edge types-Beta-Bernoulli (binary), Gamma-Poisson (counts), and Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Gaussian weights)-and we extend collapsing to gap-constrained SBMs via truncated conjugate priors that enforce explicit upper bounds on between-community connectivity. We further show that the same collapsed strategy supports directed SBMs that model reciprocity through dyad states, signed SBMs via categorical block models, and multiplex SBMs where multiple layers contribute additive evidence for a shared partition. Across synthetic benchmarks and real networks (including email communication, hospital contact counts, and citation graphs), collapsed inference produces accurate partitions and interpretable posterior block summaries of within- and between-community interaction strengths while remaining computationally simple and modular."}

Ho-based pyrochlores host a dipolar spin-ice ground state, characterized by Ising moments constrained by the ice rules and elementary excitations analogous to magnetic monopoles. Here we examine how controlled chemical disorder influences this state by introducing site mixing on the non-magnetic $B$-site in two compounds. Ho$_2$GaSbO$_7$ contains only Ga$^{3+}$/Sb$^{5+}$ charge disorder, whereas Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$ exhibits both charge and substantial size disorder arising from the large ionic-radius mismatch between Sc$^{3+}$ and Sb$^{5+}$. Although both materials retain the pyrochlore structure, neutron scattering measurements reveal a reduced correlation length for the $R/B$-site cation ordering and enhanced local structural distortions in Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$. Despite these structural differences, bulk thermodynamic measurements and magnetic diffuse scattering demonstrate that both systems exhibit the defining signatures of a dipolar spin-ice state. Low-energy inelastic neutron spectroscopy further uncovers broad magnetic excitations that develop within the dipolar spin-ice regime, a feature absent in pristine Ho pyrochlores and indicative of disorder-induced splitting of the non-Kramers ground-state doublet. Together, these results show that controlled disorder generates tunable transverse-field-driven quantum fluctuations in Ho-based pyrochlores, although the dipolar spin-ice state is remarkably robust to this disorder."}

This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT.

Our procedure rejects the composite null hypothesis $H_0: θ\\in Θ_0$ if the simple null hypothesis $H_0: θ= θ_t$ is rejected for every $θ_t$ in the null region $Θ_0$, using an inflated significance level. We derive formulas that determine this inflated level so that the overall test approximately maintains the desired significance level even with small samples. Whereas the traditional likelihood ratio test applies when the null region is defined solely by equality constraints--that is, when it forms a manifold without boundary--the proposed approach extends to null hypotheses defined by both equality and inequality constraints. In addition, it accommodates null hypotheses expressed as unions of several component regions and can be applied to models involving nuisance parameters. Through several examples featuring nonstandard composite null hypotheses, we demonstrate numerically that the proposed test achieves accurate inference, exhibiting only a small gap between the actual and nominal significance levels for both small and large samples."}

The classical hyperbolic system is regularized by a third-order dispersive term in the momentum equation, which renders the system equivalent, via the Madelung transform, to a defocusing cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a drift term induced by bottom topography.\n  Instead of solving the shallow water equations directly, we solve the associated Schrödinger equation and recover the hydrodynamic variables through a simple postprocessing procedure. This approach transforms the original nonlinear hyperbolic system into a semilinear complex-valued equation, which can be efficiently approximated using a Strang time-splitting method combined with a spectral element discretization in space.\n  Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in subcritical regimes without shock formation, the Schrödinger regularization provides an $O(\\varepsilon)$ approximation to the classical shallow water solution, where $\\varepsilon$ denotes the regularization parameter. Importantly, we observe that this convergence behavior persists even in the presence of moving wetting--drying interfaces, where vacuum states emerge and standard shallow water solvers often encounter difficulties. These results suggest that the Schrödinger-based formulation offers a robust and promising alternative framework for the numerical simulation of shallow water flows with dry states."}

We analyze a memory-assisted quantum clock interferometer in which a frequency-bin photonic clock is stored in two vertically separated quantum memories for a controllable duration, such that the joint state evolves in a quantum superposition of two proper times. After retrieval, the photonic modes interfere in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, for which we derive analytic expressions for the resulting multiphoton detection statistics. Extending this HOM-based scheme from entangled photon pairs to frequency-entangled 2N-photon inputs, we show that the proper-time dependent phase is amplified by a factor N, leading to an N-times faster collapse and revival of the interference signal compared with the two-photon case. Incorporating finite memory efficiency and lifetime, we identify regimes where this modulation remains observable. For parameters compatible with demonstrated Rb and Cs memories and achievable optical frequency separations, the first collapse occurs for height differences in the order of 10-100 m with subsecond to few-second storage times, while suitable rare-earth ion and alkali memory combinations can reduce the required height to the few-metre scale.

Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations.

Simulation results demonstrate that pole-placement-based controllers are highly sensitive to disturbances, whereas LQR-based controllers offer improved robustness at the expense of slower dynamics.

It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources.\n  This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition."}

We develop a fully quantitative, probabilistic graph-regularized inference model that integrates both gravity and receiver function (RF) constraints and evaluate its ability to determine the basin's shape. The sediment-basement interface in single-station RFs is often difficult to interpret due to scattering and noise, which can render isolated stations unusable. By using RFs from a dense seismic array and incorporating gravity, we address the issue of non-uniqueness in converting the times of RF phases to layer thickness by comparing the predicted gravity to observations at each station. In areas where the density contrast may change, Bayesian inference with a graph Laplacian allows us to determine the effective density contrast by taking into account its neighbors' picks and densities. This method promotes spatial smoothness between neighboring stations, while preserving sharp contrasts in locations supported by the RF and gravity data. We applied this method to a dataset that was acquired in fall 2023, when 140 nodes were installed in the SFV. Our results show the deep Sylmar sub-basin, the San Fernando sub-basin, and the Leadwell high found in a previous study (Juárez-Zúñiga and Persaud, 2025), and our results also show good agreement with the industry seismic reflection profiles across the valley. This method demonstrates how to incorporate gravity with lateral density variations into receiver function interpretation to better map interfaces in the subsurface."}

Here, we report the growth of single crystalline quasi-two-dimensional van-der-Waals-like Kondo lattice CeSn$_{0.75}$Sb$_2$, and its physical properties by a combination of transport / magnetic / thermodynamic measurements. We find that it hosts a fragile antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and a cluster glass (CG) ground state, both of which are highly sensitive to external fields. Upon cooling under low in-plane magnetic fields, the AFM phase evolves into a polarized paramagnetic phase, either directly or indirectly through the intermediate CG phase. This process constitutes an inverse magnetic melting effect that restores the broken translational / rotational symmetries. Our work provides a rare paradigm of inverse magnetic melting effect in vdW-like heavy-fermion materials, and enriches the physics in conventional Kondo-lattice models."}

We introduce the new concept of ``Multi-Valued Input Fixed Polarity Reed-Muller (MVI-RM)\" forms.

Using decoders decreases the number of input qubits in these Toffoli gates.

The best MVI-FPRM forms are factorized and reduced to approximate Multi-Valued Input Generalized Reed-Muller (MVI-GRM) forms."}

In the context of spin systems, it represents the population of the sublevels of the magnetization in the $z$-direction. We use this quantity to probe the onset of thermalization in the isolated quantum and classical one-dimensional spin-1 Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields. Thermalization is achieved when the long-time average of the occupation number converges to the microcanonical prediction as the chain length $L$ increases, consistent with the emergence of ergodicity. However, the finite-size scaling analysis in the quantum model is challenged by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with $L$. To overcome this limitation, we turn to the corresponding classical model, which enables access to much larger system sizes. By tracking the dynamics of individual spins on their three-dimensional Bloch spheres and employing tools from random matrix theory, we establish a quantitative criterion for classical ergodicity in interacting spin systems. We find that deviations from classical ergodicity decay algebraically with system size. This power-law scaling then provides a quantitative bound on the approach to thermal equilibrium in the quantum model."}

With the rise of artificial intelligence, data-driven gravity inversion methods based on deep learning (DL) possess physical property recovery capabilities that conventional regularization methods lack. However, existing DL methods suffer from insufficient prior information constraints, which leads to inversion models with large data fitting errors and unreliable results. Moreover, the inversion results lack constraints and matching from other exploration methods, leading to results that may contradict known geological conditions. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates prior density well logging information to address the above issues. First, we introduce a depth weighting function to the neural network (NN) and train it in the weighted density parameter domain. The NN, under the constraint of the weighted forward operator, demonstrates improved inversion performance, with the resulting inversion model exhibiting smaller data fitting errors. Next, we divide the entire network training into two phases: first training a large pre-trained network Net-I, and then using the density logging information as the constraint to get the optimized fine-tuning network Net-II. Through testing and comparison in synthetic models and Bishop Model, the inversion quality of our method has significantly improved compared to the unconstrained data-driven DL inversion method. Additionally, we also conduct a comparison and discussion between our method and both the conventional focusing inversion (FI) method and its well logging constrained variant. Finally, we apply this method to the measured data from the San Nicolas mining area in Mexico, comparing and analyzing it with two recent gravity inversion methods based on DL."}

Our procedure rejects the composite null hypothesis $H_0: θ\\in Θ_0$ if the simple null hypothesis $H_0: θ= θ_t$ is rejected for every $θ_t$ in the null region $Θ_0$, using an inflated significance level. We derive formulas that determine this inflated level so that the overall test approximately maintains the desired significance level even with small samples. Whereas the traditional likelihood ratio test applies when the null region is defined solely by equality constraints--that is, when it forms a manifold without boundary--the proposed approach extends to null hypotheses defined by both equality and inequality constraints. In addition, it accommodates null hypotheses expressed as unions of several component regions and can be applied to models involving nuisance parameters. Through several examples featuring nonstandard composite null hypotheses, we demonstrate numerically that the proposed test achieves accurate inference, exhibiting only a small gap between the actual and nominal significance levels for both small and large samples."}

We show through numerical simulations that the new method resolves finer spectral features, while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional approaches to noise spectroscopy. Second, we simplify the experimental implementation of the method, by introducing Rademacher measurements for reconstructing sparse noise spectra.

Rather than producing isolated outputs, such systems operate continuously under feedback, adaptation, and scale, reshaping physical flows, human behavior, and institutional practice over time. In these settings, socially unacceptable outcomes rarely arise from singular faults or explicit policy violations. Instead, they emerge through cumulative execution trajectories enabled by repetition, concurrency, and feedback.\n  This paper advances the formal foundation of the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS) by making its central requirement explicit: responsibility is fundamentally a reachability property of system execution. A system is responsible iff its execution semantics prevent entry into inadmissible global configurations, regardless of local performance gains or optimization objectives. Responsibility failures are therefore not objective-level errors, but execution-level failures of trajectory control.\n  To operationalize this perspective, we introduce Petri nets as an execution-level formalism for responsible autonomous systems. We show how SRS value commitments correspond to forbidden markings, safeguards to structural constraints on transition firing, auditing to monitoring of reachability pressure, and governance to legitimate modification of execution structure. Embedding Petri-net reachability within the SRS architecture internalizes responsibility as a structural invariant rather than an external objective or post-hoc mechanism.\n  These results establish the Social Responsibility Stack as an executable responsibility architecture and position reachability-based execution semantics as a necessary foundation for responsible autonomy in feedback-rich cyber-physical and socio-technical systems."}

We introduce annotation-informed knockoffs (AnnoKn), a knockoff-based method that performs annotation-informed variable selection with strict control of the false discovery rate. AnnoKn integrates the knockoff procedure with adaptive Lasso regression to evaluate the importance of multiple covariates while incorporating functional annotation information within a unified Bayesian framework. To facilitate real-world applications where individual-level data are not accessible, we further extend AnnoKn to operate on summary statistics. Through simulations and real-world applications to GTEx and GWAS datasets, we show that AnnoKn achieves superior power in detecting causal genetic variants compared with existing annotation-informed variable selection methods, while maintaining valid control over false discoveries."}

Such training can occupy entire data centers for weeks and requires enormous computational and energy resources. Yet the optimization algorithms behind these runs have not kept pace. Most large scale training still relies on synchronous methods, where workers must wait for the slowest device, wasting compute and amplifying the effects of hardware and network variability. Removing synchronization seems like a simple fix, but asynchrony introduces staleness, meaning updates computed on outdated models. This makes analysis difficult, especially when delays arise from system level randomness rather than algorithmic choices. As a result, the time complexity of asynchronous methods remains poorly understood. This dissertation develops a rigorous framework for asynchronous first order stochastic optimization, focusing on the core challenge of heterogeneous worker speeds. Within this framework, we show that with proper design, asynchronous SGD can achieve optimal time complexity, matching guarantees previously known only for synchronous methods. Our first contribution, Ringmaster ASGD, attains optimal time complexity in the homogeneous data setting by selectively discarding stale updates. The second, Ringleader ASGD, extends optimality to heterogeneous data, common in federated learning, using a structured gradient table mechanism. Finally, ATA improves resource efficiency by learning worker compute time distributions and allocating tasks adaptively, achieving near optimal wall clock time with less computation. Together, these results establish asynchronous optimization as a theoretically sound and practically efficient foundation for distributed learning, showing that coordination without synchronization can be both feasible and optimal."}

This interaction enables a nontrivial interplay between topology and nonlinear dynamics in soliton pumping. In the weakly interacting regime, the ground-state soliton undergoes quantized Thouless pumping. At intermediate interaction strengths, soliton creation and annihilation break adiabaticity and disrupt quantized transport. In the strong-coupling regime, the coexistence of ground- and excited-state solitons leads to negligible coupling at energy crossings, giving rise to discrete time-translation symmetry breaking (DTTSB) in the soliton dynamics. Comparison of mean-field results with exact diagonalization along closed circular pumping paths confirms both the validity of the mean-field description and the robustness of DTTSB across different pumping trajectories.

At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling."}

This issue is solved therein by the support line (SL) correction, which is proven to control the boundary false discovery rate (bFDR) in the independent, non-conformal setting.

However, past work in deriving key-rate bounds for this protocol with CAD have assumed a trivial bound on the quantum entropy, whenever Alice sends a vacuum state in a CAD block (i.e., the entropy of such blocks is taken to be zero). Since such rounds contribute, negatively, to the error correction leakage, this results in a correct, though sub-optimal bound. Here, we derive a new proof of security for CAD applied to the decoy state BB84 protocol, computing a bound on Eve's uncertainty in all possible single and vacuum photon events. We use this to derive a new asymptotic key-rate bound which, we show, outperforms prior work, allowing for increased distances and noise tolerances."}

To address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Preemptive Holistic Collaborative (Prollect) framework, which generalizes the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System (PHCS) by decomposing the global coordination problem into topologically connected subspace optimizations. We formalize the system as a Hybrid Automaton and introduce a three-stage receding horizon mechanism (frozen execution, preliminary planning, proactive look-ahead windows) with explicit padding to prevent races between coordination dissemination and intent updates. Notably, we design a robust timing protocol with a mandatory Idle Buffer that acts as a dwell-time constraint to eliminate Zeno behaviors and ensure computational stability under jitter.

The core idea is to define a fitted distribution using a sliced Wasserstein barycenter (SWB) of push-forwards of the predictors and to quantify deviations from the observed response using the sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. Regression functions, which map predictors' supports to the response support, and barycenter weights are inferred within a generalized Bayes framework, enabling principled uncertainty quantification without requiring a fully specified likelihood. The inference process can be seen as an instance of an inverse SWB problem. We establish theoretical guarantees, including the stability of the SWB under perturbations of marginals and barycenter weights, sample complexity of the generalized likelihood, and posterior consistency. For practical inference, we introduce a differentiable approximation of the SWB and a smooth reparameterization to handle the simplex constraint on barycenter weights, allowing efficient gradient-based MCMC sampling. We demonstrate MDDR in an application to inference for population-scale single-cell data. Posterior analysis under the MDDR model in this example includes inference on communication between multiple source/sender cell types and a target/receiver cell type.

Rather than producing isolated outputs, such systems operate continuously under feedback, adaptation, and scale, reshaping physical flows, human behavior, and institutional practice over time. In these settings, socially unacceptable outcomes rarely arise from singular faults or explicit policy violations. Instead, they emerge through cumulative execution trajectories enabled by repetition, concurrency, and feedback.\n  This paper advances the formal foundation of the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS) by making its central requirement explicit: responsibility is fundamentally a reachability property of system execution. A system is responsible iff its execution semantics prevent entry into inadmissible global configurations, regardless of local performance gains or optimization objectives. Responsibility failures are therefore not objective-level errors, but execution-level failures of trajectory control.\n  To operationalize this perspective, we introduce Petri nets as an execution-level formalism for responsible autonomous systems. We show how SRS value commitments correspond to forbidden markings, safeguards to structural constraints on transition firing, auditing to monitoring of reachability pressure, and governance to legitimate modification of execution structure. Embedding Petri-net reachability within the SRS architecture internalizes responsibility as a structural invariant rather than an external objective or post-hoc mechanism.\n  These results establish the Social Responsibility Stack as an executable responsibility architecture and position reachability-based execution semantics as a necessary foundation for responsible autonomy in feedback-rich cyber-physical and socio-technical systems."}

This Floquet Hamiltonian contains explicit time-reversal symmetry breaking terms that are absent if conduction bands are neglected from the beginning of the derivation. Based on the Floquet Hamiltonian, we find the increasing of CPL driving intensity can cause the crossing of Floquet bands between the two valleys.

PFEM consists of a physics informed pretraining stage and an optional finetuning stage.

The model operates directly on unstructured point clouds, jointly encoding geometric information, material properties, and boundary conditions, and produces physically consistent initial solutions with extremely high computational efficiency. PDE constraints are enforced through explicit finite element, based differentiation, avoiding the overhead associated with automatic differentiation. In the fine-tuning stage, the pretrained prediction is used as an initial guess for conventional FEM solvers, preserving their accuracy, convergence guarantees, and extrapolation capability while substantially reducing the number of iterations required to reach a prescribed tolerance. PFEM is validated on a broad range of benchmark problems, including linear elasticity and nonlinear hyperelasticity with complex geometries, heterogeneous materials, and arbitrary boundary conditions.

To characterize the uncertainty computing resources at different mining participants, we establish an ambiguous set representing uncertainty of resource distributions. Then, the networked mining is formulated as a non-cooperative game, where distributionally robust performance is calculated for each individual miner to tackle the resource uncertainties. We prove the existence of the equilibrium of the distributionally robust mining game. To derive the equilibrium, we propose the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)-based reinterpretation of the best response of each miner. We then solve the individual strategy with alternating optimization, which facilitates the iteration among miners towards the game equilibrium. Furthermore, we consider the case that the ambiguity of resource distribution reduces to Gaussian distribution and the case that another uncertainties vanish, and then characterize the properties of the equilibrium therein along with a distributed algorithm to achieve the equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches effectively converge to the equilibrium, and effectively tackle the uncertainties in blockchain mining to achieve a robust performance guarantee."}

Cluster-specific weights rebalance the classical FCM criterion so that smaller clusters are not overwhelmed by dominant groups, and the weighted objective induces a normalized density model with scale parameter $σ$ and fuzziness parameter $m$.

Focusing on schemes using continuous piecewise-polynomial trial functions in time, we analyze their stability, convergence, and geometric properties. We consider first a weak space-time formulation with test functions projected onto discontinuous polynomials of one degree lower in time, showing that it is equivalent to the scheme proposed in [French, Peterson 1996] in the linear case, and extended in [Karakashian, Makridakis 2005] to the semilinear case. In particular, this equivalence shows that this method conserves energy at mesh nodes but is not symplectic. We then introduce two symplectic variants, obtained through Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Lobatto quadratures in time, and show that they correspond to specific Runge-Kutta time integrators. These connections clarify the geometric structure of the space-time methods considered."}

In this paper, we investigate the multiparameter estimation for a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a vacuum scalar field in both bounded and unbounded Minkowski vacuum. Our analysis reveals that quantum Cramér-Rao bound fails to provide a tight error bound for the two-parameter estimation involving the initial phase and weight parameters. For this reason, we numerically compute two tighter error bounds, Holevo Cramér-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, based on a semidefinite program. Notably, our results demonstrate that Nagaoka bound yields the tightest error bound among all the considered error bounds, consistent with the general hierarchy of multiparameter quantum estimation. In the case with a boundary, we observe the introduction of boundary systematically reduces the values of both Holevo Cramér-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, indicating an improvement on the attainable estimation precision.

Here we take a transformation-based approach and experimentally examine transitions between nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Using an optically trapped microparticle driven by a tunable correlated stochastic force, we generate active-like steady states with controllable noise statistics. By abruptly changing the trap stiffness, we measure the stochastic work, heat, and entropy produced during NESS-to-NESS transformations. We identify a state-dependent effective temperature that restores the second law for these transitions, enabling the definition of a generalized work that incorporates the consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. With this quantity, we derive and experimentally verify a Crooks-like fluctuation relation linking work distributions to a nonequilibrium free-energy difference defined through the effective temperature. Finally, we establish a fluctuation-response relation for the positional variance following stiffness changes. We demonstrate that this relation is key to distinguishing systems that can be described by a unique effective temperature (i.e., those under equilibrium or white-noise conditions) from those under colored-noise, where an equilibrium-like response cannot be restored. These results delineate the applicability and limits of effective-temperature thermodynamics in driven systems."}

Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between them and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism has been debated. Although we have already proposed a physical \"agent determinism\" model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, a sequence of indices that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans."}

Numerous studies have thus evaluated the reliability of their findings by comparing ICCs, however, they often failed to test statistical differences between ICCs or report confidence intervals. Relying solely on point estimates may preclude valid inference about population-level differences and compromise the reliability of conclusions. To address this issue, this study systematically reviewed the use of ICC in articles published in NeuroImage from 2022 to 2024, highlighting the prevalence of misreporting and misuse of ICCs. We further provide practical guidelines for conducting appropriate statistical inference on ICCs. For practitioners in this area, we introduce an online application for statistical testing and sample size estimation when utilizing ICCs. We recalculated confidence intervals and formally tested ICC values reported in the reviewed articles, thereby reassessing the original inferences. Our results demonstrate that exclusive reliance on point estimates could lead to unreliable or even misleading conclusions. Specifically, only two of the eleven reviewed articles provided unequivocally valid statistical inferences based on ICCs, whereas two articles failed to yield any valid inference at all, raising serious concerns about the replicability of findings in this field.

When considering, for example, routing problems for cyclists, the safety of a street can be ranked in ordered categories like safe (separate bike lane), medium safe (street with a bike lane) and unsafe (street without a bike lane). However, ordinal optimization may suggest unrealistic solutions with huge detours to avoid unsafe street segments. In this paper, we investigate how partial preference information regarding the relative quality of the ordinal categories can be used to improve the relevance of the computed solutions. By introducing preference weights which describe how much better a category is at least or at most, compared to the subsequent category, we enlarge the ordinal dominance cone. This leads to a smaller set of alternatives, i. e., of ordinally efficient solutions. We show that the corresponding weighted ordinal ordering cone is a polyhedral cone and provide descriptions via its extreme rays and via its facets. The latter implies a linear transformation to an associated multi-objective optimization problem. This paves the way for the application of standard multi-objective solution approaches. We demonstrate the usefulness of the weighted ordinal ordering cone by investigating a safest path problem with different preference weights. Moreover, we investigate the interrelation between the weighted ordering cone to standard dominance concepts of multi-objective optimization, like, e.g., Pareto dominance, lexicographic dominance and weighted sum dominance."}

To address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Preemptive Holistic Collaborative (Prollect) framework, which generalizes the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System (PHCS) by decomposing the global coordination problem into topologically connected subspace optimizations. We formalize the system as a Hybrid Automaton and introduce a three-stage receding horizon mechanism (frozen execution, preliminary planning, proactive look-ahead windows) with explicit padding to prevent races between coordination dissemination and intent updates. Notably, we design a robust timing protocol with a mandatory Idle Buffer that acts as a dwell-time constraint to eliminate Zeno behaviors and ensure computational stability under jitter.

In this paper, we examine measurement using the Q-based, objective-field model for quantum mechanics. Schrodinger considered a microscopic system prepared in a superposition of states which is then coupled to a macroscopic meter. We analyze the entangled meter and system, and measurements on it, by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations for real amplitudes $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ that correspond to the phase-space variables of the Q function of the system at a time $t$. We model the system and meter as single-mode fields, and measurement of $\\hat{x}$ by amplification of the amplitude $x(t)$. Our conclusion is that the outcome for the measurement is determined at (or by) the time $t_{m}$, when the coupling to the meter is complete, the meter states being macroscopically distinguishable. There is consistency with macroscopic realism. By evaluating the distribution of the amplitudes $x$ and $p$ postselected on a given outcome of the meter, we show how the $Q$-based model represents a more complete description of quantum mechanics: The variances associated with amplitudes $x$ and $p$ are too narrow to comply with the uncertainty principle, ruling out that the distribution represents a quantum state. We conclude that the collapse of the wavefunction occurs as a two-stage process: First there is an amplification that creates branches of amplitudes $x(t)$ of the meter, associated with distinct eigenvalues. The outcome of measurement is determined by $x(t)$ once amplified, explaining Born's rule. Second, the distribution that determines the final collapse is the state inferred for the system conditioned on the outcome of the meter: information is lost about the meter, in particular, about the complementary variable $p$."}

Quantile regression (QR) not only offers a flexible way to capture heterogeneous effects across the conditional distribution of an outcome, but also naturally produces prediction intervals that help quantify uncertainty in future predictions. However, classical QR methods can face serious memory and computational constraints in large-scale settings. These limitations motivate the use of parallel computing to maintain tractability. While extensive work has examined sample-splitting strategies in settings where the number of observations $n$ greatly exceeds the number of features $p$, the equally important (ultra) high-dimensional regime ($p >> n$) has been comparatively underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a feature-splitting proximal point algorithm, FS-QRPPA, for penalized QR in high-dimensional regime. Leveraging recent developments in variational analysis, we establish a Q-linear convergence rate for FS-QRPPA and demonstrate its superior scalability in large-scale genomic applications from the UK Biobank relative to existing methods. Moreover, FS-QRPPA yields more accurate coefficient estimates and better coverage for prediction intervals than current approaches.

To characterize the uncertainty computing resources at different mining participants, we establish an ambiguous set representing uncertainty of resource distributions. Then, the networked mining is formulated as a non-cooperative game, where distributionally robust performance is calculated for each individual miner to tackle the resource uncertainties. We prove the existence of the equilibrium of the distributionally robust mining game. To derive the equilibrium, we propose the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)-based reinterpretation of the best response of each miner. We then solve the individual strategy with alternating optimization, which facilitates the iteration among miners towards the game equilibrium. Furthermore, we consider the case that the ambiguity of resource distribution reduces to Gaussian distribution and the case that another uncertainties vanish, and then characterize the properties of the equilibrium therein along with a distributed algorithm to achieve the equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches effectively converge to the equilibrium, and effectively tackle the uncertainties in blockchain mining to achieve a robust performance guarantee."}

Existing restoration approaches typically assume full awareness of damage, which may not be true if monitoring and communication infrastructures are impaired. In such circumstances, field inspection is necessary. This paper presents a novel adaptive restoration framework for IEGDS, considering dynamic damage assessment and repair. The restoration problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the gradually revealed contingency and the evolving impact of field crew actions. To address the computational challenges of POMDPs in real-time applications, an advanced belief tree search (BTS) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm enables crew members to continuously update their actions based on evolving belief states, leveraging comprehensive simulations to evaluate potential future trajectories and identify optimal inspection and repair strategies. Based on the BTS algorithm, a unified real-time decision-making framework is developed for IEGDS restoration.

To address this issue, we extend results from classical group sequential design theory to sequential Bayes factor designs. The key idea is to derive Bayes factor stopping regions in terms of the z-statistic and use the known distribution of the cumulative z-statistics to compute stopping probabilities through multivariate normal integration. The resulting method is fast, accurate, and simulation-free. We illustrate it with examples from clinical trials, animal experiments, and psychological studies.

Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between them and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism has been debated. Although we have already proposed a physical \"agent determinism\" model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, a sequence of indices that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans."}

Here we show that a nontrivial fixed point generically does exist in the $\\textit{complex}$ coupling plane and is described by a complex conformal field theory (CCFT). This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT. Since the CCFT vacuum is the eigenstate with the smallest decay rate, the system naturally relaxes under dissipative dynamics toward a CFT state, thus providing a route to preparing long-range entangled states through engineered dissipation."}

Starting from a one-dimensional interaction $V(x) = -g^2 e^{-αm x}/x$, we reformulate the problem in terms of a four-dimensional radial oscillator, where the finite screening length generates a systematic hierarchy of polynomial interactions in the radial coordinate. This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $ρ^4$, which appears at order $α^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We show that the entropy receives analytic corrections at order $α^2$, originating both from explicit anharmonic state-mixing effects and from the implicit $α$ dependence of the Gaussian width parameter. Our results clarify the distinct roles of harmonic renormalization and genuinely non-Gaussian interactions in generating entanglement, establish a systematic power-counting and normalization scheme for higher-order $ρ^{2n}$ perturbations, and provide a transparent oscillator-based framework for computing entanglement entropy in weakly interacting low-dimensional and field-theoretic systems."}

For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients.

Similarly, in a Bell test using any given Bell inequality, the maximum violation achievable using quantum strategies respecting or disregarding a certain symmetry can be different. In this work, we focus on the symmetry involved in the exchange of parties and explore when we have to trade this symmetry for a lower-dimensional quantum strategy in achieving the maximal violation of given Bell inequalities. For the family of symmetric Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequalities, we provide evidence showing that there is no such trade-off. However, for several other Bell inequalities with a small number of dichotomic measurement settings, we show that symmetric quantum strategies in the minimal Hilbert space dimension can only lead to a suboptimal Bell violation. In other words, there exist symmetric Bell inequalities that can only be maximally violated by asymmetric quantum strategies of minimal dimension. In contrast, one can also find examples of asymmetric Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by symmetric correlations. The implications of these findings on the geometry of the set of quantum correlations and the possibility of performing self-testing therefrom are briefly discussed."}

While cell-level inconsistencies provide early warning signals of degradation and safety risks, the lack of scalable and interpretable decision-support frameworks prevents these signals from being effectively translated into operational actions. Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices. These results establish a scalable pathway for intelligent operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems, with direct implications for reliability, safety, and cost-effective integration of energy storage into modern power systems."}

Existing restoration approaches typically assume full awareness of damage, which may not be true if monitoring and communication infrastructures are impaired. In such circumstances, field inspection is necessary. This paper presents a novel adaptive restoration framework for IEGDS, considering dynamic damage assessment and repair. The restoration problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the gradually revealed contingency and the evolving impact of field crew actions. To address the computational challenges of POMDPs in real-time applications, an advanced belief tree search (BTS) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm enables crew members to continuously update their actions based on evolving belief states, leveraging comprehensive simulations to evaluate potential future trajectories and identify optimal inspection and repair strategies. Based on the BTS algorithm, a unified real-time decision-making framework is developed for IEGDS restoration. Case studies on two distinct IEGDS systems demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieves an outage cost comparable to the ideal solution, and reduces the total outage cost by more than 15% compared to strategies based on stochastic programming and heuristic methods."}

The stochastic block model (SBM) explains such structure by positing a latent partition of nodes and block-specific edge distributions. In Bayesian SBMs, standard MCMC alternates between updating the partition and sampling block parameters, which can hinder mixing and complicate principled comparison across different partitions and numbers of communities. We develop a collapsed Bayesian SBM framework in which block-specific nuisance parameters are analytically integrated out under conjugate priors, so the marginal likelihood p(Y|z) depends only on the partition z and blockwise sufficient statistics. This yields fast local Gibbs/Metropolis updates based on ratios of closed-form integrated likelihoods and provides evidence-based complexity control that discourages gratuitous over-partitioning. We derive exact collapsed marginals for the most common SBM edge types-Beta-Bernoulli (binary), Gamma-Poisson (counts), and Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Gaussian weights)-and we extend collapsing to gap-constrained SBMs via truncated conjugate priors that enforce explicit upper bounds on between-community connectivity. We further show that the same collapsed strategy supports directed SBMs that model reciprocity through dyad states, signed SBMs via categorical block models, and multiplex SBMs where multiple layers contribute additive evidence for a shared partition. Across synthetic benchmarks and real networks (including email communication, hospital contact counts, and citation graphs), collapsed inference produces accurate partitions and interpretable posterior block summaries of within- and between-community interaction strengths while remaining computationally simple and modular."}

A critical step in this multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process is the determination of appropriate criteria weights. However, deriving these weights often solely involves either subjective assessment from decision-makers or objective weighting methods, each of which has limitations in terms of cognitive burden, potential bias, and insufficient contextual relevance. This study proposes the subjective-objective median-based importance technique (SOMIT), a novel hybrid approach for determining criteria weights in MCDM. By tailoring SOMIT to renewable energy evaluation, the method directly supports applied energy system planning, policy analysis, and technology prioritization under carbon neutrality goals. The practical utility of SOMIT is demonstrated through two MCDM case studies on renewable energy decision-making in India and Saudi Arabia. Using the derived weights from SOMIT, the TOPSIS method ranks the renewable energy alternatives, with solar power achieving the highest performance scores in both cases. The main contributions of this work are five-fold: 1) the proposed SOMIT reduces the number of required subjective comparisons from the conventional quadratic order to a linear order; 2) SOMIT is more robust to outliers in the alternatives-criteria matrix (ACM); 3) SOMIT balances subjective expert knowledge with objective data-driven insights, thereby mitigating bias; 4) SOMIT is inherently modular, allowing both its individual parts and the complete approach to be seamlessly coupled with a wide range of MCDM methods commonly applied in energy systems and policy analysis; 5) a dedicated Python library, pysomit, is developed for SOMIT."}

While cell-level inconsistencies provide early warning signals of degradation and safety risks, the lack of scalable and interpretable decision-support frameworks prevents these signals from being effectively translated into operational actions. Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices. These results establish a scalable pathway for intelligent operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems, with direct implications for reliability, safety, and cost-effective integration of energy storage into modern power systems."}

The entanglement entropy exhibits pronounced peaks and follows the logarithmic scaling law at the phase transition points, from which we extract the central charge $c=1$. We further investigate the entanglement spectrum to accurately distinguish the different topological phases. In addition, the coupling between zero and $π$ modes leads to characteristic splittings in the entanglement spectrum, signaling their hybridization under periodic driving.

Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly.

We investigate whether improvements in stored energy and instantaneous charging power arise from genuine quantum correlations or from coherent collective dynamics that are not intrinsically quantum. We compare the time evolution of energetic quantities with a hierarchy of information-theoretic measures probing bipartite, tripartite, and further-partite correlations. Across different battery charger configurations, we find a consistent temporal ordering in which the instantaneous power peaks before the buildup of strong quantum correlations, indicating that peak charging is dominated by coherent transport, while entanglement and scrambling develop at later times. Furthermore, charging protocols based on k local interactions are examined under both unconstrained and norm-constrained (fair) settings, enabling a clear distinction between classical scaling effects and genuine collective enhancements. Increasing the interaction order or the participation number does not automatically translate into higher charging power. Instead, the performance is primarily dictated by how many particles actually become mutually correlated and contribute to entanglement. Fully collective interactions provide a genuine advantage because all particles participate coherently, whereas partially extended interaction schemes fail to monotonically increase the number of effectively interacting particles, and therefore do not guarantee improved charging efficiency."}

The potential applications of this technology have been widely explored, and extensive research over the past decades has been dedicated to developing scalable quantum computers. However, the question of the energetic performance of quantum computation has only gained attention more recently, and its importance is now recognized. In fact, quantum computers can only be a viable alternative if their energy cost scales favorably, and some research has shown that there is even a potential quantum energy advantage. Rydberg atoms have emerged recently as one of the most promising platforms to implement a large-scale quantum computer, with significant advances made in recent years. This work aims at contributing first steps to understand the energy efficiency of this platform, namely by investigating the energy consumption of the different elements of a Rydberg atom quantum computer. First, an experimental implementation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is analyzed, and an estimation of the energetic cost of executing this algorithm is calculated. Then, a potential scaling of the energy cost of performing the Quantum Fourier Transform with Rydberg atoms is derived. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the energy consumption of different elements within a Rydberg atom quantum computer, from the preparation of the atoms to the execution of the algorithm, and the measurement of the final state, enabling the evaluation of the energy expenditure of the Rydberg platform and the identification of potential improvements.

Within this framework, we prove that quantum neural networks exhibit a spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components of target functions, mirroring the behavior observed in classical deep networks. We further analyze the impact of noise and show that, when single-qubit noise is applied after encoding-layer rotations and modeled as a Pauli channel aligned with the rotation axis, the Fourier component labeled by $\\boldsymbolω$ is suppressed by a factor $(1-2γ)^{\\|\\boldsymbolω\\|_1}$. This leads to exponential attenuation of high-frequency terms while preserving the learnability of low-frequency structure. In the same setting, we establish that the resulting noisy circuits admit efficient classical simulation up to average-case error. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: Quantum neural networks primarily learn low-frequency features during early optimization and maintain robustness against dephasing and depolarizing noise acting on the encoding layer. Our results provide a frequency-domain lens that unifies classical and quantum learning dynamics, clarifies the role of noise in shaping trainability, and guides the design of noise-resilient quantum neural networks."}

Decades ago, these groups were shown to arise as the fundamental groups of the space of maps from the surface to the 2-sphere -- which has recently been understood as reflecting an effective FQH flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. Here we streamline and generalize this theorem using the homotopy theory of H-groups, showing that for $k \\in \\{1,2,4\\}$, the non-torsion part of $π_1 \\mathrm{Map}\\big({(S^{2k-1})^2, S^{2k}}\\big)$ is an integer Heisenberg group of level 2, where we identify this level with 2 divided by the Hopf invariant of the generator of $π_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$. This result implies the existence of higher-dimensional analogs of FQH anyons in the cohomotopical completion of 11D supergravity (\"Hypothesis H\")."}
