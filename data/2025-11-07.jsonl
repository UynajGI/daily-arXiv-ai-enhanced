Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in\ncertain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both\ntransverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into\nmeson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear\npotential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov\nstate complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under\nthe repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a\nsensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement\nmanifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following\nquenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal\nfield, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within\nthe paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal\nfield, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point\nto the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by\norders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement.\nNotably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies\ncorresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely\nmatching the semiclassical predictions."}

This research advances space thermal modeling by\nimproving the simulation accuracy and efficiency of radiative heat transfer,\nthe dominant mode of heat exchange in space. To this end, we incorporate\ndiffuse reflectivity using the Gebhart method, which computes radiative\nexchange factors (REFs) from geometric view factors. The view factors, obtained\nvia Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), require post-processing to mitigate\nstatistical errors. Critically, existing correction schemes cannot\nsimultaneously enforce closure and reciprocity for open systems. This research\naddresses this gap by proposing two novel enforcement methods: (i) a\nleast-squares optimization with non-negativity rectification (NNR) and small\npositive value avoidance (SPVA), and (ii) an iterative enforcement algorithm.\nTo ensure consistency across different discretization levels, this work also\nintroduces the multi-node surface model relations to formalize the connection\nbetween sub-face, face, and node representations of view factors and REFs. A\nsimple case study demonstrates a substantial reduction in mean absolute error\n(MAE): the least-squares method achieves an 81% MAE reduction, while the\niterative method offers the best balance of accuracy (56% MAE reduction) and\ncomputational efficiency. A second case study shows that including diffuse\nreflections decreases the steady-state temperature of a plate by $4^{\\circ}C$,\nreinforcing that reflected radiation reduces net absorption. This work\nintroduces and validates computationally efficient methods for integrating\ndiffuse reflectivity into space thermal analyses and for consistently coupling\nmulti-node surface radiative models.

As commonly understood,\nBell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of\nentanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing,\nincluding information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of\nrealism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have\nmetaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's\nhighest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this\nredefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of\nthe law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled\nlegal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we\nextend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking)\nand the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal\nentanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the\ninformational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across\nvarious legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it\noffers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in\nlaw--specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in\nreducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our\nmodel can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we\nexplore the application of legal theory back to physics.

Accurate modeling of such systems requires capturing both the\nlong-term statistical properties governed by slow variables and the short-term\ntransient dynamics driven by fast chaotic processes. We present a hybrid\ndata-driven framework that integrates score-based generative modeling with\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to construct reduced-order\nmodels (ROMs) capable of reproducing both regimes. The slow dynamics are\nrepresented by a Langevin equation whose drift is informed by a score function\nlearned via the K-means Gaussian Mixture Model (KGMM) method, ensuring faithful\nreproduction of the system's invariant measure. The fast chaotic forcing is\nmodeled by a NODE trained on delay-embedded residuals extracted from observed\ntrajectories, replacing conventional Gaussian noise approximations. We validate\nthis approach on a hierarchy of prototypical metastable systems driven by\nLorenz 63 dynamics, including bistable potentials with additive and\nmultiplicative forcing, and tristable non-autonomous systems with cycloperiodic\ncomponents. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid framework maintains\nstatistical consistency over long time horizons while accurately forecasting\nrare critical transitions between metastable states with lead times approaching\nthe Lyapunov time of the chaotic driver.

Double\nrobustness is achieved by augmenting standard covariate balancing with a\ndebiasing constraint tied to the propensity score model and a Neyman-orthogonal\nconstraint that removes first-order sensitivity to nuisance estimation.\nSelection of the weights on the entropy function can lead to the optimal\ncalibration estimator under a correctly specified outcome regression model. The\nproposed GEC weighting ha a nice geometric characterization: the GEC solution\nis the Bregman projection of the initial weights onto a constraint set, which\nyields a generalized Pythagorean identity and a nested decomposition that\nquantifies the incremental distance paid for additional constraints. We also\ndevelop a high-dimensional extension with soft calibration and a projection\ncalibration constraint that preserves doubly robust inference. Two simulation\nstudies are presented to compare the performance of the proposed method with\nthe existing methods."}

Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in\ncertain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both\ntransverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into\nmeson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear\npotential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov\nstate complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under\nthe repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a\nsensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement\nmanifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following\nquenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal\nfield, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within\nthe paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal\nfield, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point\nto the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by\norders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement.\nNotably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies\ncorresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely\nmatching the semiclassical predictions."}

Such systems can be\napproximated by a linear map of so-called signatures, which play a crucial role\nin the theory of rough paths and can be interpreted as collections of iterated\nintegrals involving the control process. As a consequence, we identify a\nuniversal bilinear system, solved by the signature, that can approximate the\nstate or output of the original nonlinear dynamics arbitrarily well. In\ncontrast to other (bi)linearization techniques, the signature approach remains\nfeasible in large-scale settings, as the dimension of the associated bilinear\nsystem grows only with the number of inputs. However, the signature model is\ntypically of high order, requiring an optimization process based on model order\nreduction (MOR). We derive an MOR method for unstable bilinear systems with\nnon-zero initial states and apply it to the signature, yielding a potentially\nlow-dimensional bilinear model. An advantage of our method is that the original\nnonlinear system need not be known explicitly, since only data are required to\nlearn the linear map of the signature. The subsequent MOR procedure is\nmodel-oriented and specifically designed for the signature process.\nConsequently, this work has two main applications: (1) efficient modeling/data\nfitting using small-scale bilinear systems, and (2) MOR for nonlinear systems.\nWe illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in the second application\nthrough numerical experiments."}

The present study develops a Comfort-Oriented\nEnergy Management System for Residential Buildings (ComEMS4Build) comprising\nPhotovoltaics (PV), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and H2 storage, where\nFC and HP are envisioned as complementary technologies. The fuzzy-logic-based\nComEMS4Build is designed and evaluated over a period of 12 weeks in winter for\na family household building in Germany using a semi-synthetic modeling\napproach. The Rule-Based Control (RBC), which serves as a lower benchmark, is a\nscheduler designed to require minimal inputs for operation. The Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) is intended as a cost-optimal benchmark with an ideal\nforecast. The results show that ComEMS4Build, similar to MPC, does not violate\nthe thermal comfort of occupants in 10 out of 12 weeks, while RBC has a\nslightly higher median discomfort of 0.68 Kh. The ComEMS4Build increases the\nweekly electricity costs by 12.06 EUR compared to MPC, while RBC increases the\nweekly costs by 30.14 EUR. The ComEMS4Build improves the Hybrid Energy Storage\nSystem (HESS) utilization and energy exchange with the main grid compared to\nthe RBC. However, when it comes to the FC operation, the RBC has an advantage,\nas it reduces the toggling counts by 3.48% and working hours by 7.59% compared\nto MPC..."}

These models\nhave received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and\nanimal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization\nproblem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that\nappear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed\ntheoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical\nresults, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL\nmodels based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then\nevaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some\nbenchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate\nthat our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while\nsignificantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python\npackage for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the\nanalysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex\noptimization."}
