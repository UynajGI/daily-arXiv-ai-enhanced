This study addresses the challenge of distinguishing stable influencers from transient ones among users who are influential at a given point in time. We particularly focus on two distinct types of influencers: source spreaders, who widely disseminate their own content, and brokers, who play a key role in propagating information originating from others. Using six months of retweet data from approximately 19,000 Twitter users, we analyze the characteristics of stable influencers. Our findings reveal that users who have maintained influence in the past are more likely to continue doing so in the future. Furthermore, we develop classification models to predict stable influencers among temporarily influential users, achieving an AUC of approximately 0.89 for source spreaders and 0.81 for brokers. Our experimental results highlight that current influence is a critical factor in classifying influencers, while past influence also significantly contributes, particularly for source spreaders."}

Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses.\n  This study presents a privacy-preserving synthetic mobility dataset that reconstructs daily trajectories from aggregated inputs. The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required.\n  The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations.\n  The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains."}

The analysis is conducted based on four main aspects: media characteristics, da'wah communication strategies, audience engagement effectiveness, and user behavioral responses. The research employs a descriptive quantitative approach through observations of the popular da'wah account @hananattakistory during the period of October to November 2025. The findings indicate that TikTok excels in the effectiveness of disseminating da'wah messages through high interaction rates, achieving an engagement rate of 1.42%. In contrast, Instagram records a higher total interaction with an engagement rate of 5.47%, reflecting deeper and more reflective audience involvement. Qualitative analysis shows that TikTok is more effective in the initial stage of capturing audience attention (awareness), while Instagram is stronger in building loyalty and fostering a digital da'wah community. Thus, combining the use of both platforms can serve as a complementary digital da'wah strategy, expanding reach while deepening the understanding of Islamic values in the era of social media. The main contribution of this study lies in its comparative, empirically grounded approach that integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses to map the effectiveness of da'wah across platforms, providing a strategic foundation for developing adaptive and contextual digital da'wah for young Muslim audiences."}

In this paper, we develop a new perspective on scientific realism that responds to this challenge. We argue that while realist commitment remains appropriate at the level of a theory's full formal structure, ontological commitment should be treated as tied to specific empirical contexts rather than to a fixed, real ontology. Our proposal draws inspiration from Dennett's notion of a \"compression algorithm\" as a defining criterion of a scientific theory. On this basis, we separate realism from ontological commitment. To clarify the stakes of this distinction, we contrast our approach with common core realism, which locates ontology in the invariant structure shared by dual models. Focusing on dualities in quantum mechanics and string theory, we show how our view accommodates ontological pluralism while preserving a robust form of structural realism."}

However, long before van Raan (2004a) Garfield studied the phenomenon in a series of articles from 1970 up to year 2004. In the present study we ask the pertinent question; Has the phenomenon of DR itself suffered the delayed recognition? In search of an answer we study the citation history of the Garfield (1980a) paper in which Garfield addressed DR directly for the first time. We find that the paper hardly received the attention befitting the Garfield's stature as an information scientist. Specifically, the paper received a meager of 10 citations up to the publication year of van Raan (2004a) and was then, in 2007, feebly awakened from its deep sleep of twenty-eight years receiving 20 citations in next four years; up to 2010.

Classical Control Barrier Function (CBF) filters assume global availability of the safety function - its value and gradient must be known everywhere - an assumption incompatible with sensing-limited settings, and the resulting filters often exhibit nonsmooth switching when constraints activate. We propose two complementary perception-aware safety filters applicable to general control-invariant safety sets. The first introduces a smooth perception gate that modulates barrier constraints based on sensing range, yielding a closed-form Lipschitz-safe controller with forward-invariance guarantees. The second replaces the hard CBF constraint with a differentiable penalty term, leading to a smooth unconstrained optimization-based safety filter consistent with CBF principles. For both designs, we establish existence, uniqueness, and forward invariance of the closed-loop trajectories. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed smooth filters enable the synthesis of higher-order tracking controllers for systems such as drones and second-order ground robots, offering substantially smoother and more robust safety-critical behaviors than classical CBF-based filters."}

This problem arises across many applications, such as astrophysics (e.g., detecting astrophysical events such as gravitational waves, with two or more detectors) and neuroscience (e.g., detecting synchronous firing patterns between two or more neurons). In this work, we consider methods based on time-shifting, where the timeline of one data stream is randomly shifted relative to another, to mimic the types of coincidences that could occur by random chance. Our theoretical results establish rigorous finite-sample guarantees controlling the probability of false positives, under weak assumptions that allow for dependence within the time series data, providing reassurance that time-shifting methods are a reliable tool for inference in this setting. Empirical results with simulated and real data validate the strong performance of time-shifting methods in dependent-data settings."}

We utilize and reinterpret classic concepts from electromagnetism in the setting of cyclical nonequilibrium processes. We show that the housekeeping heat can be controlled to be arbitrarily close to zero by minimizing nonequilibrium fluctuations. It immediately follows from our results that the constant-velocity angle clamp protocol applied to the $F_1$ molecular motor in a recent experiment [Mishima et at, 2025] is in fact the globally optimal protocol: it produces zero housekeeping heat and simultaneously minimizes dissipation and maximizes work transduction."}

Ising machines implemented using dynamical, digital and compute-in-memory (CiM) approaches offer a promising alternative, but often suffer from poor initialization and a fundamental trade-off between algorithmic performance and hardware efficiency. Hardware-friendly schemes such as simulated annealing converge slowly, whereas faster algorithms, including simulated bifurcation, are difficult to implement efficiently in CiM hardware, limiting both convergence speed and solution quality. To address these limitations, here we present a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based CiM Ising framework that tightly co-designs algorithms and hardware to efficiently solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed approach employs a two-step algorithmic flow: an attention-inspired initialization that exploits global spin topology and reduces the required iterations by up to 80%, followed by a lightweight simulated bifurcation algorithm specifically tailored for CiM implementation. To natively accelerate the core vector-matrix and vector-matrix-vector operations in both steps, we fabricate a 32x256 FeFET CiM chip using ferroelectric capacitors integrated at the back end of line of a 180-nm CMOS platform. Across Max-Cut instances with up to 100,000 nodes, the proposed hardware-software co-designed solver achieves up to a 175.9x speedup over a GPU-based simulated bifurcation implementation while consistently delivering superior solution quality."}

In this paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of two popular classes of LLMs, namely GPT and Gemini models, to construct two-level fractional factorial designs with 8, 16, and 32 runs, and 4 to 26 factors. To this end, we use prompting techniques to develop a high-quality set of design construction tasks for the LLMs. We compare the designs obtained by the LLMs with the best-known designs in terms of resolution and minimum aberration criteria. We show that the LLMs can effectively construct optimal 8-, 16-, and 32-run designs with up to eight factors."}

Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in coordination strategies due to its model-free nature. Current methods lack explicit quantification of the relationship between individual and joint risk values, resulting in obscured credit assignment. Moreover, they often depend on explicit communication, which becomes inefficient as system complexity grows. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework with shared memory (RRL-SM) for multi-microgrid scheduling. Specifically, a risk-sensitive value factorization scheme is proposed to quantify the relationship between individual and joint risk values by leveraging distributional modeling and attention-based representations, thereby aligning local decisions with global risk objectives. An implicit shared-memory coordination mechanism is implemented through a global memory space to enhance the overall efficiency of decentralized decision-making. Collectively, the integrated approach delivers more reliable cooperative scheduling under renewable energy uncertainty. Simulation results show that RRL-SM reduces load-shedding risk by 84.5%, demonstrating a favorable balance between reliability and economic performance."}

For uniformly bounded Lipschitz operators, we prove information-theoretic lower bounds together with matching or near-matching upper bounds, covering both fixed and random designs under Hilbert-valued Gaussian noise and Gaussian white noise errors. The rates are controlled by the spectrum of the covariance operator of the measure that defines the error metric. Our setup is very general and allows for measures with unbounded support. A key implication is a curse of sample complexity which shows that the minimax risk for generic Lipschitz operators cannot decay at any algebraic rate in the sample size. We obtain essentially sharp characterizations when the covariance spectrum decays exponentially and provide general upper and lower bounds in slower-decay regimes."}

Exploiting an exchange symmetry in the equal-transmission regime, we reduce the dynamics to a lower-dimensional invariant subsystem and analyze the impact of the co-infection recovery rate. We prove that slower recovery of co-infected individuals monotonically increases the co-infection burden and yields a lower bound on epidemic duration that grows as the co-infection recovery rate decreases. Numerical simulations further indicate that reduced co-infection recovery can increase the epidemic peak, an effect supported by a sensitivity-equation analysis. Together, these results highlight how co-infection-specific recovery dynamics can substantially alter transient epidemic behavior, even in the absence of endemic equilibria."}

Grounded in scientific literature, technical analyses, and current policy frameworks, the survey was distributed through various channels-including public institutions, online platforms, and field outreach-and collected 403 responses. It examined user difficulties in managing heating, including challenges with controls, bill comprehension, and communication with landlords. It also explored behaviours with high energy-savings impact: reducing heating at night or during absences, window opening, and shutter use. Findings show that many residents face barriers to energy-efficient heating, often due to difficult-to-use controls, limited feedback on consumption, and poor support from landlords or property managers. Those who do not reduce heating at night or when away frequently report these challenges. Participants expressed strong interest in solutions such as personalized advice, real-time feedback, and connected radiator valves to improve comfort, control, and energy management. This work highlights the need to better integrate user experience into multifamily housing energy policies. It provides actionable insights for policymakers and housing providers seeking to enhance comfort and energy savings while supporting France and Europe's broader energy transition goals."}

To enhance the stability and safety under measurement degradation and motion uncertainty, we jointly design a robust factor-graph-based target localization method and a covariance-aware control Lyapunov function--control barrier function (CLF--CBF) tracking controller.

Adaptive variants update this subset in time, but multiscale systems with widely separated reaction rates remain challenging, as low-probability bottleneck states can carry essential probability flux and the dynamics alternate between fast transients and slowly evolving stiff regimes. We propose a flux-based adaptive FSP method that uses probability flux to drive both state-space pruning and time-step selection. The pruning rule protects low-probability states with large outgoing flux, preserving connectivity in bottleneck systems, while the time-step rule adapts to the instantaneous total flux to handle rate constants spanning several orders of magnitude. Numerical experiments on stiff, oscillatory, and bottleneck reaction networks show that the method maintains accuracy while using substantially smaller state spaces."}

As a paradigmatic example, we consider the quantum Ising chain in the presence of homogeneous transverse ($g$) and longitudinal ($h$) magnetic fields. This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g<g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i < 0$ to a positive value $h_f>0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian ${\\hat H}(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics for different values of $g$, finding qualitatively distinct behaviors for $g > g_c$ (where the chain is in the disordered phase), for $g = g_c$ (QQ across the CQT), and for $g<g_c$ (QQ across the FOQT line)."}

Our experiments compare snapshot GNNs, a simplified temporal GNN prototype, and standard baselines (logistic regression and Random Forest). Results show that structural network information provides useful early-warning signals compared to feature-based models alone.\n  This correlation-based instantiation of SRR demonstrates that graph-derived features capture meaningful changes in market structure during stress events.

For diagonal states the GKSL dynamics reduces to the classical two-state master equation.The density-matrix language permits an operational ``Bloch half-disk'' embedding with overlap parameter $c(\\varepsilon)$ quantifying partition fuzziness; the GKSL model is fitted to diagonal marginals treating $c(\\varepsilon)$ as diagnostic. We derive closed-form solutions, an explicit Kraus representation (generalized amplitude damping with dephasing and rotation), and practical diagnostics for the time-homogeneous first-order Markov assumption (order tests, Chapman--Kolmogorov consistency, run-length statistics, stationarity checks). When higher-order memory appears, we extend the framework via augmented Markov models, constructing CPTP maps through discrete-time Kraus representations; continuous-time GKSL generators may not exist for all empirical transition matrices.

Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction."}

Using data from all 30 current franchises and six candidate cities (Seattle, Las Vegas, Montreal, Vancouver, Tampa, and Mexico City), we evaluate 15 pairwise expansion scenarios under alternative season lengths and divisional formats.

False Discovery Rate (FDR) control methods are able to control false signals in scientific discoveries.

To enhance the stability and reproducibility of statistical outcomes, we propose a general stability approach for FDR control in feature selection and multiple testing problems, named FDR Stabilizer. Taking feature selection as an example, our method first aggregates feature importance statistics obtained by multiple runs of the base FDR control procedure into a consensus ranking. Then, we construct a stabilized relaxed e-value for each feature and apply the e-BH procedure to these stabilized e-values to obtain the final selection set. We theoretically derive the finite-sample bounds for the FDR and the power of our method, and show that our method asymptotically controls the FDR without power loss. Moreover, we establish the stability of the proposed method, showing that the stabilized selection set converges to a deterministic limit as the number of repetitions increases. Extensive numerical experiments and applications to real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method generally outperforms existing alternatives."}

However, the requirements in terms of X-ray beam quality have limited its use to large synchrotron facilities and, to date, only one attempt has been made to translate the technique to a small-scale laboratory. To unleash the power of this technique to the broad user community of laboratory X-ray sources, there are outstanding questions to answer including whether the quantitativeness of the information is preserved in a laboratory despite the drastic decrease in X-ray flux of several orders of magnitude, with respect to synchrotron instruments. In this study not only we demonstrate that the quantitativeness of X-ray ptychography is preserved in a laboratory setting, but we also apply the method to the imaging of a brain tissue phantom.

Existing deep learning models lack flexibility to handle dynamic network configurations. Furthermore, many approaches overlook pilot contamination and suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight transformer model that overcomes these limitations by jointly predicting AP clusters and powers solely from spatial coordinates of user devices and AP. Our model is architecture-agnostic to users load, handles both clustering and power allocation without channel estimation overhead, and eliminates pilot contamination by assigning users to AP within a pilot reuse constraint. We also incorporate a customized linear attention mechanism to capture user-AP interactions efficiently and enable linear scalability with respect to the number of users. Numerical results confirm the model's effectiveness in maximizing the minimum spectral efficiency and providing near-optimal performance while ensuring adaptability and scalability in dynamic scenarios."}

By neglecting truncation error from basis expansion, two main sources of errors propagate to the final sensitivity indices: the metamodeling related error and the sampling-based, or pick-freeze (PF), estimation error. This work provides an efficient algorithm to estimate these errors in the frame of Gaussian processes (GP), based on the approach of Le Gratiet et al. [16]. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the number of basis coefficients of expanded model outputs is significantly smaller than output dimensions. Basis coefficients are fitted by GP models and multiple conditional GP trajectories are sampled. Then, vector-valued PF estimation is used to speed-up the estimation of Sobol indices and generalized sensitivity indices (GSI). We illustrate the methodology on an analytical test case and on an application in non-Newtonian hydraulics, modelling an idealized dam-break flow. Numerical tests show an improvement of 15 times in the computational time when compared to the application of Le Gratiet et al. [16] algorithm separately over each output dimension."}

Under these conditions, the usual low-temperature long-range order is replaced by robust convection patterns, featuring regularly spaced stripe structures for suitable geometries. These nonequilibrium states differ markedly from those obtained in an equilibrium dynamics with the same local temperature profile.

Moreover, the temporal change of the relations between predictors and responses in time series induce a possibly time-varying grouping structure in the responses. To address these limitations, a Bayesian Markov-switching partial RR (MS-PRR) model is proposed, where the response vector is partitioned in two groups to reflect different complexity of the relationship. A \\textit{simple} group assumes a low-rank linear regression, while a \\textit{complex} group exploits nonparametric regression via a Gaussian Process. Differently from traditional approaches, group assignments and rank are treated as unknown parameters to be estimated. Then temporal persistence in the regression function is accounted for by a Markov-switching process that drives the changes in the grouping structure and model parameters over time. Full Bayesian inference is preformed via a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler, which allows uncertainty quantification without the need for trans-dimensional moves. Applications to two real-world macroeconomic and commodity data demonstrate the evidence of time-varying grouping and different degrees of complexity both across states and within each state."}

In this work, large-eddy simulation (LES) is employed to investigate the effects of the Coriolis force on the characteristics of turbulent coherent structures in the conventionally neutral atmospheric boundary layers (CNBL). Variation of the Coriolis force is realized by changing latitude or geostrophic wind speed.We found that the Coriolis force causes distinct deflection of coherent velocity structures to the geostrophic wind direction, which is not aligned with the direction of either the mean wind or the mean shear. By plotting against the difference between the local wind veer angle and the global cross-isobaric angle, the structure deflection angle under different conditions can be well collapsed, indicating a possible universal relationship. Moreover, we also studied the effect of the Coriolis force on the inclination angle of large-scale turbulent structures. It is found that as latitude decreases or geostrophic wind speed increases, the inclination angle in the surface layer increases, probably due to the deflection of turbulent structures caused by the Coriolis force."}

Two of the spin-charge ground states, respectively consists of three-site and six-site ferromagnetic (FM) clusters arranged in anti-FM and $120^{\\circ}$ Yafet-Kittel (YK) phase which we label as S-AF (super-antiferromagnet) and S-YK (super-YK) respectively.

These underlying magnetic textures (except S-YK state) restrict electrons in fragmented small regions (e.g, triangular units, two-site dimers, three-site line segments respectively in S-AF, FM-D and FM-T), resulting in flat bands by opening large gaps in electronic density of states, which in turn stabilize these coupled spin-charge states: a \"band effect\".

Classical Control Barrier Function (CBF) filters assume global availability of the safety function - its value and gradient must be known everywhere - an assumption incompatible with sensing-limited settings, and the resulting filters often exhibit nonsmooth switching when constraints activate. We propose two complementary perception-aware safety filters applicable to general control-invariant safety sets. The first introduces a smooth perception gate that modulates barrier constraints based on sensing range, yielding a closed-form Lipschitz-safe controller with forward-invariance guarantees. The second replaces the hard CBF constraint with a differentiable penalty term, leading to a smooth unconstrained optimization-based safety filter consistent with CBF principles. For both designs, we establish existence, uniqueness, and forward invariance of the closed-loop trajectories. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed smooth filters enable the synthesis of higher-order tracking controllers for systems such as drones and second-order ground robots, offering substantially smoother and more robust safety-critical behaviors than classical CBF-based filters."}

Benchmarks against DMRG and exact diagonalization show consistent qualitative agreement, with accuracy improving systematically in more anisotropic regimes.

DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through an embedded differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN successfully produces a feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. Moreover, the embedded OPF layer enables DA-DNN to generalize to untrained system configurations, such as changes in line flow limits. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability and generalization ability."}

In particular, these models allow to infer how the animal's decision-making process interacts with internal and external drivers, by relating the probabilities of switching between distinct behavioural states to covariates. A key challenge arising in the statistical analysis of behavioural data using covariate-driven HMMs is the models' interpretation, especially when there are more than two states, as then several functional relationships between state-switching probabilities and covariates need to be jointly interpreted. The model-implied probabilities of occupying the different states, as a function of a covariate of interest, constitute a much simpler summary statistic. A pragmatic approximation of the state occupancy distribution, namely the hypothetical stationary distribution of the model's underlying Markov chain for fixed covariate values, has in fact routinely been reported in HMM-based analyses of ecological data. However, for stochastically varying covariates with relatively little persistence, we show that this approximation can be severely biased, potentially invalidating ecological inference. We develop two alternative approaches for obtaining the state occupancy distribution as a function of a covariate of interest - one based on resampling of the covariate process, the other obtained by regression analysis of the empirical state probabilities. The practical application of these approaches is demonstrated in simulations and a case study on Galápagos tortoise (Chelonoidis niger) movement data. Our methods enable practitioners to conduct unbiased inference on the relationship between animal behaviour and general types of covariates, thus allowing to uncover the factors influencing behavioural decisions made by animals."}

Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications."}

We propose a flux-based adaptive FSP method that uses probability flux to drive both state-space pruning and time-step selection. The pruning rule protects low-probability states with large outgoing flux, preserving connectivity in bottleneck systems, while the time-step rule adapts to the instantaneous total flux to handle rate constants spanning several orders of magnitude.

Part of the temperature trends are caused by circulation changes, which are not accurately captured in climate models. Here we deploy Deep Learning techniques to classify European heatwaves based on their atmospheric circulation and to study their associated changes over time. We use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the heatwave samples, after which we cluster them on their extraced features. The VAE is trained on large ensemble climate model simulations and we show that the VAE generalizes well to observed heatwave circulations in ERA5 reanalysis, without the need for transfer learning. The circulation features relevant for heatwaves in ERA5 are consistent with the climate model heatwaves. Regression analysis reveals that the Atlantic Plume type of heatwaves are becoming more frequent over time, while the Atlantic High heatwaves are becoming less frequent. We introduce new and straightforward interpretability methods to study the latent space, including feature importance identification and changes over time. We investigate which circulation features are associated with the most important nodes in the latent space and how the latent space changes over time. For example, we find that the Atlantic Low heatwave shows a deepening of the low pressure system off the Atlantic coast over time. Each heatwave type is undergoing unique changes in their circulation, highlighting the necessity to study each heatwave type separately.

The coexistence of bands with Dirac points similar to those in graphene, along with a completely flat band, makes this an ideal structure for investigating how lattice symmetries may protect topological and many-body correlation effects. Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system. These results demonstrate that strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities."}

Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in coordination strategies due to its model-free nature. Current methods lack explicit quantification of the relationship between individual and joint risk values, resulting in obscured credit assignment. Moreover, they often depend on explicit communication, which becomes inefficient as system complexity grows. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework with shared memory (RRL-SM) for multi-microgrid scheduling. Specifically, a risk-sensitive value factorization scheme is proposed to quantify the relationship between individual and joint risk values by leveraging distributional modeling and attention-based representations, thereby aligning local decisions with global risk objectives. An implicit shared-memory coordination mechanism is implemented through a global memory space to enhance the overall efficiency of decentralized decision-making. Collectively, the integrated approach delivers more reliable cooperative scheduling under renewable energy uncertainty. Simulation results show that RRL-SM reduces load-shedding risk by 84.5%, demonstrating a favorable balance between reliability and economic performance."}

This paper investigates how a minority of voters with greater flexibility in their political preferences influences opinion formation in polarized electorates. Using a modified Deffuant model, we show that even simple heterogeneity in agents' openness to vote switching can generate rich and unexpected collective outcomes: \"open-minded\" agents may (i) prevent full convergence into established party blocs, (ii) give rise to transient centrist clusters, or (iii) align with the positions of major parties. These dynamics resemble empirical patterns observed among real-world independent voters. Our results demonstrate that small shifts in openness parameters can substantially reshape the macroscopic structure of political competition, offering a simple explanation for oscillatory electoral outcomes and the emergence of unstable centrist or cross-cutting coalitions."}

The controller architecture aims to measure the interlayer temperature by a laterally positioned thermal camera and maintain a preset reference temperature by switching between the heating mode through dynamic laser power adjustment and the cooling mode by assigning interlayer dwell time to allow cooling between layers. The switching controller employs a feedback optimization control algorithm for the heating mode to adjust the laser power, and a triggering algorithm that increases the interlayer dwell time until the interlayer temperature reaches the reference value. Additionally, the study compares the performance of the proposed controller in both supported and unsupported overhanging parts to evaluate the effect of support structures on the controller performance as well as the thermal behavior of overhanging parts. Results demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in stabilizing interlayer temperature across varying cross-sectional areas while remaining within the material's stable processing zone. In the heating mode, the controller efficiently stabilizes temperature, even in geometries with significant cross-section variation. The study also identifies trade-offs among process efficiency, energy consumption, and build time. Supported parts exhibit reduced overheating but consume more energy and material, while unsupported parts stabilize interlayer temperature faster but with longer build times due to increased dwell time assignments. The research highlights notable improvements in interlayer temperature control for geometries prone to excessive thermal stresses. Moreover, the introduction of interlayer dwell time offers a practical solution to maintaining thermal stability in complex geometries."}

By neglecting truncation error from basis expansion, two main sources of errors propagate to the final sensitivity indices: the metamodeling related error and the sampling-based, or pick-freeze (PF), estimation error. This work provides an efficient algorithm to estimate these errors in the frame of Gaussian processes (GP), based on the approach of Le Gratiet et al. [16]. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the number of basis coefficients of expanded model outputs is significantly smaller than output dimensions. Basis coefficients are fitted by GP models and multiple conditional GP trajectories are sampled. Then, vector-valued PF estimation is used to speed-up the estimation of Sobol indices and generalized sensitivity indices (GSI). We illustrate the methodology on an analytical test case and on an application in non-Newtonian hydraulics, modelling an idealized dam-break flow. Numerical tests show an improvement of 15 times in the computational time when compared to the application of Le Gratiet et al. [16] algorithm separately over each output dimension."}

We propose a convex mixed-integer formulation of the problem and leverage first-order convex optimization to tackle it, following a stream of recent work on optimization-driven graph isomorphism detection. We strengthen our formulation with variable fixing techniques that prove highly effective while preserving the polyhedral structure. We perform extensive computations evaluating the performance of different families of methods including a mixed-integer convex formulation, mixed-integer linear optimization, local search and spectral heuristics over a collection of challenging GI instances. We find that a high level of symmetry is beneficial for optimization-based methods. On the other hand, presolving techniques that detect local substructures to fix variables are crucial for asymmetric instances. The proposed method outperforms the second best approach, the integer feasibility approach, on 6 of the 12 graphs families and is on par with it on symmetric families."}

Next, we compute a hazard severity index (HSI) by normalizing 24-hour rainfall against local Atlas-14 100-year, 24-hour depths. We then integrate IHL and HSI within a localized threat severity (LTS) matrix using 20 class-specific triggers, requiring lower exceedance in high-risk terrain and higher exceedance in uplands. Applied to two Texas flood events, the LTS exhibits statistically significant spatial association with independent crowdsourced impact proxies, capturing observed disruption hotspots. The framework is computationally lightweight, scalable, and extends actionable situational awareness into a 48-72 hour anticipatory window, supporting pre-event decision-making by emergency managers."}

There is considerable uncertainty in its likelihood for a given scenario and the critical global warming threshold. An alternative are early-warning signals (EWS) in AMOC fingerprints, which leverage generic statistical properties before destabilization of a steady state (a saddle-node bifurcation). But an AMOC collapse may be a sequence of partial collapses with shutdown of deep water formation in distinct regions.\n  A conceptual model is presented featuring a sequential shutdown in two deep water formation regions. Multiple tipping points are present that do not follow the saddle-node normal form. As a result, the choice of the observable used to monitor EWS dramatically influences the prediction of the collapse via EWS. Various trends in EWS for different observables make it hard to determine what type of collapse (partial or full) will follow."}

While this property has been investigated in many weakly-correlated altermagnetic materials, the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure has remained little explored, particularly in metals. Here, we propose NiS2 as a prototypical strongly correlated metallic altermagnet. While at ambient pressure this compound is an altermagnetic Mott insulator, it undergoes a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) while maintaining its altermagnetic ordered phase. By systematically comparing DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT, we disentangle how strong static and dynamic correlations modify the electronic structure. Specifically, the spin splitting of the bands is modified not only through the enhancement of the local magnetic moment caused by static correlations, but also by the momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization caused by dynamic correlations. Moreover, dynamic electronic correlations cause a pronounced lifetime asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles, an effect that is amplified by the particle-hole asymmetry promoted by Hund's correlations. Our results not only shed light on the rich landscape of correlation effects in metallic altermagnets, but also establishes NiS2 as a platform to investigate the interplay between Mott and Hund physics and altermagnetic order."}

The UAV is supposed to fly along a periodical circular trajectory at a fixed height for ISAC service supply from the sky. We consider on-demand sensing services, where on-demand detection and on-demand localization requests may be activated at any time toward any position within the targeted serving region. While guaranteeing satisfactory accuracy for both on-demand sensing tasks, we aim at maximizing the minimum achievable throughput among all communication users, via joint optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication user scheduling. To address the complicated problem with infinite sensing constraints, we characterize the on-demand detection constraint as a restricted deployment area for UAV and the on-demand localization constraint as Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints over finite reference target points, based on which the original problem is simplified to more tractable one. Afterwards, particularly aiming to ensure no violations of CRB constraints, we propose a convex approximation for the reformulated problem, where tight approximation is guaranteed at given local solution. The construction strategy for convex problem approximation allows an efficient iterative algorithm with verified convergence to a superior suboptimal solution. At last, with simulations, we verified the applicability of our developed optimization scheme in strictly fulfilling the on-demand sensing constraints and the effectiveness of our proposed solution for simultaneously enhancing the communication throughput in UAV-enabled ISAC."}

This structure is not a rigid grid but a sparse k-nearest neighbors graph derived from the latent geometry in the data, ensuring high-dimensional tractability. We extend this framework to a dynamic spatio-temporal process, allowing item effects to evolve via an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

In computational settings, most protein language models (PLMs) are not trained to favor high-affinity antibodies, and existing preference optimization approaches introduce substantial computational overhead without clear affinity gains. Therefore, this work proposes SimBinder-IF, which converts the inverse folding model ESM-IF into an antibody sequence generator by freezing its structure encoder and training only its decoder to prefer experimentally stronger binders through preference optimization.\n  Results: On the 11-assay AbBiBench benchmark, SimBinder-IF achieves a 55 percent relative improvement in mean Spearman correlation between log-likelihood scores and experimentally measured binding affinity compared to vanilla ESM-IF (from 0.264 to 0.410). In zero-shot generalization across four unseen antigen-antibody complexes, the correlation improves by 156 percent (from 0.115 to 0.294). SimBinder-IF also outperforms baselines in top-10 precision for ten-fold or greater affinity improvements.

Deep ensembles, or ensembles of probabilistic neural networks, are state of the art for UQ in machine learning (ML) and are growing increasingly popular for weather and climate prediction. However, detailed analyses of the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of ensembles in these complex problem settings are lacking. We take a step towards filling this gap by deploying deep ensembles for predictability analysis of the El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Community Earth System Model 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE). Principally, we show that epistemic uncertainty, modeled by ensemble disagreement, robustly signals predictive error growth associated with shifts in the distributions of monthly sea-surface temperature (SST), ocean heat content (OHC), and zonal surface wind stress ($τ_x$) anomalies under a climate change scenario. Conversely, we find that aleatoric uncertainty, which remains a popular measure of model confidence, becomes less reliable and behaves counterintuitively under climate-change-induced distributional shift. We highlight that, because ensemble performance improvement relative to the expected single model scales with epistemic uncertainty, ensemble improvement increases with distributional shift from climate change. This work demonstrates the utility of deep ensembles for modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ML climate prediction, as well as the growing importance of robustly quantifying these two forms of uncertainty under anthropogenic warming."}

The Hidden Geometry of 10 Million Transactions", "comment": null, "summary": "The global aid system functions as a complex and evolving ecosystem; yet widespread understanding of its structure remains largely limited to aggregate volume flows. Here we map the network topology of global aid using a dataset of unprecedented scale: over 10 million transaction records connecting 2,456 publishing organisations across 230 countries between 1967 and 2025. We apply bipartite projection and dimensionality reduction to reveal the geometry of the system and unveil hidden patterns. This exposes distinct functional clusters that are otherwise sparsely connected. We find that while governments and multilateral agencies provide the primary resources, a small set of knowledge brokers provide the critical connectivity. Universities and research foundations specifically act as essential bridges between disparate islands of implementers and funders. We identify a core solar system of 25 central actors who drive this connectivity including unanticipated brokers like J-PAL and the Hewlett Foundation. These findings demonstrate that influence in the aid ecosystem flows through structural connectivity as much as financial volume. Our results provide a new framework for donors to identify strategic partners that accelerate coordination and evidence diffusion across the global network."}

This report examines a rural Swiss case study to explore the techno-economic implications of CELs for both participants and the local DSO. The findings indicate that CELs can enhance the local use of renewable generation, particularly photovoltaics, and offer modest financial gains, with outcomes strongly shaped by community size, composition, and tariff design. Larger and more heterogeneous communities achieve better internal matching of supply and demand, though the overall incentive remains limited because the tariff reduction applies only to distribution charges. The study further shows that internal energy exchange is maximized when local PV generation covers roughly 1-2 times the community load. For DSOs, CELs reduce grid imports (27-46%), resulting in a substantial reduction in distribution tariff revenues (17-36%), necessitating regulatory adaptation. While centralized batteries provide economic value to members, their technical impact on the grid remains modest due to their small, economically optimized capacity. Larger centralized storage is shown to reduce transformer peak power, but risks increasing line loading, suggesting a need for careful sizing and placement."}

While global TC records have been systematically maintained since the early 1940s, substantial uncertainties remain for the pre-satellite era during which TC observations relied mostly on scattered aircraft reconnaissance and sporadic ship reports. This study presents a deep learning (DL) approach to reconstruct historical TC activity in the western North Pacific (WNP) basin, with a main focus on the pre-satellite era. Using data feature enrichment tailored for tropical cyclogenesis (TCG), we demonstrate that DL can effectively capture the main characteristics and changes in TCG climatology during the post-satellite era. With additional cross-validations, the reconstruction of TCG climatology is then extended to a pre-satellite period (1940-1960) during which TC base-track datasets are most uncertain. Our DL reconstruction reveals a significant missing of TCG in the current best-track data between September and November during the pre-satellite era. Such a TCG undercount in the best track data occurs mainly around 10-15$^\\circ$N in the central WNP, while coastal regions show better consistency with DL reconstruction. These findings not only highlight the potential of DL for improving historical assessments of TC activity, but also advance our understanding of TCG processes by identifying key environmental conditions conducive to TC formation. The DL approach presented herein can be applied to other ocean basins, climate proxies, or reanalysis datasets for future TC climate studies."}

However, we lack a model which can match the spatial-temporal detail of historical changes at the level of individual linguistic features, and which offers a principled mechanism to predict the future. Here we present a statistical field theory for the evolution of linguistic variables which takes steps to fill this gap. Linguistic variant frequencies are represented as a stochastic state field with spatial interaction and social conformity, coupled to a latent bias field with Onsager Machlup action that reduces overfitting to data. We derive parameter inference procedures and demonstrate them using examples of large-scale dialect survey data from the twentieth century United States. The bias field has a characteristic half-life, which determines the horizon over which linguistic change can be predicted. Inferred model parameters provide evidence for surface-tension-driven coarsening of dialect regions, with population-density gradients exerting systematic forces on interfaces."}

While more sample-efficient than comparative alternatives like reinforcement learning, IL is sensitive to compounding errors induced by distribution shifts. There are two significant sources of distribution shifts when using IL-based feedback laws on systems: distribution shifts caused by policy error and distribution shifts due to exogenous disturbances and endogenous model errors due to lack of learning. Our previously developed approaches, Taylor Series Imitation Learning (TaSIL) and $\\mathcal{L}_1$ -Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control (\\ellonedrac), address the challenge of distribution shifts in complementary ways. While TaSIL offers robustness against policy error-induced distribution shifts, \\ellonedrac offers robustness against distribution shifts due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

The continuum nature of the $φ^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $φ^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as the market kurtosis, which can serve as an indicator of possible market shocks. Accurate reproduction of high kurtosis is absent in binarized models. Therefore Ising models, despite being widely employed in econophysics, are incapable of fully representing empirical financial data, a limitation not present in the generalization of the $φ^{4}$ scalar field theory. We then investigate the scaling properties of the $φ^{4}$ machine learning algorithm and extract exponents which govern the behavior of the learned couplings (or weights and biases in ML language) in relation to the number of stocks in the model. Finally, we use our model to forecast the price changes of the AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA stocks. We conclude by discussing how the $φ^{4}$ scalar field theory could be used to build investment strategies and the possible intuitions that the QFT operations of dimensional compactification and renormalization can provide for financial modelling."}

Yet systematic evaluations of when and where higher resolution actually improves impact model outcomes remain limited, and it is unclear whether increasing spatial resolution consistently enhances performance across sectors, regions, and forcing variables. Here we show that gains in climate input accuracy and impact model performance are largest when moving from coarse (60 km) to intermediate (10 km) resolution, while further refinement to 3 km and 1 km yields more modest and inconsistent benefits. Using cross-sectoral simulations from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, we find that higher resolution substantially improves model skill in temperature-sensitive impact models and topographically complex regions, whereas precipitation-driven and low-relief systems show weaker and less systematic improvements. For temperature, both climate inputs and model outputs improve most strongly at the 60 km to 10 km transition, with diminishing gains at finer scales; for precipitation, some models even exhibit reduced performance beyond 10 km. These results highlight that optimal resolution depends on sectoral and regional context, and point to the need for improving model process representation and downscaling techniques so that added spatial detail translates into meaningful skill gains. For data providers, this implies prioritizing resolutions that maximize improvements where they matter most, while for modelling groups and users it underscores the need for explicit benchmarking of resolution choices in climate impact assessments."}

This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($α$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase.

DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through an embedded differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN successfully produces a feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. Moreover, the embedded OPF layer enables DA-DNN to generalize to untrained system configurations, such as changes in line flow limits.

The exact regime of Markov chain is accessible, whereas the system state can only be partially observed. A separation principle is established, showing that the estimate and control procedures can be separated and implemented independently. It extends the classical separation principle to conditional mean-field system. Utilizing two sets of Riccati equations and a set of first-order ordinary differential equations, we derive the feedback representation of the optimal control. To illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results, two applications with numerical simulations are provided, including a one-dimensional LQ example and a coupled electrical machines control problem."}

Standard formulations, such as hybrid or SLEVE coordinates, mitigate these errors by using analytic decay functions controlled by heuristic scale parameters that are typically tuned by hand and fixed a priori. In this work, we propose a framework to define a parametric vertical coordinate system as a learnable component within a differentiable dynamical core. We develop an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver for the two-dimensional non-hydrostatic Euler equations on an Arakawa C-grid, and introduce a NEUral Vertical Enhancement (NEUVE) terrain-following coordinate based on an integral transformed neural network that guarantees monotonicity. A key feature of our approach is the use of automatic differentiation to compute exact geometric metric terms, thereby eliminating truncation errors associated with finite-difference coordinate derivatives. By coupling simulation errors through the time integration to the parameterization, our formulation finds a grid structure optimized for both the underlying physics and numerics. Using several standard tests, we demonstrate that these learned coordinates reduce the mean squared error by a factor of 1.4 to 2 in non-linear statistical benchmarks, and eliminate spurious vertical velocity striations over steep topography."}

In this work, we perform a comparative study of the phononic and electronic Raman responses of high-quality ML-TL single crystals and contrast them with those of other RP nickelates, using samples with optimized oxygen content. We establish several Raman spectral features that enable unambiguous phase identification across the series.

The controller architecture aims to measure the interlayer temperature by a laterally positioned thermal camera and maintain a preset reference temperature by switching between the heating mode through dynamic laser power adjustment and the cooling mode by assigning interlayer dwell time to allow cooling between layers. The switching controller employs a feedback optimization control algorithm for the heating mode to adjust the laser power, and a triggering algorithm that increases the interlayer dwell time until the interlayer temperature reaches the reference value. Additionally, the study compares the performance of the proposed controller in both supported and unsupported overhanging parts to evaluate the effect of support structures on the controller performance as well as the thermal behavior of overhanging parts. Results demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in stabilizing interlayer temperature across varying cross-sectional areas while remaining within the material's stable processing zone. In the heating mode, the controller efficiently stabilizes temperature, even in geometries with significant cross-section variation. The study also identifies trade-offs among process efficiency, energy consumption, and build time. Supported parts exhibit reduced overheating but consume more energy and material, while unsupported parts stabilize interlayer temperature faster but with longer build times due to increased dwell time assignments. The research highlights notable improvements in interlayer temperature control for geometries prone to excessive thermal stresses. Moreover, the introduction of interlayer dwell time offers a practical solution to maintaining thermal stability in complex geometries."}

We evaluated the widely used Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm and the newer Maximum a Posteriori approach with Entropy prior (MAP-Ent) approach in the context of quantifying radiopharmaceutical uptake in pathological lesions. Numerical experiments were performed using a digital twin of the standardized NEMA IEC phantom, which contains six spheres of varying diameters to simulate lesions. Quantitative accuracy was assessed using the maximum recovery coefficient (RCmax), defined as the ratio of the reconstructed maximum activity to the true value. The study shows that OSEM exhibits unstable convergence during iterations, leading to noise and edge artifacts in lesion images. Post-filtering stabilizes the reconstruction and ensures convergence, producing RCmax-size curves that could be used as correction factors in clinical evaluations. However, this approach significantly underestimates uptake in small lesions and may even lead to the complete loss of small lesions on reconstructed images. In contrast, MAP-Ent demonstrates fundamentally different behavior: it achieves stable convergence and preserves quantitative accuracy without post-filtering, while maintaining the contrast of even the smallest lesions. However, the iteration number at which accurate reconstruction is achieved depends strongly on the choice of a single global regularization parameter, which limits optimal performance across lesions of different sizes. These results demonstrate the need for locally adaptive regularization in MAP-Ent to improve quantitative accuracy in lesion reconstruction."}

In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case.

The UAV is supposed to fly along a periodical circular trajectory at a fixed height for ISAC service supply from the sky. We consider on-demand sensing services, where on-demand detection and on-demand localization requests may be activated at any time toward any position within the targeted serving region. While guaranteeing satisfactory accuracy for both on-demand sensing tasks, we aim at maximizing the minimum achievable throughput among all communication users, via joint optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication user scheduling. To address the complicated problem with infinite sensing constraints, we characterize the on-demand detection constraint as a restricted deployment area for UAV and the on-demand localization constraint as Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints over finite reference target points, based on which the original problem is simplified to more tractable one. Afterwards, particularly aiming to ensure no violations of CRB constraints, we propose a convex approximation for the reformulated problem, where tight approximation is guaranteed at given local solution. The construction strategy for convex problem approximation allows an efficient iterative algorithm with verified convergence to a superior suboptimal solution. At last, with simulations, we verified the applicability of our developed optimization scheme in strictly fulfilling the on-demand sensing constraints and the effectiveness of our proposed solution for simultaneously enhancing the communication throughput in UAV-enabled ISAC."}

In this approach, the physical domain is represented independently from the computational mesh, allowing the latter to be generated more easily compared with body-fitted meshes. While this facilitates the treatment of complex geometries, it also introduces challenges, such as ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix caused by small cut elements and difficulties in accurately enforcing boundary conditions. A recently proposed technique to address these issues is the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM), which represents the computational domain solely through uncut elements and enforces boundary conditions via a Taylor expansion from a surrogate boundary to the true boundary. Previous studies have shown that, for Neumann boundary conditions, the flux evaluation requires additional derivatives in the Taylor expansion, effectively reducing the order of convergence by one. In this work, we investigate for the first time the performance of SBM combined with Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) under various local refinement strategies. In particular, we propose local p- and k-refinement schemes for THB-splines and compare them with local h-refinement and the unmodified SBM. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced shift operator that incorporates mixed partial derivatives, in contrast to the standard operator. The study assesses accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency for benchmark problems on trimmed domains. The results highlight how different refinement strategies affect convergence behavior in trimmed IGA formulations using SBM and demonstrate that targeted degree elevation can mitigate the Neumann boundary limitations of the standard method."}

Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications."}

This report examines a rural Swiss case study to explore the techno-economic implications of CELs for both participants and the local DSO. The findings indicate that CELs can enhance the local use of renewable generation, particularly photovoltaics, and offer modest financial gains, with outcomes strongly shaped by community size, composition, and tariff design. Larger and more heterogeneous communities achieve better internal matching of supply and demand, though the overall incentive remains limited because the tariff reduction applies only to distribution charges. The study further shows that internal energy exchange is maximized when local PV generation covers roughly 1-2 times the community load. For DSOs, CELs reduce grid imports (27-46%), resulting in a substantial reduction in distribution tariff revenues (17-36%), necessitating regulatory adaptation. While centralized batteries provide economic value to members, their technical impact on the grid remains modest due to their small, economically optimized capacity. Larger centralized storage is shown to reduce transformer peak power, but risks increasing line loading, suggesting a need for careful sizing and placement."}

Here we present a theoretical demonstration that a topological $d+id$ fractionalized superconducting phase (SC*) can emerge in the weak-coupling limit of a Kondo lattice model, where conduction electrons interact with a Yao-Lee spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice (the Yao-Lee-Kondo model). Using a renormalization-group analysis, we show that exchanging Majorana spinons from the Yao-Lee spin liquid generates effective interactions among the conduction electrons and drives a Cooper instability even for arbitrarily weak Kondo coupling. We further find that the induced leading inter-orbital antiferromagnetic interaction selects topological $d+id$ spin-singlet pairing with Chern number $C=\\pm 2$. Meanwhile, the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee spin liquid remain gapless and deconfined in this regime, so the resulting state is a fractionalized topological $d+id$ superconductor (SC*). For sufficiently strong Kondo coupling, the system instead enters a heavy Fermi liquid phase with fractionalization (HFL*)."}

The framework consists of 2 partitions. One is designated for the rehabilitation device based on ultra-low power spiking networks deployed on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. The other resides on stationary hardware that can accommodate computationally intensive hardware for fine-tuning on a per-patient basis. By maintaining a communication channel between both the modules and splitting the algorithm components, the power and latency requirements of the movable system have been optimised, while retaining the learning performance advantages of compute- and power-hungry hardware on the stationary machine. As part of the framework, we propose (a) the split machine learning processes for efficiency in architectural utilisation, and (b) task-specific temporal optimisations to lower edge-inference control latency. This paper evaluates the proposed methods on a reference stepper motor-based shoulder exercise. Overall, these methods offer comparable performance uplifts over the State-of-the-art for neuromorphic deployment, while achieving over 60% savings in both power and latency during inference compared to standard implementations."}

The heavy-fermion quasiparticle is a bound state of a U(1) matter field carrying unit electric and U(1) gauge charge, and the fermionic parton. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify two symmetry-equivalent regimes: a heavy-fermion metal with a sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust low-frequency transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with an incoherent resonance and vanishing low-frequency transport. For any finite lattice extent in the direction perpendicular to the chain, the Luttinger volume of the heavy-fermion phase counts both composite and conduction electrons, while in the Kondo-breakdown phase it counts only the conduction electrons.

Integrating both, gravitational and gauge degrees of freedom in $3+1$ dimensions may be obtained upon dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional emergent gravity. To this end, we show that entangled systems of two and three qubits can be associated with $5+1$ and $9+1$ dimensional spacetimes respectively, which are reduced to $3+1$ dimensions upon singling out a preferred complex direction. In the latter case, this reduction is invariant under a residual $SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1) /\\mathbb{Z}_6$ symmetry, the Standard Model gauge group.

The rates are controlled by the spectrum of the covariance operator of the measure that defines the error metric. Our setup is very general and allows for measures with unbounded support. A key implication is a curse of sample complexity which shows that the minimax risk for generic Lipschitz operators cannot decay at any algebraic rate in the sample size.

Furthermore, using the Heisenberg equation, another system of Bloch vector equations is derived, which forms an Euler-Poinsot system, as is commonly encountered in the theory of torque-free spinning tops. This is used to prove the Liouville integrability of the corresponding Hamilton equations of motion, whereby formal connections to the Neumann model of classical Hamiltonian dynamics and the Hamiltonian Euler-Poinsot model are drawn to identify the first integrals of motion. Within the same framework, stability criteria for quantum dynamics are then derived which correspond to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion resp. other criteria following from the Energy-Casimir method of classical Newtonian mechanics. Following that, specific solutions to the equations of motion are constructed that encode the complex dynamics of composite quantum systems. Eventually, to show that this formalism provides concrete physical predictions, an analogue of the intermediate axis theorem is derived and the effect of oscillating entanglement is discussed.

Crucially, the dynamic and nonreciprocal nature of the bus provides signal gain and intrinsic isolation that simultaneously suppresses Purcell decay, enhancing T1 times across all distinct-frequency qubits, and reduces coherent crosstalk by more than two orders of magnitude. The spatiotemporal modulation enables parametric frequency multiplication and creates wave-propagation dynamics analogous to cosmological expansion, with observed redshift-like broadening and deceleration of magnetic-field wavepackets. Theoretical modeling based on a non-Markovian master equation confirms that the engineered memory kernel extends coherence while reshaping the noise spectrum. Full error-budget analysis shows that the architecture maintains gate errors below the fault-tolerance threshold for arrays exceeding 25 qubits, converting a crosstalk-dominated error budget into one limited by intrinsic material coherence. This integrated, frequency-multiplexed, and nonreciprocal control bus therefore offers a path toward unprecedented I/O simplification, noise resilience, and scalable high-coherence quantum processin"}

Here we introduce an inseparability criterion that exposes non-Gaussian entanglement that escapes covariance-based criteria by incorporating higher-order quadrature cumulants. The criterion extends Gaussian theory without requiring full state tomography and can be evaluated directly from homodyne and heterodyne data and is possible to extend to arbitrary superpositions of Fock states in two modes.

While continuum limits of two state quantum walks are well established, an explicit continuous spacetime formulation for the lazy three state walk, particularly including noise, has not previously been constructed. Using an SU(3) representation of a Grover type coin together with a Lindblad formulation of decoherence acting either on the coin or the spatial subspace, we systematically expand the discrete dynamics in both space and time to obtain continuum master equations governing the coarse grained evolution. The resulting generators yield a genuine partial differential equation description of the walk, going beyond purely probabilistic or spectral correspondences. We show that the unitary limit is governed by a Dirac-type SU(3) Hamiltonian describing ballistic advection of left and right moving modes coupled by local symmetric mixing, with the rest state acting as an additional internal degree of freedom. Coin dephasing selectively damps internal coherences while preserving coherent spatial transport, whereas spatial dephasing suppresses long range spatial interference and rapidly drives the dynamics toward classical behaviour. This continuum framework clarifies how internal symmetry, rest state coupling, and distinct decoherence channels shape large scale transport in lazy open quantum walks, and provides a foundation for future extensions toward multichannel quantum transport models and quantum-inspired algorithms."}

To characterize the resulting state, we use a single-shot f-2f interferometer to sample its Husimi function. We observe a clear transformation from a 2D Gaussian distribution to an 'S'-shaped non-Gaussian profile, which is the direct statistical evidence of the intensity-dependent nonlinear phase. The negativity of the Wigner function, which is an intrinsic property of any pure non-Gaussian state, cannot be observed because BSV is a mixed state even under minute optical loss.

Our proposal draws inspiration from Dennett's notion of a \"compression algorithm\" as a defining criterion of a scientific theory. On this basis, we separate realism from ontological commitment.

We develop a two-state framework that embeds coarse-grained left/right statistics of the driven Duffing oscillator into a $2\\times2$ density-matrix representation and models inter-well switching by a two-rate Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) generator. For diagonal states the GKSL dynamics reduces to the classical two-state master equation.The density-matrix language permits an operational ``Bloch half-disk'' embedding with overlap parameter $c(\\varepsilon)$ quantifying partition fuzziness; the GKSL model is fitted to diagonal marginals treating $c(\\varepsilon)$ as diagnostic. We derive closed-form solutions, an explicit Kraus representation (generalized amplitude damping with dephasing and rotation), and practical diagnostics for the time-homogeneous first-order Markov assumption (order tests, Chapman--Kolmogorov consistency, run-length statistics, stationarity checks). When higher-order memory appears, we extend the framework via augmented Markov models, constructing CPTP maps through discrete-time Kraus representations; continuous-time GKSL generators may not exist for all empirical transition matrices. We provide a numerical pipeline with templates for validating the framework on Duffing simulations. The density-matrix formalism is an organizational convenience rather than claiming quantum-classical equivalence."}

As a paradigmatic example, we consider the quantum Ising chain in the presence of homogeneous transverse ($g$) and longitudinal ($h$) magnetic fields. This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g<g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i < 0$ to a positive value $h_f>0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian ${\\hat H}(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics for different values of $g$, finding qualitatively distinct behaviors for $g > g_c$ (where the chain is in the disordered phase), for $g = g_c$ (QQ across the CQT), and for $g<g_c$ (QQ across the FOQT line)."}
