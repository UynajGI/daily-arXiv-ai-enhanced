While first-order methods possess a low per-iteration cost, their convergence is slow for ill-conditioned problems. Stochastic Newton methods utilize second-order information to correct for local curvature, but the O(d 3 ) per-iteration cost of computing and inverting a full Hessian, where d is the problem dimension, is prohibitive in high dimensions. This paper introduces an online mini-batch stochastic Newton algorithm. The method employs a random masking strategy that selects a subset of Hessian columns at each iteration, substantially reducing the per-step computational cost. This approach allows the algorithm, in the mini-batch setting, to achieve a total computational cost for a single pass over N data points of O(N d), which is comparable to first-order methods while retaining the advantages of second-order information. We establish the almost sure convergence and asymptotic efficiency of the resulting estimator. This property is obtained without requiring iterate averaging, which distinguishes this work from prior analyses."}

Our active soft-impact oscillator model couples a non-smooth soft-impact force to the Lorenz-like dynamics arising from the wave-particle entity. Theoretical and numerical exploration of the full parameter space reveals a wide variety of nonlinear behaviors and bifurcations driven by impact and grazing events. These include grazing-induced and impact-induced transitions between periodic and chaotic motion, as well as grazing-mediated attractor switching and impact-free (invisible) attractor switching.

Extending a previously studied heterogeneous Markov ensemble, we incorporate correlations between forward and backward transition rates through a single asymmetry parameter $γ$, while heterogeneity is controlled by $ε$. Using results from random matrix theory, we identify a critical locus $ε_c(γ,N)$ at which relaxation times diverge and spectral universality breaks down. We characterize the behavior of entropy production, predictive information, and relaxation dynamics across the ensemble, showing that many observables depend strongly on heterogeneity but only weakly on asymmetry, except near the symmetric limit. Applying maximum-likelihood inference to human fMRI and EEG data, we find that both modalities operate near the predicted critical locus and occupy a similar region of the $ε-γ$ plane, supporting a super-universality of human brain dynamics. While ensemble averages are well captured by the null model, empirical data exhibit substantially enhanced variability, indicating subject-specific structure beyond random expectations.

Submitted to IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis", "summary": "We propose a new and simplified multiscale time integrator Fourier pseudospectral (MTI-FP) method for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter epsilon in (0,1] inversely proportional to the speed of light, and establish its uniform first-order accuracy in time in the nonrelativistic regime, i.e. 0 < epsilon << 1. In this regime, the solution of the NKGE is highly oscillatory in time with O(epsilon^2)-wavelength, which brings significant difficulties in designing uniformly accurate numerical methods. The MTI-FP is based on (i) a multiscale decomposition by frequency of the NKGE in each time interval with simplified transmission conditions, and (ii) an exponential wave integrator for temporal discretization and a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization. By adapting the energy method and the mathematical induction, we obtain two error bounds in H1-norm at O(h^{m0}+tau^2/epsilon^2) and O(h^{m0}+tau+epsilon^2) with mesh size h, time step tau and m0 an integer dependent on the regularity of the solution, which immediately implies a uniformly accurate error bound O(h^{m0}+tau) with respect to epsilon in (0,1]. In addition, by adopting a linear interpolation of the micro variables with the multiscale decomposition in each time interval, we obtain a uniformly accurate numerical solution for any time t larger than zero. Thus the proposed MTI-FP method has a super resolution property in time in terms of the Shannon sampling theory, i.e. accurate numerical solutions can be obtained even when the time step is much bigger than the O(epsilon^2)-wavelength. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds and demonstrate their super resolution in time. Finally the proposed MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically convergence rates of the NKGE to its different limiting models in the nonrelativistic regime."}

We find that requests disproportionately target highly visible posts - those with more views and engagement and authored by influential accounts - whereas fact-checks are distributed more broadly across languages, sentiments, and topics. Using a quasi-experimental survival analysis, we further estimate the effect of displaying requests on subsequent note creation. Results show that requests significantly accelerate contributions from Top Writers. Altogether, our findings highlight a gap between the content that attracts requests for fact-checking and the content that ultimately receives fact-checks, while showing that user requests can steer contributors toward greater alignment.

Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance.

These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states."}

We address this challenge using century-long (1900-2010), large-ensemble simulations with two computationally efficient deep-learning general circulation models. We find these models skillfully reproduce the observed blocking climatology, matching or exceeding the performance of a traditional high-resolution model and representative CMIP6 models. Averaging the large ensembles filters internal atmospheric noise to isolate the SST-forced component of blocking variability, yielding substantially higher correlations with reanalysis than for individual ensemble members. We identify robust teleconnections linking Greenland blocking frequency to North Atlantic SST and El Niño-like patterns. Furthermore, SST-forced trends in blocking frequency show a consistent decline in winter over Greenland, and an increase over Europe. These results demonstrate that SST variability exerts a significant and physically interpretable influence on blocking frequency and establishes large ensembles from deep learning models as a powerful tool for separating forced SST signals from internal noise."}

After a comprehensive collection and filtering process, we obtained 2588 cleaned and standardized seismic sections from 122 survey areas, covering a wide range of vertical and horizontal sampling characteristics.

As a result, our tool scales to distance 17 for a physical error rate of 0.0005 with a two-hour time budget on a desktop. For this case, it estimated a logical error rate of $1.51 \\times 10^{-11}$ with high confidence."}

While modern data-driven machine learning techniques have proven highly effective in establishing structure-property correlations, many models are criticized for lacking physical interpretability and being task-specific. In this work, we identify an approximate linear relation between structure profiles and disorder-induced responses of glass properties based on first order perturbation theory. We analytically demonstrate that this relationship holds universally across glassy systems with varying dimensions and distinct interaction types. This robust theoretical relationship motivates the adoption of linear machine learning models, which we show numerically to achieve surprisingly high predictive accuracy for structure-property mapping in a wide variety of glassy materials. We further devise regularization analysis to further enhance the interpretability of our model, bridging the gap between predictive performance and physical insight. Overall, this linear relation establishes a simple yet powerful connection between structural disorder and spectral properties in glasses, opening a new avenue for advancing their studies."}

Our method is based on a Galerkin discretisation of the Lippmann-Schwinger volume integral equation, using a discontinuous piecewise-polynomial approximation space on a geometry-conforming mesh comprising elements which themselves have fractal boundary. We first provide a semi-discrete well-posedness and error analysis for both the $h$- and $p$-versions of our method for completely arbitrary inhomogeneities (without any regularity assumption on the boundary of the inhomogeneity or of the mesh elements). We prove convergence estimates for the integral equation solution and superconvergence estimates for linear functionals such as scattered field and far-field pattern evaluations, and elucidate how the regularity of the inhomogeneity boundary and the regularity of the refractive index affect the rates of convergence predicted. We then specialise to the case where the inhomogeneity is an ``$n$-attractor'', i.e.\\ the fractal attractor of an iterated function system satisfying the open set condition with non-empty interior, showing how in this case the self-similarity of the inhomogeneity can be used to generate geometry-conforming meshes. For the $h$-version with piecewise constant approximation we also present singular quadrature rules, supported by a fully discrete error analysis, permitting practical implementation of our method. We present numerical results for two-dimensional examples, which validate our theoretical results and show that our method is significantly more accurate than a comparable method involving replacement of the fractal inhomogeneity by a smoother prefractal approximation."}

The social cost of such adaptive behaviors and their impact on the contagion dynamics have been investigated in pairwise networks, with binary interactions driving both contagion and risk perception. However, contagion and adaptive mechanisms can also be driven by group (higher-order) interactions. Here, we consider several adaptive behaviors triggered by awareness of risk perceived through higher-order and pairwise interactions, and we compare their impact on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes. By numerical simulations and a mean-field analytic approach, we show that adaptive behaviors driven by higher-order information are more effective in limiting the spread of a contagion, than similar mechanisms based on pairwise information. Meanwhile, they also entail a lower social cost, measured as the reduction of the intensity of interactions in the population. Indeed, adaptive mechanisms based on higher-order information lead to a heterogeneous risk perception within the population, producing a higher alert on nodes with large hyperdegree (i.e., participating in many groups), on their neighborhoods, and on large groups. This in turn prevents the spreading process to exploit the properties of these nodes and groups, which tend to drive and sustain the dynamics in the absence of adaptive behaviors."}

While asymmetric IR transmission at a specific incidence angle -- typically normal incidence -- is often emphasized, we show that such single-angle asymmetry is neither sufficient nor predictive of practical cooling performance. In this work, we demonstrate that effective non-contact PRC requires angularly distributed asymmetric IR transparency evaluated through hemispherical integration over emission directions, rather than asymmetry at a single incidence angle. To quantify this effect, an angle-resolved full-wave electromagnetic (EM) model with Bloch periodic boundary conditions and Floquet mode decomposition is employed to compute wavelength- and angle-dependent bidirectional reflection and transmission of periodic PRC structures. The resulting EM response is coupled to an energy-balance-based thermal model to predict the transient temperature evolution of the cooling object. By comparing models that account for the full angular distribution with normal-incidence-only approximations, we show that pronounced asymmetric transmission at normal incidence is generally not preserved at oblique angles. As a result, angular integration yields only marginal cooling or may even result in net heating, whereas normal-incidence-based models can substantially overestimate cooling performance. These results establish angularly distributed asymmetric transparency as a key EM design principle for IR-transparent PRC and wide-angle asymmetric metasurfaces."}

In such settings, treatment may have distinct effects on (1) the probability of being cured and (2) the event timing among non-cured individuals. Standard survival analysis and causal inference methods typically do not separate cured from non-cured individuals, obscuring distinct treatment mechanisms on cure probability and event timing. To address these challenges, we propose a matching-based framework that constructs distinct match groups to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) on cure probability and event timing, respectively. We use mixture cure models to identify feature importance for both estimands, which in turn informs weighted distance metrics for matching in high-dimensional spaces. Within matched groups, Kaplan-Meier estimators provide estimates of cure probability and expected time to event, from which individual-level treatment effects are derived. We provide theoretical guarantees for estimator consistency and distance metric optimality under an equal-scale constraint. We further decompose estimation error into contributions from censoring, model fitting, and irreducible noise. Simulations and real-world data analyses demonstrate that our approach delivers interpretable and robust HTE estimates in time-to-event settings."}

Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference.

The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations.

We combine results from queuing theory with those from search processes with stochastic resetting in a bounded domain to obtain regions of the parameter space of the search process that ensure convergence of the number of resources in the queue to a steady state. Furthermore, we find a threshold resetting rate at which the effects of stochastic resetting shift from reducing convergence regions to expanding them. Finally, we demonstrate that this threshold value grows exponentially with the number of servers, making it harder for stochastic resetting to improve the convergence of the queueing system."}

This constraint is most apparent in melting systems, where temperature remains pinned despite continued energy input.

We show that energy conservation alone enforces a rigorous duality between the total latent heat dissipated during phase change and the accumulated exceedance of the latent temperature above the melting point. This duality is mathematically equivalent to the one-dimensional Wasserstein-1 distance between the latent and observed temperature trajectories, with the transport cost set by a characteristic surface dissipation timescale and melting energy. Applied to ice-sheet surface melting, this timescale admits a direct physical interpretation in terms of radiative and turbulent heat loss. The same framework yields a first-principles derivation of the empirical Positive Degree Day law and predicts realistic degree-day factors that emerge from surface energy balance, without ad hoc calibration. More broadly, phase change emerges as an optimal transport process that projects continuous energetic variability onto a constrained thermodynamic boundary."}

However, simply comparing predictions to observations is insufficient for understanding the global landscape of model behavior. This is especially true for many deep learning models, whose structures are complex. Further, in risk-averse operational settings, water managers require models that are trustworthy and provably safe, as non-robustness can put our critical infrastructure at risk. Motivated by the need to select reliable models for operational deployment, we introduce and explore adversarial robustness analysis in hydrological modeling, evaluating whether small, targeted perturbations to meteorological forcings induce substantial changes in simulated discharge. We compare physical-conceptual and deep learning-based hydrological models across 1,347 German catchments under perturbations of varying magnitudes, using the fast gradient sign method (FGSM). We find that, as expected, the FGSM perturbations systematically reduce KGE and increase MSE. However, catastrophic failure is rare and, surprisingly, LSTMs generally demonstrate greater robustness than HBV models. Further, changes in both the predicted hydrographs and the internal model states often respond approximately linearly (at least locally) as perturbation size increases, providing a compact summary of how errors grow under such perturbations. Similar patterns are also observed for random perturbations, suggesting that small input changes usually introduce approximately proportional changes in model output. Overall, these findings support further consideration of LSTMs for operational deployment (due both to their predictive power and robustness), and motivate future work on both characterizing model responses to input changes and improving robustness through architectural modifications and training design."}

Using a dual-simulation approach -- a computationally efficient deterministic mean-field model and a high-fidelity particle-based stochastic model (Smoldyn) -- we show that tuning the channel's underlying biophysical parameters, such as ligand-receptor kinetics and diffusion dynamics, allows the reservoir to be optimized for distinct classes of computation. We employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently navigate this high-dimensional parameter space, identifying discrete operational regimes. Our results reveal a clear trade-off: parameter sets rich in channel memory excel at chaotic time-series forecasting tasks (e.g., Mackey Glass), while regimes that promote strong receptor nonlinearity are superior for nonlinear data transformation. We further demonstrate that post-processing methods improve the performance of the stochastic reservoir by mitigating intrinsic molecular noise. These findings establish the MC channel not merely as a computational substrate, but as a design blueprint for tunable, bioinspired computing systems, providing a clear optimization framework for future wetware AI implementations."}

These include relative speed, visual looming, remaining distance, and directional collision risk proximity (CRP) measures. Results suggest that some of these variables may meaningfully influence movement adjustments, although predictive performance remains moderate. Marginal effects and elasticities indicate strong directional asymmetries in risk perception, with frontal and rear CRP showing opposite influences. The remaining distance exhibits a possible mid-crossing threshold. Relative speed cues appear to have a comparatively less effect.

This paper introduces a flexible Koopman autoencoder formulation that incorporates meteorological forcings and boundary conditions, and systematically compares its performance against POD-based surrogates. The Koopman autoencoder employs a learned linear temporal operator in latent space, enabling eigenvalue regularization to promote temporal stability. This strategy is evaluated alongside temporal unrolling techniques for achieving stable and accurate long-term predictions. The models are assessed on three test cases spanning distinct dynamical regimes, with prediction horizons up to one year at 30-minute temporal resolution. Across all cases, the Koopman autoencoder with temporal unrolling yields the best overall accuracy compared to the POD-based surrogates, achieving relative root-mean-squared-errors of 0.01-0.13 and $R^2$-values of 0.65-0.996. Prediction errors are largest for current velocities, and smallest for water surface elevations. Comparing to in-situ observations, the surrogate yields -0.65% to 12% change in water surface elevation prediction error when compared to prediction errors of the physics-based model. These error levels, corresponding to a few centimeters, are acceptable for many practical applications, while inference speed-ups of 300-1400x enables workflows such as ensemble forecasting and long climate simulations for coastal-ocean modelling."}

Maximizing the quantum Fisher information is essential for achieving the optimal estimation precision of quantum sensors. A typical quantum sensor involves a qubit(e.g. a spin-1/2) probe undergoing an unknown rotation, here the unknown rotation angle is the parameter to be estimated. A well known limitation is that if the rotation axis is unknown, the maximal quantum Fisher information is impossible to attain. This limitation has been lifted recently by leveraging entanglement between the probe qubit and an ancilla qubit. Namely, through measurement of the ancilla after the axis is revealed, one can prepare the probe that is optimal for any unknown rotation axis. This proposal, however, works only for a spin-1/2. Considering large spin probes can achieve a larger quantum Fisher information, offering enhanced metrological advantage, we here utilize the entanglement between a large spin probe and an ancilla to achieve optimal quantum Fisher information for estimating the rotation angle, without prior knowledge of the rotation axis. Different from the previous spin-1/2 case, achieving the optimal precision with large spins generally requires post-selection, resulting in a success probability dependent on the dimension of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we extend the encoding state from the maximally entangled case to general entangled states, showing that optimal metrology can still be achieved with a certain success probability."}

In life testing, immediate failures result in zero lifetimes, often due to defects or poor quality, especially in electronics and clinical trials. These failures, called inliers at zero, are difficult to model using standard approaches. The presence and proportion of inliers may influence the accuracy of extreme value analysis, bias parameter estimates, or even lead to severe events or extreme effects, such as drought or crop failure. In such scenarios, a key issue in extreme value analysis is determining a suitable threshold to capture tail behaviour accurately. Although some extreme value mixture models address threshold and tail estimation, they often inadequately handle inliers, resulting in suboptimal results. Bulk model misspecification can affect the threshold, extreme value estimates, and, in particular, the tail proportion. There is no unified framework for defining extreme value mixture models, especially the tail proportion. This paper proposes a flexible model that handles extremes, inliers, and the tail proportion. Parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. Compared the proposed model estimates with the classical mean excess plot, parameter stability plot, and Pickands plot estimates.

In the weak-disorder limit, we show that the infrared structure of the two-point correlation functions yields a decomposition of the physical field into correlated components with distinct scaling dimensions. This mechanism exhibits the characteristic $1/p^4$ behavior, which shifts the upper critical dimension to $d_c^{+}=6$. The universal critical behavior of the RFIM near this dimension is governed by a minimal infrared effective action.

We study distribution-level voltage regulation enabled by flexibility in LLM inference, using batch size as a control knob that trades off the voltage impacts of GPU power consumption against inference latency and token throughput. We first formulate this problem as an optimization problem and then realize it as an online feedback optimization controller that leverages measurements from both the power grid and GPU systems. Our key insight is that reducing GPU power consumption alleviates violations of lower voltage limits, while increasing GPU power mitigates violations near upper voltage limits in distribution systems; this runs counter to the common belief that minimizing GPU power consumption is always beneficial to power grids."}

However, as a collision kernel, it dose not guarantee the entrinsic detailed balance and is not integrable. In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution. Base on the same elementary moment (integral) of collision operator, the macroscopic transport coefficients is found in Chapman-Enskog framework. The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated. When thermal equilibrium is enforced, the present thermal conduction coefficients can be degenerated to the famous results of Mason and Monchick. Given the correct relaxation rate, a Rykov-type novel relaxation model for Pullin equation is proposed. It can recover the interaction of transaltional and rotatioanl heat fluxes in relaxation process, which is ignored in the widely used Rykov equation. Finally, the precision of this new Rykov-type equation is examined using a series of benchmark test cases."}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest forecast reconciliation problem, and perhaps on-par with the largest constrained least-squares-problem ever solved. We also make several theoretical contributions. We show that for a restricted class of problems and when the loss function is weighted appropriately, least-squares forecast reconciliation is equivalent to share-based forecast reconciliation.

Critical exponents define these classes, with the Ising model being the outstanding prototype that elucidates the differences from the mean-field category, believed to be valid above a critical dimension only. Here, in apparent striking contradiction to the Ising universality class, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of a finite Ising system of $N$ spins in $d = 3$ obeys mean-field Landau theory in the vicinity of its critical point, with classical critical exponents. Yet, when expressed in terms of the linear size $L$ of the system, the free energy unveils its proper finite-size scaling form, from which the thermodynamic limit critical temperature $T_c$ and the Ising critical exponents $ν$, $γ$ and $β$ can be identified. We find that the larger the size $L$, the smaller the mean-field region, shrinking to zero in the thermodynamic limit. These conclusions are achieved via the use of an alternative approach to collect data from a Monte Carlo simulation of a three-dimensional Ising model that allows for the evaluation of the free energy per spin $f = f(T,m;L)$ and of the coexistence curve, or spontaneous magnetization at zero magnetic field, $m_{\\rm coex} = m(T;L)$ as functions of temperature $T$ and magnetization per spin $m = M/N$.

This paper introduces a flexible Koopman autoencoder formulation that incorporates meteorological forcings and boundary conditions, and systematically compares its performance against POD-based surrogates. The Koopman autoencoder employs a learned linear temporal operator in latent space, enabling eigenvalue regularization to promote temporal stability. This strategy is evaluated alongside temporal unrolling techniques for achieving stable and accurate long-term predictions. The models are assessed on three test cases spanning distinct dynamical regimes, with prediction horizons up to one year at 30-minute temporal resolution. Across all cases, the Koopman autoencoder with temporal unrolling yields the best overall accuracy compared to the POD-based surrogates, achieving relative root-mean-squared-errors of 0.01-0.13 and $R^2$-values of 0.65-0.996. Prediction errors are largest for current velocities, and smallest for water surface elevations. Comparing to in-situ observations, the surrogate yields -0.65% to 12% change in water surface elevation prediction error when compared to prediction errors of the physics-based model. These error levels, corresponding to a few centimeters, are acceptable for many practical applications, while inference speed-ups of 300-1400x enables workflows such as ensemble forecasting and long climate simulations for coastal-ocean modelling."}

We address this challenge using century-long (1900-2010), large-ensemble simulations with two computationally efficient deep-learning general circulation models. We find these models skillfully reproduce the observed blocking climatology, matching or exceeding the performance of a traditional high-resolution model and representative CMIP6 models. Averaging the large ensembles filters internal atmospheric noise to isolate the SST-forced component of blocking variability, yielding substantially higher correlations with reanalysis than for individual ensemble members. We identify robust teleconnections linking Greenland blocking frequency to North Atlantic SST and El Niño-like patterns. Furthermore, SST-forced trends in blocking frequency show a consistent decline in winter over Greenland, and an increase over Europe. These results demonstrate that SST variability exerts a significant and physically interpretable influence on blocking frequency and establishes large ensembles from deep learning models as a powerful tool for separating forced SST signals from internal noise."}

This challenge is exacerbated in the distributed quantum computing regime, where quantum networks introduce additional communication-induced noise.

We investigate ZNE in this setting by comparing Global optimization (ZNE is applied prior to circuit partitioning), against Local optimization (ZNE is applied independently to each sub-circuit). Partitioning is performed on a monolithic circuit, which is then transformed into a distributed implementation by inserting noisy teleportation-based communication primitives between sub-circuits. We evaluate both approaches across varying numbers of quantum processing units (QPUs) and under heterogeneous local and network noise conditions. Our results demonstrate that Global ZNE exhibits superior scalability, achieving error reductions of up to $48\\%$ across six QPUs. Moreover, we observe counterintuitive noise behavior, where increasing the number of QPUs improves mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication overhead.

The social cost of such adaptive behaviors and their impact on the contagion dynamics have been investigated in pairwise networks, with binary interactions driving both contagion and risk perception. However, contagion and adaptive mechanisms can also be driven by group (higher-order) interactions. Here, we consider several adaptive behaviors triggered by awareness of risk perceived through higher-order and pairwise interactions, and we compare their impact on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes. By numerical simulations and a mean-field analytic approach, we show that adaptive behaviors driven by higher-order information are more effective in limiting the spread of a contagion, than similar mechanisms based on pairwise information. Meanwhile, they also entail a lower social cost, measured as the reduction of the intensity of interactions in the population. Indeed, adaptive mechanisms based on higher-order information lead to a heterogeneous risk perception within the population, producing a higher alert on nodes with large hyperdegree (i.e., participating in many groups), on their neighborhoods, and on large groups. This in turn prevents the spreading process to exploit the properties of these nodes and groups, which tend to drive and sustain the dynamics in the absence of adaptive behaviors."}

Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG.

We show that inverse propensity score weighting (IPW) with a random effects propensity score model -- the current standard in the literature -- targets only global balance and constant level shifts across clusters, but imposes no constraints on local balance. We then present two approaches that target both forms of balance. First, hierarchical balancing weights directly control global and local balance through a constrained optimization problem. Second, building on the recently proposed Generalized Mundlak approach, we develop a novel Mundlak balancing weights estimator that adjusts for cluster-level sufficient statistics rather than cluster indicators; this approach can accommodate small clusters where all units are treated or untreated. Critically, these approaches rest on different assumptions: hierarchical balancing weights require only that treatment is ignorable given covariates and cluster membership, while Mundlak methods additionally require an exponential family structure.

On this basis, by treating the binarization constraint of AIM (such as injection locking) as a Lagrange multiplier in optimization theory and combining it with a Lyapunov analysis from dynamical systems theory, an analytical framework for evaluating solution speed and accuracy is constructed, and further demonstrate that conventional AIMs possess a theoretical performance upper bound. Subsequently, by elevating the binarization constraint to a control variable, we propose the controllable analog Ising machine (CAIM), which integrates control Lyapunov functions and momentum-based optimization algorithms to realize adaptive sampling-feedback control, thereby surpassing the performance limits of conventional AIMs. In a proof-of-concept CAIM demonstration implemented using an FPGA-controlled LC-oscillator Ising machine, CAIM achieves a twofold speedup and a 7\\% improvement in accuracy over AIM on a 50-node all-to-all weighted MaxCut problem, validating both the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed theoretical framework."}

Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems."}

In particular, assuming that the robot's tracking controller is implemented as a neural network, we design a lightweight, parallel Trojan network that can be embedded within the controller. This malicious module remains dormant during normal operation but, upon detecting a highly specific trigger condition defined by the robot's pose and goal parameters, compromises the primary controller's wheel velocity commands, resulting in undesired and potentially unsafe robot behaviours. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed Trojan network, which is validated through simulation under two different attack scenarios.

One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS.

Validation using synthetic linear and nonlinear datasets demonstrates that relevant predictors produced higher IRA values than irrelevant ones. Moreover, repeated evaluations produced results closely aligned with those from the single-execution analysis, confirming the robustness of the method.

Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals."}

We incorporate logarithmic barrier functions into the stage cost to enforce box constraints (upper and lower bounds on variables), yielding a smooth interior-point formulation that integrates seamlessly with the standard iLQR backward-forward pass. The Hessian contributions from the log barriers are positive definite, preserving and enhancing the positive definiteness of the quadratic approximations in iLQR and providing an intrinsic regularization effect that improves numerical stability and convergence. Moreover, since the negative logarithm is convex, the addition of log barrier terms preserves convexity if the cost is already convex. We further analyze how the barrier-augmented iLQR naturally adapts feedback gains near constraint boundaries. In particular, at convergence, the feedback terms associated with saturated control channels go to zero, recovering a purely feedforward behavior whenever control is saturated. Numerical examples on constrained nonlinear control problems demonstrate that the proposed method reliably respects box constraints and maintains favorable convergence properties."}

To hedge the market-wide risks, such as the COVID-19 shock, trading strategies that exploit residual factors have been shown to be effective. However, financial time series often exhibit near-singular eigenstructures, which hinder the stable and accurate estimation of residual factors. This paper proposes a method for extracting residual factors from financial time series that hierarchically applies principal component analysis (PCA) and Gaussian graphical model (GGM). Our hierarchical approach balances stable estimation with elimination of factors that PCA alone cannot fully remove, enabling efficient extraction of residual factors. We use multivariate totally positive of order 2 (MTP2)-constrained GGM to capture the predominance of positive correlations in financial data. Our analysis proves that the resulting residual factors exhibit stronger orthogonality than those obtained with PCA alone. Across multiple experiments with varying test periods and training set lengths, the proposed method consistently achieved superior orthogonality of the residual factors.

A large number of NTN nodes, such as satellites, are required to establish a global NTN, but not all operators have the capability to deploy such a system. Therefore, cooperation among multiple operators, facilitated by an orchestrator, enables the construction of virtually large-scale constellations. In this paper, we propose a weak-control-based orchestration framework that coordinates multiple NTN operators while ensuring that operations align with the policies of both the orchestrator and the individual operators. Unlike centralized orchestration frameworks, where the orchestrator determines the entire route from source to destination, the proposed framework allows each operator to select preferred routes from multiple candidates provided by the orchestrator. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted numerical simulations under various scenarios and network configurations including dynamic NTN environments with time-varying topologies, showing that inter-operator cooperation improves the availability of feasible end-to-end routes. Furthermore, we analyzed the iterative negotiation process to address policy conflicts and quantitatively demonstrated the \"price of autonomy,\" where strict individual policies degrade global feasibility and performance. The results also demonstrate that outcomes of the proposed framework depend on the operators' policies and that hop count and latency increase as the number of operators grows.

Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the exponential growth of space complexity, which severely limits their scalability.

Upon entering the spin density wave state below 153 K, the $A_{1g}$ channel exhibits an abrupt electronic spectral gap with a clear isosbestic point. In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations. Collectively, these findings identify a ground state of the bilayer nickelate characterized by competing bond-diagonal interactions, spin disproportionation, and an incipient lattice instability, establishing key ingredients for understanding the mechanism of nickelate superconductivity."}

The movement of the particles is guided by the local shape of the landscape, and this shape is also affected by the presence of different particle species. When a particle species push the landscape in the same (opposite) direction of its own motion, it is called an aligned (a reverse) bias. Aligned bias promotes ordering while reverse bias destroys it. In absence of vacancies, the system reduces to previously studied LH model with different kinds of ordered and disordered phases which could be explained as a competition or cooperation between aligned bias and reverse bias. This interplay is expected to remain unaffected even when vacancies are present since vacancies do not impart any kind of bias on the landscape. However, we find presence of vacancies effectively weakens the reverse bias and this significantly changes the outcome of the competition between the two bias types. As a result novel ordered phases emerge which were not seen before. We analytically calculate the new phase boundaries within mean field approximation. We show even when aligned bias is weaker than reverse bias, it is possible to find long range order in the system. We discover two new phases where particle species showing weak aligned bias phase separate and the other species with strong reverse bias stays mixed with the vacancies. We call these phases finite current with partial phase separation (FPPS) and vacancy induced phase separation (VIPS). The landscape beneath the phase separated species takes the form of a macroscopic hill or valley in FPPS phase. But in VIPS phase it has the shape like a plateau whose height scales as square root of system size. The landscape in the remaining part of the system is disordered in both these phases."}

A posteriori error estimators are constructed to adjust the sample size, mesh size, and step length. The size of the sample set in the stochastic gradient approximation is dynamically determined depending on the variance of the shape derivative. When constructing the a posteriori error estimator in the physical domain, errors arising from the discretization of the deformation bilinear form, which provides a descent direction, are considered, in addition to errors from the discretization of the linear elasticity system. The step length in gradient-based optimization is also adaptively adjusted by estimating the Lipschitz constant of the stochastic shape derivative. Moreover, an analysis of the existence and distributed-form derivation of the stochastic shape derivative is provided. Finally, the proposed estimation-based adaptive stochastic optimization framework is validated on leg-like structural components, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing touchdown compliance under uncertain contact forces."}

Classical strength-of-connection measures typically rely only on matrix entries or geometric distances, which often fail to capture weak couplings across material interfaces or align with anisotropy directions, ultimately leading to poor convergence. The proposed approach directly incorporates material tensor information into the coarsening process, enabling a reliable detection of weak connections and ensuring that coarse levels preserve the true structure of the underlying problem. As a result, smooth error components are represented properly and sharp coefficient jumps or directional anisotropies are handled consistently. A wide range of academic tests and real-world applications, including thermally activated batteries and solar cells, demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robustness across material contrasts, anisotropies, and mesh variations. Scalability and parallel performance of the algebraic multigrid method highlight the suitability for large-scale, high-performance computing environments."}

A large number of NTN nodes, such as satellites, are required to establish a global NTN, but not all operators have the capability to deploy such a system. Therefore, cooperation among multiple operators, facilitated by an orchestrator, enables the construction of virtually large-scale constellations. In this paper, we propose a weak-control-based orchestration framework that coordinates multiple NTN operators while ensuring that operations align with the policies of both the orchestrator and the individual operators. Unlike centralized orchestration frameworks, where the orchestrator determines the entire route from source to destination, the proposed framework allows each operator to select preferred routes from multiple candidates provided by the orchestrator. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted numerical simulations under various scenarios and network configurations including dynamic NTN environments with time-varying topologies, showing that inter-operator cooperation improves the availability of feasible end-to-end routes. Furthermore, we analyzed the iterative negotiation process to address policy conflicts and quantitatively demonstrated the \"price of autonomy,\" where strict individual policies degrade global feasibility and performance. The results also demonstrate that outcomes of the proposed framework depend on the operators' policies and that hop count and latency increase as the number of operators grows. These findings validate the proposed framework's ability to deliver practical benefits of orchestrated multi-operator collaboration in future NTN environments."}

Cauchy--Schwarz (CS) constraints can restore security by coupling $n$-photon yields across intensities, but they introduce nonlinear square-root constraints that are commonly handled via outer linearisation around channel-model-based reference points. We propose a reproducible alternative: first solve the full CS-constrained parameter-estimation problems using the interior-point nonlinear solver IPOPT, then use the resulting candidate solution as the linearisation point for the outer optimisation that certifies a valid lower bound on the asymptotic key rate. Simulations for both coarse-grained model-independent correlations and fine-grained truncated-Gaussian models show consistently tighter key-rate bounds than canonical reference points, and in some cases allow certifying optimality when both optimisation stages coincide."}

Recently, Tensor Networks methods, which utilize high-dimensional linear algebra and achieve massive hardware parallelization, have emerged as a rapidly developing paradigm for efficiently solving these tasks. Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the exponential growth of space complexity, which severely limits their scalability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Branch-and-Bound Tensor Network (BBTN) method, which seamlessly integrates the adaptive search framework of branch-and-bound with the efficient contraction of tropical tensor networks, significantly extending the reach of exact algorithms. We show that BBTN significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art solvers, setting new benchmarks for exact computation. It pushes the boundaries of tractability to previously unreachable scales, enabling exact ground-state counting for $\\pm J$ spin glasses up to $64 \\times 64$ and solving Maximum Independent Set problems on King's subgraphs up to $100 \\times 100$. For hard instances, BBTN dramatically reduces the computational cost of standard Tropical Tensor Networks, compressing years of runtime into minutes.

We compare implementations using the analytic Frechet derivative of this map with a simple central-difference approximation. Because the method does not rely on time evolution, it is agnostic to dynamical stability and can detect both stable and unstable stationary states. Its accuracy is determined mainly by the numerical treatment of convolutions and quadrature, rather than by differentiation stencils. We apply the approach to three model problems with linear diffusion, use existing analytical results to verify the outputs, and reproduce known bifurcation diagrams, as well as new bifurcation behaviour not previously observed in this kind of problem."}

In life testing, immediate failures result in zero lifetimes, often due to defects or poor quality, especially in electronics and clinical trials. These failures, called inliers at zero, are difficult to model using standard approaches. The presence and proportion of inliers may influence the accuracy of extreme value analysis, bias parameter estimates, or even lead to severe events or extreme effects, such as drought or crop failure. In such scenarios, a key issue in extreme value analysis is determining a suitable threshold to capture tail behaviour accurately. Although some extreme value mixture models address threshold and tail estimation, they often inadequately handle inliers, resulting in suboptimal results. Bulk model misspecification can affect the threshold, extreme value estimates, and, in particular, the tail proportion. There is no unified framework for defining extreme value mixture models, especially the tail proportion. This paper proposes a flexible model that handles extremes, inliers, and the tail proportion. Parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. Compared the proposed model estimates with the classical mean excess plot, parameter stability plot, and Pickands plot estimates.

The transverse thermal conductivity $κ_{xy}$ exhibits a pronounced maximum in fields of a few Tesla. This characteristic field dependence allows us to identify the microscopic origin of the thermal Hall effect in this system.

Our goal is using (synthetic) data to tune the parameters of the governing equations and to assess the uncertainty on the predictions of the dynamics due to the residual uncertainty on the parameters remaining after the tuning procedure. To this end, we apply techniques from uncertainty quantification for parametric differential models. We first perform a global sensitivity analysis using both Sobol and Morris indices to assess how parameter uncertainty impacts model predictions, and fix the value of parameters with negligible impact.

We benchmark the method for bulk and layered SrVO$_3$ in equilibrium and apply it to a prototypical nonequilibrium geometry in which a voltage bias is applied perpendicular to the layer via reservoirs held at different chemical potentials. For bulk SrVO$_3$, MCA reproduces the metallic state at moderate interaction strengths, but it overestimates the weight of the lower band relative to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and fork tensor product state (FTPS) solvers. With respect to QMC and FTPS, MCA yields an earlier metal-to-insulator transition as the electron-electron interaction is increased. In layered SrVO$_3$ at equilibrium, MCA partially captures the orbital polarization in favor of the in-plane $xy$ orbital, although not as strong as in the DMFT-converged results obtained with QMC. However, when performing a one-shot impurity calculation initialized with the DFMT-QMC results, MCA yields orbital occupations which show a stronger charge polarization in favor of orbital $xy$. This suggests that our approach can be used to study multiorbital impurity problems when the focus is to assess properties without performing the full DMFT self-consistent loop. Finally, under applied bias, we observe a pronounced redistribution of orbital occupations, demonstrating that the method captures bias-driven orbital charge transfer in realistic materials in nonequilibrium conditions."}

First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information."}

This has led much of the SP literature to restrict the second stage to linear or simplified models. We develop a GPU-based framework that makes full-fidelity integer second-stage models tractable at scale. The key innovation is a set of hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU kernels that expose parallelism across scenarios, dynamic-programming (DP) layers, and route or action options, enabling Bellman updates to be executed in a single pass over more than 1,000,000 realizations. We evaluate the approach in two representative SP settings: a vectorized split operator for stochastic vehicle routing and a DP for inventory reinsertion. Implementation scales nearly linearly in the number of scenarios and achieves a one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, allowing far larger scenario sets and reliably stronger first-stage decisions. The computational leverage directly improves decision quality: much larger scenario sets and many more first-stage candidates can be evaluated within fixed time budgets, consistently yielding stronger SAA solutions. Our results show that full-fidelity integer second-stage models are tractable at scales previously considered impossible, providing a practical path to large-scale, realistic stochastic discrete optimization."}

Rasmussen's dynamic safety model motivates drift under competing pressures, but operationalizing it for software is difficult because many high-value operational signals (effort, remaining margin, incident impact) are compositional and their parts evolve. We propose a vision for drift observability on the simplex: model drift and boundary proximity in Aitchison geometry to obtain coordinate-invariant direction and distance-to-safety in interpretable balance coordinates. To remain comparable under churn, a monitor would continuously refresh its part inventory and policy-defined boundaries from engineering artifacts and apply lineage-aware aggregation.

This challenge is exacerbated in the distributed quantum computing regime, where quantum networks introduce additional communication-induced noise. While error mitigation techniques such as Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) have proven effective for standalone quantum processors, their behavior in distributed architectures is not yet well understood. We investigate ZNE in this setting by comparing Global optimization (ZNE is applied prior to circuit partitioning), against Local optimization (ZNE is applied independently to each sub-circuit). Partitioning is performed on a monolithic circuit, which is then transformed into a distributed implementation by inserting noisy teleportation-based communication primitives between sub-circuits. We evaluate both approaches across varying numbers of quantum processing units (QPUs) and under heterogeneous local and network noise conditions. Our results demonstrate that Global ZNE exhibits superior scalability, achieving error reductions of up to $48\\%$ across six QPUs. Moreover, we observe counterintuitive noise behavior, where increasing the number of QPUs improves mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication overhead. These findings highlight fundamental trade-offs in distributed quantum error mitigation and raise new questions regarding the interplay between circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network noise."}

While hybrid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they remain limited by the expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. We propose a unique encoding strategy that maps the viewing direction directly onto the Bloch sphere, leveraging the natural geometry of qubits to represent 3D directional data.

The essential low-energy electronic structure of Dirac quadrupole altermagnets can be understood from a gapless parent phase (i.e., the Dirac quadrupole semimetal), which has important implications for their response to external fields. Focusing on the strain-induced response, here we demonstrate that the topological piezomagnetic effect is a consequence of the way in which strain affects the Dirac points forming a quadrupole. We consider two microscopic models: a spinless two-band model describing a band inversion of $s$ and $d$ states, and a Lieb lattice model with collinear Néel order. The latter is a prototypical minimal model for altermagnetism in 2D and is realized in a number of recently proposed material compounds, which are discussed."}

In the last decades, security proofs robust against a wide range of eavesdropping strategies have established the theoretical soundness of several QKD protocols.

Subsequently, in the correction step, a correction term is determined by solving a subproblem governed by a perturbation expansion around the base approximation. This reformulation yields a convex optimization problem for the output coefficients, which guarantees rapic convergence. We rigorously derive an a posteriori error estitmate, demonstrating that the total generalization error is governed by the discrete residual norm, quadrature error, and a controllable truncation error. Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion problems with irregular moving interfaces, gradient-dependent diffusivities, and high-contrast media demonstrate that the proposed method effectively overcomes the optimization plateau.

Such data often occur as spatially correlated series of intensities and angles, thereby representing dependent bivariate response vectors of linear and circular components. To accommodate both the circular-linear dependence and spatial autocorrelation, while remaining flexible in marginal specifications, copula-based models for cylindrical data have been developed in the literature. However, existing approaches typically treat the copula parameters as constants unrelated to covariates, and regression specifications for marginal distributions are frequently restricted to linear predictors, thereby ignoring spatial correlation. In this work, we propose a structured additive conditional copula regression model for cylindrical data. The circular component is modeled using a wrapped Gaussian process, and the linear component follows a distributional regression model. Both components allow for the inclusion of linear covariate effects. Furthermore, by leveraging the empirical equivalence between Gaussian random fields (GRFs) and Gaussian Markov random fields, our approach avoids the computational burden typically associated with GRFs, while simultaneously allowing for non-stationarity in the covariance structure. Posterior estimation is performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.

They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics."}

We introduce a novel modeling framework for zero-inflated and error-prone functional data by incorporating a subject-specific time-varying validity indicator that explicitly distinguishes structural zeros from intrinsic values. We iteratively estimate the latent functional covariates and zero-inflation probabilities via maximum likelihood, using basis expansions and linear mixed models to adjust for measurement error. To assess the effects of the recovered latent covariates, we apply joint quantile regression across multiple quantile levels. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves estimation accuracy over methods that only address measurement error, and joint estimation yields substantial improvements compared with fitting separate quantile regressions. Applied to a childhood obesity study, our approach effectively corrects for zero inflation and measurement error in step counts, yielding results that closely align with energy expenditure and supporting their use as a proxy for physical activity."}

Our goal is using (synthetic) data to tune the parameters of the governing equations and to assess the uncertainty on the predictions of the dynamics due to the residual uncertainty on the parameters remaining after the tuning procedure. To this end, we apply techniques from uncertainty quantification for parametric differential models. We first perform a global sensitivity analysis using both Sobol and Morris indices to assess how parameter uncertainty impacts model predictions, and fix the value of parameters with negligible impact. Subsequently, we conduct an inverse uncertainty quantification analysis by Bayesian techniques to compute a data-informed probability distribution of the remaining model parameters. Finally, we carry out a forward uncertainty quantification analysis to compute the impact of the updated (residual) parametric uncertainties on the quantities of interest of the model. The whole procedure is sped up by using surrogate models, based on sparse-grids, to approximate the mapping of the uncertain parameters to the quantities of interest."}

This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$.

Existing methods, such as edge-wise testing, seed-based psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis, or correlation network comparison, typically suffer from low statistical power, arbitrary thresholding, and limited ability to capture distributed or nonlinear dependence patterns. We propose SpARCD (Spectral Analysis of Revealing Connectivity Differences), a novel statistical framework for detecting differences in brain connectivity between two experimental conditions. SpARCD leverages distance correlation, a dependence measure sensitive to both linear and nonlinear associations, to construct a weighted graph for each condition. It then constructs a differential operator via spectral filtering and uncovers connectivity changes by computing its leading eigenvectors. Inference is achieved via a permutation-based testing scheme that yields interpretable, region-level significance maps. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that SpARCD achieves superior power relative to conventional edge-wise or univariate approaches, particularly in the presence of complex dependency structures. Application to fMRI data from 113 early PTSD patients performing an emotional face-matching task reveals distinct networks associated with emotional reactivity and regulatory processes.

Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems."}

The analysis focuses on the primal-dual solution mapping of the regularized lower-level problem and exploits its properties to derive an almost-everywhere formula for the gradient of the regularized hyper-objective under mild assumptions. The paper then establishes conditions under which the hyper-objective of the actual problem is well defined and shows that its gradient can be approximated by the gradient of the regularized hyper-objective. Building on these results, a gradient sampling-based algorithm computes approximately stationary points of the regularized hyper-objective, and we prove its convergence to stationary points of the actual problem. Two numerical examples from machine learning demonstrate the proposed approach."}

This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states.

We focus on achieving fast transpilation times on circuits of interest, we find more than 100x faster compilation than Qiskit in some circuits with similar circuit quality, enabling transpilation of large, high-depth circuits in seconds. Unlike existing tools, QASMTrans offers end-to-end device-pulse compilation and direct quantum control integration with QICK, closing the gap between logical circuits and hardware control enabling closed-loop optimization. QASMTrans supports latency-aware Application-tailored Gate Sets (AGS) at the pulse level, identifying high-impact gate sequences on the circuit critical path and synthesizing optimized pulse schedules using pre-defined robust circuit ansatz. Validated through integrated QuTiP pulse-level simulation, this is found to significantly reduce execution latency and can improve final-state fidelity by up to 12% in some tested circuits. QASMTrans further implements device-aware, noise-adaptive transpilation that uses device calibration data for circuit placement on high-quality qubits and can focus on the circuit critical path to reduce transpilation-pass time while maintaining comparable fidelity. Additionally, it introduces circuit space sharing via calibration-aware device partitioning, enabling concurrent execution of multiple circuits or shots on a single QPU. Moreover, QASMTrans is entirely self-contained and has no external library dependencies, making it easy for practical deployment. By combining fast compilation, pulse-level control, and noise-aware optimization, QASMTrans enables real-time adaptive algorithms such as ADAPT-VQE and ADAPT-QAOA."}

However, population transfer with high performance across a broad frequency range is still challenging due to the finite Rabi coupling strength limited by laser powers. Here we propose a novel population-transfer scheme by suturing adiabatic control pulses with each pulse covering certain frequency interval, which are connected in a way that neighboring adiabatic pulses have opposite chirping directions. Taking the widely utilized hyperbolic-square-hyperbolic pulse as an example, we demonstrate that rapid and robust population transfer can be achieved. The transfer bandwidth scales linearly with the number of suture pulses while maintaining high fidelity, even at the suture points where adiabaticity breaks down. Crucially, these pulses can be realized by a single laser by means of temporal multiplexing. For a given bandwidth, this strategy substantially reduces the operational time which is necessary for on demand read-out and suppressing decoherence effects. Our scheme enables a dramatic increase in multimode storage capacity and paves the way for realizing practical quantum networks."}

To close this gap, we propose a secure algorithm model, mapping the dynamic algorithm to an equivalent physical optical model whose security can be rigorously assessed. Simulations illustrate the algorithm's non-unitary property and provide a quantitative analysis of the excess noise underestimation caused by the conventional algorithm. We further experimentally validate the necessity of the proposed modeling for dynamic digital signal processing, achieving a secret key rate of 14.4 Mbps based on estimated excess noise of 0.07 shot noise unit; whereas the conventional algorithm would have dangerously overestimated the key rate to 28.2 Mbps with noise of 0.008 shot noise unit.

In contrast to classical MDPs, which account for stochasticity by modeling the dynamics through a stochastic process with a known transition kernel, a robust MDP additionally accounts for ambiguity by optimizing against the most adverse transition kernel from an ambiguity set constructed via historical data. In this paper, we develop a unified solution framework for a broad class of robust MDPs with $s$-rectangular ambiguity sets, where the most adverse transition probabilities are considered independently for each state. Using our algorithms, we show that $s$-rectangular robust MDPs with $1$- and $2$-norm as well as $φ$-divergence ambiguity sets can be solved several orders of magnitude faster than with state-of-the-art commercial solvers, and often only a logarithmic factor slower than classical MDPs.

We establish three time scales that govern the dynamics, each with distinct characteristics. For times short compared to the Ehrenfest time, the evolution is classical, characterized by Gaussian dynamics. For sufficiently long times, as we increase the initial photon number, unitary Kerr evolution would generate macroscopic superpositions of coherent states (so-called kitten states), but this is severely restricted in the presence of small photon loss so that expectation values of observables coincide with their classical values. The intermediate time scale, however, shows resilient quantum behavior in the macroscopic limit. We show that in the mean-field non-Gaussian regime, the Kerr Hamiltonian (with small photon loss) generates a significant amount of Wigner-negativity, and classical flow is recovered only if the loss rate grows with system size. Our results broaden the usual understanding of quantum-to-classical transitions and demonstrate the potential for creating robust nonclassical resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing in the presence of loss."}

To this end, we first show that the matchgate-Clifford group (the intersection of the matchgate and Clifford groups) plus the $\\overline{T}$ gate (a $T$ unitary up to a phase) is universal for the matchgate group.

We prove that the resulting normalized cuts are tight and Pareto-optimal in the original state space. We further compare normalization with existing regularization-based approaches for handling dual degeneracy and explain why normalization offers key advantages.

We demonstrate this approach using the decision version of the $k$-independent set problem. Within a Hamming-shell framework, the DEM candidate volume is governed by the binary entropy of the bit-flip error rate, yielding an entropy-controlled classical postprocessing cost. Using experimental measurement data, DEM reduces postprocessing overhead relative to classical inference baselines. Numerical simulations and experimental results from neutral atom devices validate the predicted scaling with system size and error rate.

We show that maximally entangled probes are optimal for discriminating two qubit depolarizing channels, with any nonzero entanglement providing an advantage over single-system probes. In contrast, for dephasing channels in arbitrary dimensions, we prove that single-system probe can be optimal and that entanglement offers no improvement, even when the dephasing unitary is generalized. For qubit amplitude-damping channels, we identify distinct noise-dependent regimes in which either single-system probe outperforms maximally entangled probes and vice-versa.

In this thesis, I present my work using nuclear spins to explore these themes.\n  First, I study temporal quantum correlations quantified by the Leggett Garg inequality (LGI) for a qubit evolving under a superposition of unitary operators. Using a three qubit quantum register, we experimentally realized superposed unitaries and observed LGI violations exceeding the maximal quantum bound of 1.5, indicating enhanced non-classicality. Notably, this superposed unitary dynamics also showed improved robustness against decoherence.\n  Next, I investigate Lee Yang zeros, which are zeros of the partition function in the complex plane that reveal thermodynamic behavior near criticality. We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method to determine the full set of Lee Yang zeros of an asymmetric Ising model using a single quantum probe in a three-qubit nuclear spin register. We further showed that the mutual information between the probe and system peaks at times corresponding to these zeros.\n  I then report our study of the quantum Mpemba effect in nuclear spin relaxation, where systems farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to steady state, verified both theoretically and experimentally using NMR. Finally, I discuss our work on entanglement localization and delocalization induced by local interactions, leading to an apparent violation of the quantum data processing inequality. We showed that this violation is only apparent by constructing a completely positive and trace preserving map describing the dynamics."}

To this end, we consider different programs based on the restriction of the evolution to the set of separable (i.e., non-entangled) states, together with the discretization of the space of variables for numerical computations. As a first approach, we apply linear splitting methods to the restricted, continuous equations of motion derived from variational principles. We utilize an exchange interaction Hamiltonian to confirm that the numerical and analytical solutions coincide in the limit of small time steps. The application to different Hamiltonians shows the wide applicability of the method to detect dynamical entanglement. To avoid the derivation of analytical solutions for complex dynamics, we consider variational, numerical integration schemes, introducing a variational discretization for Lagrangians linear in velocities. Here, we examine and compare two approaches: one in which the system is discretized before the restriction is applied, and another in which the restriction precedes the discretization. We find that the \"first-discretize-then-restrict\" method becomes numerically unstable, already for the example of an exchange-interaction Hamiltonian, which can be an important consideration for the numerical analysis of constrained quantum dynamics. Thereby, broadly applicable numerical tools, including their limitations, for studying entanglement over time are established for assessing the entangling power of processes that are used in quantum information theory."}

Here we present an efficient and fully constructive method for implementing arbitrary HPTP maps. Unlike existing methods that decompose an HPTP map into multiple CPTP maps or approximate it using bipartite Hamiltonians with large Hilbert spaces, our approach compiles a target HPTP map into a single executable CPTP map whose Kraus rank is guaranteed to be no larger than the intrinsic rank of the target HPTP map plus one, followed by simple classical post-processing. Numerical results for inverse noise channels used in quantum error mitigation, including bosonic photon loss, confirm substantial reductions in resources and highlight scalability in higher-dimensional settings. Together with our numerical benchmarks, these results validate the efficiency and versatility of the proposed framework, opening a route to broader quantum-information applications enabled by HPTP processing."}

We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $α$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \\sqrt{\\frac{n^3}{2^{\\max\\{\\lfloor (α-1)/2 \\rfloor},0\\}}}\\cdot\\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $Ω( \\frac{n^2}{2^α} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $Ω( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction."}

Using a source of thermal radiation, we characterize the sensitivity of either material to infrared radiation and explore the impact of the infrared background through the targeted use of in-line filters in the wiring and ambient infrared absorbers. We identify both radiation channels as significant contributions to decoherence for tantalum but not for niobium qubits and achieve tunneling rates of 100 Hz and 300 Hz for niobium and tantalum respectively upon installation of infrared filters. Additionally, we find a time-dependence in the observed tunneling rates on the scale of days, which we interpret as evidence of slowly cooling, thermally radiating components in the experimental setup. Our findings indicate that continued improvements in coherence times may require renewed attention to radiative backgrounds and experimental setup design, especially when introducing new material platforms."}

While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics."}

In this work, we establish a strict hierarchy of physical realizability for the transposition, complex conjugation, and adjoint transformation of an unknown quantum channel. We present a probabilistic protocol that exactly implements the transpose with a single query. In contrast, we prove no-go theorems showing that neither the complex conjugate nor the adjoint can be implemented by any completely positive supermap, even probabilistically. We then overcome this impossibility by designing a virtual protocol for the complex conjugate based on quasi-probability decomposition, and show its optimality in terms of the diamond norm. As a key application, we propose a protocol to estimate the expectation values resulting from the Petz recovery map of an unknown channel, achieving an improved query complexity compared to existing methods."}

This connection improves key rates at small to intermediate blocklengths relative to existing fidelity-based bounds and enables the computation of entropy bounds for intermediate to large blocklengths.

Based on this channel, we present a measurement-controlled sampling algorithm that generates thermal states together with their Hamiltonian \"labels\" for general physical models. We prove that the total gate count of our algorithm scales cubically with system size, quadratically with inverse temperature, and as the inverse error tolerance to the two-thirds power, with logarithmic dependence on the allowed failure probability. We also show that the induced label distribution approaches a normal distribution reweighted by the thermal partition function, which makes an explicit trade-off between accuracy and effective range. Numerical simulations for a 2D Heisenberg model validate the predicted scaling and distribution. As an application, we compute unfolding-free level-spacing ratio statistics from sampled thermal states of a 2D transverse-field Ising model and observe a crossover toward the Wigner--Dyson prediction, demonstrating a practical and scalable route to chaos diagnostics and random matrix universality studies on near-term quantum hardware."}

Standard quantum error mitigation is typically based on post-processing strategies. In contrast, the present work explores a pre-processing approach, in which the effects of noise are mitigated before performing a measurement on the output state. The main idea is to find an observable $Y$ such that its expectation value on a noisy quantum state $\\mathcal{E(ρ)}$ matches the expectation value of a target observable $X$ on the noiseless quantum state $ρ$. Our method requires the execution of a noisy quantum circuit, followed by the measurement of the surrogate observable $Y$. The main enablers of our method in practical scenarios are Tensor Networks. The proposed method improves over Tensor Error Mitigation (TEM) in terms of average error, circuit depth, and complexity, attaining a measurement overhead that approaches the theoretical lower bound. The improvement in terms of classical computation complexity is in the order of $\\sim 10^6$ times when compared to the post-processing computational cost of TEM in practical scenarios. Such gain comes from eliminating the need to perform the set of informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements (IC-POVM) required by TEM, as well as any other tomographic strategy."}

However, the application of quantum algorithms to integer optimization problems remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we study the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to integer problems on graphs, with each integer variable encoded in a qudit. We derive a general iterative formula for depth-$p$ QAOA expectation on high-girth $d$-regular graphs of arbitrary size. The cost of evaluating the formula is exponential in the QAOA depth $p$ but does not depend on the graph size. Evaluating this formula for Max-$k$-Cut problem for $p\\leq 4$, we identify parameter regimes ($k=3$ with degree $d \\leq 10$ and $k=4$ with $d \\leq 40$) in which QAOA outperforms the Frieze-Jerrum semi-definite programming (SDP) algorithm, which provides the best worst-case guarantee on the approximation ratio. To strengthen the classical baseline we introduce a new heuristic algorithm, based on the degree-of-saturation, that empirically outperforms both the Frieze-Jerrum algorithm and shallow-depth QAOA. Nevertheless, we provide numerical evidence that QAOA may overtake this heuristic at depth $p\\leq 20$.

Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states."}

Two hybrid quantum-classical solvers are proposed: a structure-aware informed tree search (IQTS) and a modular bilevel framework (HBS), combining quantum subroutines with classical heuristics. Experimental results on IonQ's Aria-1 hardware demonstrate a methodology to map real-world logistics problems onto emerging combinatorial optimization-specialized hardware, yielding high-quality, Pareto-optimal solutions."}

It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems."}

Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations."}

Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems."}

An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods."}
