A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions.

Rev. Lett. 134, 201904 (2025)]. The two key ingredients that make such a calculation feasible with controlled uncertainties are: (i) the definition of lines of constant physics through the running of a non-perturbatively defined finite-volume coupling across a wide range of energy scales, and (ii) the use of shifted boundary conditions which allow a direct determination of the entropy density thus without the need for a zero-temperature subtraction. Considering the case of QCD with $N_f =3$ massless flavours in the temperature interval between 3 GeV and 165 GeV, we describe the numerical strategy based on integrating in the bare coupling and quark mass, the perturbative improvement of lattice observables, the optimization of numerical simulations, and the continuum extrapolation. Extensive consistency checks, including finite-volume and topological-freezing effects, confirm the robustness of the method. The final results have a relative accuracy of about $1\\%$ or better, and the errors are dominated by the statistical fluctuations of the Monte Carlo ensembles. We also compare our non-perturbative results with predictions from standard and hard thermal loop perturbation theory showing that at the level of $\\%$-precision contributions beyond those known, including non-perturbative ones due to ultrasoft modes, are relevant up to the highest temperatures explored. The methodological framework is general and readily applicable to QCD with four and five massive quark flavours and to other thermal observables, paving the way for systematic non-perturbative studies of thermal QCD at very high temperatures."}

This is significantly amplified in mobile scenarios, where the channel impulse response (CIR) becomes time-varying and stochastic. Obtaining accurate Channel State Information (CSI) for traditional model-based detection is intractable in such dynamic environments. While deep learning (DL) offers adaptability, its complexity is unsuitable for resource-constrained micro/nanodevices. This paper proposes a low-complexity Reservoir Computing (RC) based detector. The RC architecture utilizes a fixed, recurrent non-linear reservoir to project the time-varying received signal into a high-dimensional state space. This effectively transforms the complex temporal detection problem into a simple linear classification task, capturing ISI dynamics without explicit channel modeling or complex retraining. Evaluated in a realistic 3D mobile MC simulation environment (Smoldyn), our RC detector significantly outperforms classical detectors and achieves superior performance compared to complex ML methods (LSTM, CNN, MLP) under severe ISI. Importantly, RC achieves this with significantly fewer trainable parameters (e.g., 300 vs. up to 264k for MLP) and ultra-low latency inference (approx. 1 $μ$s per symbol)."}

Existing methods are primarily offline and unsuitable for real-time learning. To address this issue, we first develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm that updates parameter estimates recursively using incoming data. Considering that persistent excitation (PE) conditions are difficult to satisfy in feedback control scenarios, a second-order quasi-Newton algorithm is proposed to achieve faster convergence without requiring the PE condition. For both algorithms, corresponding versions are developed to handle known and unknown tampering strategies, and their parameter estimates are proven to converge almost surely over time. In particular, the second-order algorithm ensures convergence under a signal condition that matches the minimal excitation required by classical least-squares estimation in stochastic regression models. The second-order algorithm is also extended to an adaptive control framework, providing an explicit upper bound on the tracking error for binary-output FIR systems under unknown tampering. Three numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and show that the proposed methods are robust against data tampering.

Here, we uncover how the route unfolds through a sequential transition between two well-known but previously unconnected phenomena: chaotic itinerancy (CI) and intermittent synchronization (IS). Using a new symbolic dynamics, we show that CI emerges as a collective yet unsynchronized exploration of different domains of the high-dimensional attractor, whose dimension is reduced as the coupling increases, ultimately collapsing back into the reference chaotic attractor of an individual unit. At this stage, the IS can emerge as irregular alternations between synchronous and asynchronous phases. The two phenomena are therefore mutually exclusive, each dominating a distinct coupling interval and governed by different mechanisms. Network structural heterogeneity enhances itinerant behavior since access to different domains of the attractor depends on the nodes' topological roles. The CI--IS crossover occurs within a consistent coupling interval across models and topologies. Experiments on electronic oscillator networks confirm this two-step process, establishing a unified framework for the route to synchronization in complex systems."}

The latter computation is known to be done by pseudo-inverting the graph Laplacian matrix. At that, our approach is alternative to one based on Ollivier-Ricci geometric flow for community detection on graphs, significantly outperforming it in terms of computation time.

Nonlinearities are modeled using incremental quadratic constraints, including Lipschitz, L-smooth, and sector-bounded nonlinearities. Funnel invariance is ensured via a DLMI. Together with pointwise-in-time LMIs for state and input constraints, we formulate a continuous-time funnel synthesis problem. To solve it using numerical optimal control techniques, the DLMI is reformulated into a differential matrix equality (DME) and an LMI, where the DME acts as a funnel dynamics equation. We explore different formulations of these funnel dynamics. Continuous-time constraint satisfaction is addressed through two convex methods: one based on intermediate constraint-checking points, and another using a successive convexification method with subgradients to handle nondifferentiable maximum eigenvalue functions. Theoretical justification is provided for the existence of a measurable and integrable subgradient for the latter. The method is demonstrated on two numerical examples: the control of a unicycle and a 6-degree-of-freedom quadrotor for obstacle avoidance."}

However, as matrix size grows, interconnect resistance increasingly degrades computational accuracy and limits circuit scalability. Modeling and evaluating these effects are therefore critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. Traditional SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulators, which rely on modified nodal analysis, become prohibitively slow for large-scale AMC circuits due to the quadratic growth of nodes and feedback connections. In this work, we model AMC circuits with interconnect resistance for two key operations-matrix inversion (INV) and eigenvector computation (EGV), and propose fast solving algorithms tailored for each case. The algorithms exploit the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, enabling rapid and accurate solutions. Compared to SPICE, they achieve several orders of magnitude acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. We further extend the approach to open-loop matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) circuits, demonstrating similar efficiency gains. Finally, leveraging these fast solvers, we develop a bias-based compensation strategy that reduces interconnect-induced errors by over 50% for INV and 70% for EGV circuits. It also reveals the scaling behavior of the optimal bias with respect to matrix size and interconnect resistance."}

Compared with quantile regression, which has been extensively developed and applied across disciplines, ES regression remains in its early stage, partly because the traditional empirical risk minimization framework is not directly applicable. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric framework for expected shortfall regression based on a two-step approach that treats the conditional quantile function as a nuisance parameter. Leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, we construct a two-step ES estimator using feedforward ReLU networks, which can alleviate the curse of dimensionality when the underlying functions possess hierarchical composition structures. However, ES estimation is inherently sensitive to heavy-tailed response or error distributions. To address this challenge, we integrate a properly tuned Huber loss into the neural network training, yielding a robust deep ES estimator that is provably resistant to heavy-tailedness in a non-asymptotic sense and first-order insensitive to quantile estimation errors in the first stage. Comprehensive simulation studies and an empirical analysis of the effect of El Niño on extreme precipitation illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method."}

Here, we uncover how the route unfolds through a sequential transition between two well-known but previously unconnected phenomena: chaotic itinerancy (CI) and intermittent synchronization (IS). Using a new symbolic dynamics, we show that CI emerges as a collective yet unsynchronized exploration of different domains of the high-dimensional attractor, whose dimension is reduced as the coupling increases, ultimately collapsing back into the reference chaotic attractor of an individual unit. At this stage, the IS can emerge as irregular alternations between synchronous and asynchronous phases. The two phenomena are therefore mutually exclusive, each dominating a distinct coupling interval and governed by different mechanisms. Network structural heterogeneity enhances itinerant behavior since access to different domains of the attractor depends on the nodes' topological roles. The CI--IS crossover occurs within a consistent coupling interval across models and topologies. Experiments on electronic oscillator networks confirm this two-step process, establishing a unified framework for the route to synchronization in complex systems."}

In this work, we extensively tested FNOs on a variety of systems with non-linear and non-stationary properties, using a wide range of forcing functions to isolate failure mechanisms. FNOs stand out in modeling linear systems, regardless of complexity, while achieving near-perfect energy preservation and accurate spectral representation for linear dynamics. However, they fail on non-linear systems, where the failure manifests as artificial energy dissipation and manipulated frequency content. This limitation persists regardless of training dataset size, and we discuss the root cause through discretization error analysis. Comparison with LSTM as the baseline shows FNOs are superior for both linear and non-linear systems, independent of the training dataset size. We develop a spectrogram-based loss function that combines time-domain Mean Squared Error (MSE) with frequency-domain magnitude and phase errors, addressing the low-frequency bias of FNOs. This frequency-aware training eliminates artificial dissipation in linear systems and enhances the energy ratios of non-linear systems. The IEA 15MW turbine model validates our findings. Despite hundreds of degrees of freedom, FNO predictions remain accurate because the turbine behaves in a predominantly linear regime. Our findings establish that system non-linearity, rather than dimensionality or complexity, determines the success of FNO.

This paper suggests an augmented implementation of AC power flow that uses an additional two bus types (PQV and P) to help resolve voltage bound violations present in the traditional approach. The proposed method sacrifices the voltage setpoint at a generator in exchange for fixing the voltage at a load bus, thereby moving a degree of freedom around the network.

Moreover, the way in which agents interact and influence one another is often unknown and must be inferred from partial observations of the system.

For a parameter $1 \\le p \\le r$, $A_p := \\sum_{i=1}^p σ_i u_i v_i^\\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase \"low-rank approximation\". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable.

We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank. This assumption is frequently met in practice, and we think that this case deserves a separate, accessible treatment."}

Our approach integrates Time-Integrated Deep Operator Networks (TI-DeepONets) as differentiable PDE surrogate models within the Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC)-a self-supervised learning framework for constrained neural control policies. The TI-DeepONet architecture learns temporal derivatives and couples them with numerical integrators, thus preserving the temporal causality of infinite-dimensional PDEs while reducing error accumulation in long-horizon predictions. Within DPC, we leverage automatic differentiation to compute policy gradients by backpropagating the expectations of optimal control loss through the learned TI-DeepONet, enabling efficient offline optimization of neural policies without the need for online optimization or supervisory controllers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method learns feasible parametric policies across diverse PDE systems, including the heat, the nonlinear Burgers', and the reaction-diffusion equations. The learned policies achieve target tracking, constraint satisfaction, and curvature minimization objectives, while generalizing across distributions of initial conditions and problem parameters. These results highlight the promise of combining operator learning with DPC for scalable, model-based self-supervised learning in PDE-constrained optimal control."}

Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\\nabla T_y / \\nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios."}

On the one hand, agents are stubborn, i.e., have a tendency for one of the two opinions; on the other hand, there is a disruptive bias, $p\\in[0,1]$, that drives the agents toward the other opinion. The disruptive bias models external factors, such as market innovations or social controllers, aiming to challenge the status quo, while agents' stubbornness reinforces the initial opinion making it harder for the external bias to drive the process toward change. Each agent updates its opinion according to a nonlinear function of the states of its neighbors and of the bias $p$. We consider the case of random directed graphs with prescribed in- and out-degree sequences and we prove that the dynamics exhibits a phase transition: when the disruptive bias $p$ is larger than a critical threshold $p_c$, the population converges in constant time to a consensus on the disruptive opinion. Conversely, when the bias $p$ is less than $p_c$, the system enters a metastable state in which only a fraction of agents $q_\\star(p)<1$ will share the new opinion for a long time. We characterize $p_c$ and $q_\\star(p)$ explicitly, showing that they only depend on few simple statistics of the degree sequences. Our analysis relies on a dual system of branching, coalescing, and dying particles, which we show exhibits equivalent behavior and allows a rigorous characterization of the system's dynamics. Our results characterize the interplay between the degree of the agents, their stubbornness, and the external bias, shedding light on the tipping points of opinion dynamics in networks."}

These problems can be reformulated as McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) in a random environment, where the coefficients depend on the conditional law of the state given the common noise. Existing numerical methods, however, are largely limited to cases where interactions depend only on expectations or low-order moments, and therefore cannot address the general setting of full distributional dependence.\n  In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based algorithm for solving MV-FBSDEs with common noise and general mean-field interactions. Building on fictitious play, our method iteratively solves conditional FBSDEs with fixed distributions, where the conditional law is efficiently represented using signatures, and then updates the distribution through supervised learning. Deep neural networks are employed both to solve the conditional FBSDEs and to approximate the distribution-dependent coefficients, enabling scalability to high-dimensional problems. Under suitable assumptions, we establish convergence in terms of the fictitious play iterations, with error controlled by the supervised learning step. Numerical experiments, including a distribution-dependent mean-field game with common noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

To overcome these drawbacks, we propose Random Feature Bayesian Lasso Takens (rfBLT) for forecasting time series data. This non-parametric model captures the underlying system via the Takens' theorem and measures the degree of uncertainty with credible intervals. This is achieved by projecting delay embeddings into a higher-dimensional space via random features and applying regularization within the Bayesian framework to identify relevant terms.

The municipality iteratively updates taxes, subsidies, and operational constraints using a projected two-point (gradient-free) scheme, while lower levels respond through equilibrium computations (Frank-Wolfe for traveler equilibrium; operator best responses).

In this paper, we develop a nonparametric framework for expected shortfall regression based on a two-step approach that treats the conditional quantile function as a nuisance parameter. Leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, we construct a two-step ES estimator using feedforward ReLU networks, which can alleviate the curse of dimensionality when the underlying functions possess hierarchical composition structures. However, ES estimation is inherently sensitive to heavy-tailed response or error distributions. To address this challenge, we integrate a properly tuned Huber loss into the neural network training, yielding a robust deep ES estimator that is provably resistant to heavy-tailedness in a non-asymptotic sense and first-order insensitive to quantile estimation errors in the first stage. Comprehensive simulation studies and an empirical analysis of the effect of El Niño on extreme precipitation illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method."}

Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/MLF."}

Existing methods are primarily offline and unsuitable for real-time learning. To address this issue, we first develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm that updates parameter estimates recursively using incoming data. Considering that persistent excitation (PE) conditions are difficult to satisfy in feedback control scenarios, a second-order quasi-Newton algorithm is proposed to achieve faster convergence without requiring the PE condition. For both algorithms, corresponding versions are developed to handle known and unknown tampering strategies, and their parameter estimates are proven to converge almost surely over time. In particular, the second-order algorithm ensures convergence under a signal condition that matches the minimal excitation required by classical least-squares estimation in stochastic regression models. The second-order algorithm is also extended to an adaptive control framework, providing an explicit upper bound on the tracking error for binary-output FIR systems under unknown tampering. Three numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and show that the proposed methods are robust against data tampering. Finally, the approach is validated via a vehicle emission control problem, where it effectively improves the detection accuracy of excess-emission events."}

In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion.

Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $η\\simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order.

This paper suggests an augmented implementation of AC power flow that uses an additional two bus types (PQV and P) to help resolve voltage bound violations present in the traditional approach.

[Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed."}

They are widely used in traditional biomedical studies and are increasingly adopted in modern digital platforms. However, standard analyses of crossover designs often rely on strong parametric models, making inference vulnerable to model misspecification. This paper adopts a design-based framework to analyze general crossover designs. We make two main contributions. First, we use potential outcomes to formally define the causal estimands and assumptions on the data-generating process. For any given type of crossover design and assumptions on potential outcomes, we outline a procedure for identification and estimation, emphasizing the central role of the treatment assignment mechanism in design-based inference. Second, we unify the analysis of crossover designs using least squares, with restrictions on the coefficients and weights on the units. Based on the theory, we recommend the specification of the regression function, weighting scheme, and coefficient restrictions to assess identifiability, construct efficient estimators, and estimate variances in a unified fashion. Crucially, the least squares procedure is simple to implement, and yields not only consistent and efficient point estimates but also valid variance estimates even when the working regression model is misspecified."}

Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem."}

For the first 290 years, the Doomsday critical scaling provides a superior description for population changes, with a singularity at 2026. This is followed by the crossover to an exceptional 'reversed criticality' patterm, which has held over the last six decades, to the present day. The analysis suggests that the evolution of the human Real Intelligence (RI) population during the Innovations-driven Industrial Revolution times - a period of rapidly increasing connectivity and complexity - can serve as a model counterpart for the puzzling dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) growth.

The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is driving unprecedented growth in data center capacity, with global electricity demand from data centers projected to double by 2026. This growth creates substantial challenges for power transmission networks, as large concentrated loads can cause congestion and threaten grid reliability. Meanwhile, the intermittent nature of solar and wind generation requires flexible resources to maintain grid reliability and minimize curtailment. This paper assesses whether data center spatial flexibility-the ability to migrate computational workloads geographically-can serve as a grid resource to address these challenges. An optimal power flow model is developed to co-optimize generation dispatch, security reserves, and flexible data center loads. Case studies on a modified IEEE 73-bus system show that inflexible data center placement can lead to severe transmission violations, with line overloads reaching 30.1%. Enabling spatial flexibility mitigates these violations in the studied scenarios and restores system feasibility. This flexibility also reduces solar curtailment by up to 61.0% by strategically reallocating load to solar-rich areas. The results suggest that spatial flexibility offers a viable approach to defer transmission upgrades and enhance renewable utilization."}

At the upper layer, optimal PSES siting and network topology decisions are made to minimize total investment and operational costs.

This approach inherits the local conservation property of finite volume methods while benefiting from the approximation capabilities of discontinuous Galerkin spaces with significantly fewer degrees of freedom. We establish a rigorous error analysis of the proposed scheme: in particular, we prove optimal-order convergence in the DG energy norm and suboptimal-order convergence in \\(L^2\\) norm. The theoretical analysis is supported by a set of one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments with Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions, which confirm both the accuracy and efficiency of the method.

In this paper, we propose an extension of the possibility-theoretic inferential model (IM) framework that offers reliable, data-driven uncertainty quantification about the unknown model structure. This particular extension allows for the inclusion of incomplete prior information about the unknown structure that facilitates regularization. We prove that this new, regularized, possibilistic IM's uncertainty quantification is suitably calibrated relative to the set of joint distributions compatible with the data-generating process and assumed partial prior knowledge about the structure. This implies, among other things, that the derived confidence sets for the unknown model structure attain the nominal coverage probability in finite samples.

The municipality iteratively updates taxes, subsidies, and operational constraints using a projected two-point (gradient-free) scheme, while lower levels respond through equilibrium computations (Frank-Wolfe for traveler equilibrium; operator best responses). This model-free pipeline enforces constraints, accommodates heterogeneous users and modes, and scales to higher-dimensional policy vectors without differentiating through equilibrium maps.\n  On a real multimodal network for Zurich, Switzerland, our method attains substantially better municipal objectives than Bayesian optimization and Genetic algorithms, and identifies integration incentives that increase multimodal usage while improving both operator objectives.

For nonlinear systems, carefully selected sensor motion can be exploited to extract information that is otherwise unavailable, i.e. active sensing. Empirical, yet mathematically rigorous, tools are needed to (1) quantify how sensor movement can contribute to estimation performance, and (2) leverage this knowledge to improve state estimates. Here, we introduce \"BOUNDS: Bounding Observability for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems\", and Python package pybounds, which can discover patterns of sensor motion that increase information for individual state variables. Crucially, it is suitable for partially observable nonlinear systems, accounts for sensor noise, and can be applied to either simulated or observed trajectories. We demonstrate BOUNDS through a case study on a flying agent with limited sensors, showing how active sensing can be leveraged to estimate key variables such as ground speed, altitude, and ambient wind direction. Finally, we present a framework to refine sporadic estimates from bouts of active sensing that combines data-driven state and observability estimation from artificial neural networks with model-based estimation, which we call the Augmented Information Kalman Filter (AI-KF). We validate our framework using altitude estimation given GPS-denied data from an outdoor quadcopter flight.

Since this equation involves an integrated history of past velocities, considerable efforts have been made to approximate this dynamics by data-driven Markov models, where auxiliary variables are used to compensate for the memory term. In recent works we have developed two algorithms which can be used for this purpose, provided the dynamics in question are scalar processes. Here we extend these algorithms to vector-valued processes. As a physical test bed we consider an S-shaped particle sliding on a planar substrate, which gives rise to a truly two-dimensional velocity process. The two algorithms provide Markov approximations of this process with 10-20 auxiliary variables and a very accurate fit of the given autocorrelation data over the entire time interval where these data are non-negligible."}

We propose a residual-based error estimator that accounts for both the standard discretization error as well as the effect of the truncation boundary. This estimator is shown to be reliable and efficient under appropriate assumptions on the triangulation. Based on this estimator, we devise an adaptive algorithm that automatically refines the mesh and pushes the truncation boundary towards infinity. We prove that this algorithm converges and even achieves optimal rates in terms of the number of degrees of freedom. We finally provide numerical examples illustrating our key theoretical findings."}

Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $η\\simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order.

In particular, we focus on the dynamics of magnetic monopole excitations, which, in sharp contrast to their equilibrium counterparts, exhibit a non-ergodic stochastic random-walk process with long-tailed, power-law distributed waiting times, where the power-law exponent is tunable by the system's effective temperature. Heating is accelerated at intermediate driving frequencies, and the system eventually heats up to an infinite-temperature state.

To address this problem, this paper proposed a rapid prediction method of modal frequency and actual anchor radius of designed MHR using an improved Transformer-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for rapid design sizing. High-temperature-induced softening deformation at the anchor point reduces the actual anchor radius below the designed value. By varying key parameters such as resonator height, anchor radius and edge thickness, finite element glassblowing simulation and modal analyse were conducted to obtain the first six modal frequencies and actual anchor radius. To address regression prediction challenges with limited data, dual multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms replaced the transformer's standard Feed Forward Network, to improve hidden information capture for high-accuracy predictions of modal frequencies and anchor radius. By checking fabricating feasibility of anchor radius and allowing rapid modal characteristics evaluation without interference, ablation and comparative experiments validated the method's superiority, as an effective support of MHR design.

The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is driving unprecedented growth in data center capacity, with global electricity demand from data centers projected to double by 2026. This growth creates substantial challenges for power transmission networks, as large concentrated loads can cause congestion and threaten grid reliability. Meanwhile, the intermittent nature of solar and wind generation requires flexible resources to maintain grid reliability and minimize curtailment. This paper assesses whether data center spatial flexibility-the ability to migrate computational workloads geographically-can serve as a grid resource to address these challenges. An optimal power flow model is developed to co-optimize generation dispatch, security reserves, and flexible data center loads. Case studies on a modified IEEE 73-bus system show that inflexible data center placement can lead to severe transmission violations, with line overloads reaching 30.1%. Enabling spatial flexibility mitigates these violations in the studied scenarios and restores system feasibility. This flexibility also reduces solar curtailment by up to 61.0% by strategically reallocating load to solar-rich areas. The results suggest that spatial flexibility offers a viable approach to defer transmission upgrades and enhance renewable utilization."}

Existing methods are primarily offline and unsuitable for real-time learning. To address this issue, we first develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm that updates parameter estimates recursively using incoming data. Considering that persistent excitation (PE) conditions are difficult to satisfy in feedback control scenarios, a second-order quasi-Newton algorithm is proposed to achieve faster convergence without requiring the PE condition. For both algorithms, corresponding versions are developed to handle known and unknown tampering strategies, and their parameter estimates are proven to converge almost surely over time. In particular, the second-order algorithm ensures convergence under a signal condition that matches the minimal excitation required by classical least-squares estimation in stochastic regression models. The second-order algorithm is also extended to an adaptive control framework, providing an explicit upper bound on the tracking error for binary-output FIR systems under unknown tampering. Three numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and show that the proposed methods are robust against data tampering. Finally, the approach is validated via a vehicle emission control problem, where it effectively improves the detection accuracy of excess-emission events."}

If the joint distribution of the test statistics is known, the FWER level can be exhausted by determining critical values or adjusted $α$-levels. The adjustment is typically done under the common ANOVA assumptions. However, the performed tests are then only valid under the rather strong assumption of homogeneous null effects, i.e., when the null hypothesis applies to all subpopulations and their intersections. We show that under cancelling null effects, when heterogeneous effects cancel out in some or all subpopulations, this procedure does not provide FWER control.

For nonlinear systems, carefully selected sensor motion can be exploited to extract information that is otherwise unavailable, i.e. active sensing. Empirical, yet mathematically rigorous, tools are needed to (1) quantify how sensor movement can contribute to estimation performance, and (2) leverage this knowledge to improve state estimates. Here, we introduce \"BOUNDS: Bounding Observability for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems\", and Python package pybounds, which can discover patterns of sensor motion that increase information for individual state variables. Crucially, it is suitable for partially observable nonlinear systems, accounts for sensor noise, and can be applied to either simulated or observed trajectories. We demonstrate BOUNDS through a case study on a flying agent with limited sensors, showing how active sensing can be leveraged to estimate key variables such as ground speed, altitude, and ambient wind direction. Finally, we present a framework to refine sporadic estimates from bouts of active sensing that combines data-driven state and observability estimation from artificial neural networks with model-based estimation, which we call the Augmented Information Kalman Filter (AI-KF). We validate our framework using altitude estimation given GPS-denied data from an outdoor quadcopter flight.

In particular, we focus on the dynamics of magnetic monopole excitations, which, in sharp contrast to their equilibrium counterparts, exhibit a non-ergodic stochastic random-walk process with long-tailed, power-law distributed waiting times, where the power-law exponent is tunable by the system's effective temperature. Heating is accelerated at intermediate driving frequencies, and the system eventually heats up to an infinite-temperature state. However, the heating time is extremely sensitive to different initial-state realizations and also follows a long-tailed power-law distribution. We show that a drive-induced short-range attractive interaction between monopoles is responsible for the long-tailed distributions observed in both monopole and heating dynamics."}

For a parameter $1 \\le p \\le r$, $A_p := \\sum_{i=1}^p σ_i u_i v_i^\\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase \"low-rank approximation\". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$.

We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank. This assumption is frequently met in practice, and we think that this case deserves a separate, accessible treatment."}

While first-order total variation (TV) regularization effectively preserves edges, it often introduces staircase artifacts, whereas higher-order TV removes such artifacts but oversmooths fine details. To reconcile these competing effects, we propose a semi-convergent stage-wise framework that sequentially integrates first- and higher-order TV regularizers within an iterative restoration process implemented via ADMM. Each stage exhibits semi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iterates initially approach the ground truth before being degraded by over-regularization. By monitoring this evolution, the algorithm adaptively selects the locally optimal iterate (e.g., with the highest PSNR) and propagates it as the initial point for the next stage. This select-and-propagate mechanism effectively transfers local semi-convergence into a globally convergent iterative process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the sequence of stage-wise iterates is bounded, the objective values decrease monotonically. Extensive numerical experiments on denoising and deblurring benchmarks confirm that the proposed method achieves superior quantitative and perceptual performance compared with conventional first-, higher-order, hybrid TV methods, and learning based methods, while maintaining theoretical interpretability and algorithmic simplicity."}

Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy."}

High-temperature-induced softening deformation at the anchor point reduces the actual anchor radius below the designed value. By varying key parameters such as resonator height, anchor radius and edge thickness, finite element glassblowing simulation and modal analyse were conducted to obtain the first six modal frequencies and actual anchor radius.

This research aims to improve warehouse picking cycle time through simulation-based analysis, using a leading plumbing equipment distributor in Thailand as a case study. The study identifies inefficiencies such as disorganized storage and poor placement of high-frequency items that slow down picking. To address this, an optimized storage approach using ABC analysis is proposed, prioritizing high-demand items near the entrance. Three storage policies-Fixed, Random, and Combination (Fixed Zone)-are tested with a Zone Picking strategy through simulation to identify the most efficient picking routes. The findings provide insights for improving warehouse layout and inventory placement to enhance overall performance."}

When a sensor node depletes its energy reserves, manual intervention is often required to resume node operation. While lowering the duty cycle would help extend the network lifetime, this is often undesirable, especially in time-critical applications, where rapid collection and dissemination of information is vital. In this paper, we propose a context-aware energy management policy that helps balance the two opposing objectives of timely data collection and dissemination with energy conservation. We capture these objectives through the Value of Information (VoI) of observations made by a sensor node and the State of Energy (SoE) of the energy buffer. We formulate the energy management policy as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem which computes device sampling and transmission frequencies to maximize a defined utility criterion over a finite, receding, time-horizon. In the process, we also develop a unique mathematical representation for VoI, that adequately captures aspects related to continuity in monitoring, urgency of dissemination, and representation of the phenomena being observed. In the end, we use data collected from a real-world flash flood event, to evaluate our decision framework across multiple scenarios of energy availability."}

Our multi-scale derivation yields the exact mesoscopic fluctuating (Dean-Kawasaki) dynamics and the macroscopic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck system of equations. The analytical solution of this system reveals how a heterogeneous resource landscape alone is sufficient to generate the coupled structures of spatial and economic inequality, thus providing a formal link between micro-level stochasticity and macro-level deterministic order."}

Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy."}

Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem."}
