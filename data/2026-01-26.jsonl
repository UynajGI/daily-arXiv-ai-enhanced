Without the overhead of gauge constraints, simulating this model on an L*L torus requires only L*L qubits with two-body couplings, halving the conventional four-body coupled 2L*L qubits, enabling full experimental realization of Z2 lattice gauge theory on near-term devices."}

In collaboration with the WHO and Wits University, we study how to improve the efficiency of HIV testing with the goal of eventual deployment, directly supporting progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.3. While prior work has demonstrated the promise of intelligent algorithms for sequential, network-based HIV testing, existing approaches rely on assumptions that are impractical in our real-world implementations. Here, we study sequential testing on incrementally revealed disease networks and introduce Policy-Embedded Graph Expansion (PEGE), a novel framework that directly embeds a generative distribution over graph expansions into the decision-making policy rather than attempting explicit topological reconstruction. We further propose Dynamics-Driven Branching (DDB), a diffusion-based graph expansion model that supports decision making in PEGE and is designed for data-limited settings where forest structures arise naturally, as in our real-world referral process. Experiments on real HIV transmission networks show that the combined approach (PEGE + DDB) consistently outperforms existing baselines (e.g., 13% improvement in discounted reward and 9% more HIV detections with 25% of the population tested) and explore key tradeoffs that drive decision quality."}

It is argued that Albert Einstein initially sought a dynamical formulation in which ds encoded the gravitational effects, without invoking curvature as a physical entity. The now more familiar geometrical interpretation (identifying gravitation with spacetime curvature) gradually emerged through his collaboration with Marcel Grossmann and the adoption of the Ricci tensor in 1915. Anyhow, in his 1920 Leiden lecture, Einstein explicitly reinterpreted spacetime geometry as the state of a physical medium (an ether endowed with metrical properties but devoid of mechanical substance) thereby actually rejecting geometry as an independent ontological reality.\n  Building upon this mature view, gravitation is reconstructed from the Weak Equivalence Principle, understood as the exact compensation between inertial and gravitational forces acting on a body under a uniform gravitational field. From this fundamental principle, together with an extension of Fermat Principle to massive objects, the invariant ds is obtained, first in the static case, where the gravitational potential modifies the flow of proper time. Then, by applying the Lorentz transformation to this static invariant, its general form is derived for the case of matter in motion. The resulting invariant reproduces the relativistic form of Newton second law in proper time and coincides with the weak field limit of General Relativity in the harmonic gauge."}

Classical computational methods have enabled important breakthroughs in energy materials development, but they face scaling and time-complexity limitations, particularly for high-dimensional or strongly correlated material systems. Quantum computing (QC) promises to offer a paradigm shift by exploiting quantum bits with their superposition and entanglement to address challenging problems intractable for classical approaches. This perspective discusses the opportunities in leveraging QC to advance energy materials research and the challenges QC faces in solving complex and high-dimensional problems. We present cases on how QC, when combined with classical computing methods, can be used for the design and simulation of practical energy materials. We also outline the outlook for error-corrected, fault-tolerant QC capable of achieving predictive accuracy and quantum advantage for complex material systems."}

One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \\textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \\textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\\textit{\\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\\textit{\\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\\,K, which is associated with an \\textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers."}

Its atmospheric lifetime critically determines its concentration and climate impact, yet the processes controlling its removal remain poorly constrained in the Arctic. From 18 months of single-particle measurements at the Zeppelin Observatory (Svalbard), we analysed 37 liquid cloud events (~200 hours) to investigate the link between BC properties and in-cloud scavenging, providing the most extensive in-cloud single particle BC dataset to date. While large BC cores (DrBC>200 nm) were consistently scavenged, smaller cores were only partly removed. However, even thin soluble coatings significantly enhanced their scavenging, showing that mixing state modulates BC scavenging in the CCN-limited regime typical of Arctic low-level clouds. Seasonal variability in clear sky BC mixing state further suggests corresponding changes in scavenging efficiency. Our results demonstrate that besides size, the size-resolved BC mixing state is a key variable for BC scavenging in the Arctic and models should take it into consideration to accurately predict BC-cloud interaction."}

Yet, the available methods are either restricted to low-dimensional systems or suffer from conservative approximations. To address these limitations, we propose control architectures that combine the flexibility of Markov Decision Processes with the scalability of Model Predictive Controllers. The Model Predictive Controller tracks reference signals while remaining agnostic to the stochasticity and reach-avoid objective. Instead, the reach-avoid probability is maximized by optimally updating the controller's reference online. To achieve this, the closed-loop system, consisting of the system and Model Predictive Controller, is abstracted as a Markov Decision Process in which a new reference can be chosen at every time-step. A feedback policy generating optimal references is then computed via Dynamic Programming. If the state space of the system is continuous, the Dynamic Programming algorithm must be executed on a finite system approximation. Modifications to the Model Predictive Controller enable a computationally efficient robustification of the Dynamic Programming algorithm to approximation errors, preserving bounds on the achieved reach-avoid probability. The approach is validated on a perturbed 12D quadcopter model in cluttered reach-avoid environments proving its flexibility and scalability."}

While the Kondo effect has traditionally been understood to suppress magnetism through the formation of local singlets, recent studies suggest that Kondo interactions may enhance magnetic order under certain conditions. However, these scenarios often rely on complex electronic structures, including orbital and charge degrees of freedom, making the essential mechanisms difficult to isolate. Here we report the realization of a spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model in a Ni-based complex-a minimal spin-only analog of the Kondo lattice that isolates quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom. Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition. Perturbative analysis reveals that the Kondo coupling mediates effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin-1 sites, stabilizing the Néel order across the entire chain. Our results establish a universal boundary in Kondo physics, where coupling to spin-1/2 moments yields singlets, but to spin-1 and higher stabilizes magnetic order."}

While algorithmic homogeneity is well-documented, the distinct evolutionary pathways driven by content-based versus link-based recommendations remain unclear. Using an extended dynamic Bounded Confidence Model (BCM), we show that content-based algorithms--unlike their link-based counterparts--steer social networks toward a segregation-before-polarization (SbP) pathway. Along this trajectory, structural segregation precedes opinion divergence, accelerating individual isolation while delaying but ultimately intensifying collective polarization.

We consider the specific design where each therapist delivers each intervention (crossed therapist-intervention design), and the resulting therapist-intervention combinations are randomised to patients. We adopt a classical Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to propose a family of orthogonal factorial designs and their associated data analyses, which allow for therapist learning and centre too. We set out the associated data analyses using ANOVA and regression and report the results of a small simulation study conducted to explore the performance of the proposed randomisation methods in estimating the intervention effect and its standard error, the between-therapist variance and the between-therapist variance in the intervention effect. We conclude that more purposeful trial design has the potential to lead to better evidence on a range of complex interventions and outline areas for further methodological research."}

While these have been widely studied, the influence of electron-nuclear dynamics in driven cavities remains largely unknown. Here, we report a previously unrecognized mechanism of vibrational activation that emerges under collective ESC in driven optical cavities. Using semiclassical simulations that self-consistently combine Maxwell's equations with quantum molecular dynamics, we show that collective electronic Rabi oscillations coherently drive nuclear motion. This effect is captured using both vibrational wave-packet dynamics in a minimal two-level model and atomistic simulations based on time-dependent density-functional tight-binding with Ehrenfest dynamics. Vibrational activation depends non-monotonically on the Rabi frequency and is maximized when the collective polaritonic splitting resonates with a molecular vibrational mode. The mechanism exhibits features consistent with a stimulated Raman-like relaxation mechanism. Our results establish a self-consistent framework for realistic cavity-electron-nuclear dynamics."}

We establish conditions under which the associated species sampling process is proper and the distribution of a Markov stick-breaking process has full topological support, two fundamental desiderata for Bayesian nonparametric models.

However, each DMFT step is computationally demanding, and many iterations can be required to achieve convergence. Here, we accelerate the convergence of DMFT by initializing its self-consistent cycle with solutions from computationally cheaper and more approximate methods. We compare the initialization with the non-interacting solution to a range of quantum embedding compatible approaches: Hartree-Fock, the Hubbard-I approximation, rotationally invariant slave bosons (RISB), and its ghost extension (g-RISB). We find that these initializations can reduce the number of DMFT iterations by up to an order of magnitude, with g-RISB providing the most effective and reliable benefits. In most regimes, initializing with g-RISB and performing a single DMFT iteration suffices to recover the full dynamical structure. The improvement in convergence is controlled by the initial solution's accuracy in the low-energy part of the self-energy, on the scale of the non-interacting bandwidth. This strategy is especially effective at the Mott insulator-metal transition, where an initialization from the non-interacting limit can lead to a breakdown of DMFT due to the sign problem. Our results establish the usage of accurate yet cheaper quantum embedding methods as a powerful means to substantially reduce the computational cost of DMFT, particularly in regimes where convergence is slow or prone to failure."}

In this work, we study logical T-gate magic-state preparation in GKP-encoded photonic qubits using a repeat-until-success injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. We develop an architecture-level modeling framework based on a lightweight density-matrix simulator implemented with standard numerical linear algebra. Finite squeezing is mapped to effective logical dephasing, depolarizing noise is included at the logical level, and photon loss is treated as a heralded erasure process. This approach avoids explicit continuous-variable wavefunction simulation, hardware-specific photonic models, and quantum software frameworks, enabling transparent and computationally efficient exploration of architectural trade-offs. We perform systematic parameter sweeps over squeezing values from 8 to 16 dB, baseline loss probabilities between 0.01 and 0.03, and surface-code distances d = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Across this regime, we evaluate repeat-until-success probability, average injection overhead, and logical magic-state fidelity. We find that success probabilities exceed 0.94 across all studied parameters, with an average overhead close to unity. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach approximately 0.77 to 0.80 and show weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but a strong dependence on squeezing. Phase-boundary analysis identifies minimum squeezing requirements needed to simultaneously achieve high success probability and logical fidelity.

This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping. We explain how such rate-induced fractals appear and how the fractal dimensions of the different sets are related to each other. We illustrate our general theory in three paradigmatic systems: a piecewise linear one-dimensional map, the two-dimensional Hénon map, and a forced pendulum."}

One of these approaches is then developed in detail, up to the definition of a tailored algorithm with both theoretical guarantees and reasonable per-iteration cost. The proposed method is finally shown to outperform the standard (spectral) projected gradient method in two different experimental benchmarks, indicating that the addition of momentum terms is as beneficial in the constrained setting as it is in the unconstrained scenario."}

This paper presents challenges in the proper metrological verification of smart energy meters. It presents existing legal and normative requirements and scientific research directions regarding these meters.

This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping. We explain how such rate-induced fractals appear and how the fractal dimensions of the different sets are related to each other. We illustrate our general theory in three paradigmatic systems: a piecewise linear one-dimensional map, the two-dimensional Hénon map, and a forced pendulum."}

The binodal densities are not solely determined by a bulk (effective) free energy, but also affected by gradient terms, while capillary waves and Ostwald processes are determined by three distinct interfacial tensions. These and related phenomena were so far explained at continuum level using a top-down minimal theory (Active Model B+). This theory, by Taylor-expanding in the scalar order parameter (or density), effectively assumes that phase separation is weak, which is not true across most of the phase diagram. Here we develop a quantitative account of active phase separation, by introducing an active counterpart of Cahn-Hilliard theory, constructing the density current from all possible terms with up to four spatial derivatives without Taylor-expanding in the density. From this O(grad^4) theory, we show how to compute binodals and interfacial tensions for arbitrary choices of the five density-dependent 'coefficient functions' that specify the theory (replacing the four constant coefficients of Active Model B+). We further consider a particle model composed of thermal quorum-sensing active particles (tQSAPs) yielding a fully specified example of the O(grad^4) theory upon coarse-graining. We find that to coarse-grain consistently at O(grad^4) requires a novel procedure, based on multiple-scale analysis, to systematically eliminate fast-evolving orientational moments. Using this, we calculate from microscopic physics all five coefficient functions of the active Cahn-Hilliard theory for tQSAPs. We identify contributions that were missed in previous continuum theories, and show how neglecting them becomes justified only in the limit of large quorum-sensing range parameter. Comparison with particle simulations of tQSAPs shows that our O(grad^4) theory improves on previous continuum models [...]"}

In this work, we derive and analytically solve the low-energy Kondo theories for SVAIM at half-filling, with especial focus on the two anti-Hund's regimes: the impurity is either dominated by a valley doublet, or a trivial singlet. In the doublet regime, we reveal that a novel pair Kondo scattering $λ_x$ is required to flip the valley doublet, which involves a quartic operator of bath electrons. Our renormalization group (RG) calculation based on the Coulomb gas analog shows $λ_x$ drives a phase transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. One side of the transition is an anisotropic doublet phase, characterized by non-universal phase shifts of bath electrons and non-analytic impurity susceptibilities, while the other is a Fermi liquid formed by pair-Kondo resonance. The finite-size many-body spectrum, thermodynamic quantities, and correlation functions for both phases are analytically solved. Remarkably, the solution in the pair-Kondo Fermi liquid is achieved via the constructive approach of bosonization-refermionization along a solvable fixed line, where the many-body interaction $λ_x$ is mapped into a pseudo-fermion bilinear in a rigorous manner. Finally, we also apply the RG analysis to the singlet regime, and identify a second-order phase transition between the Kondo Fermi liquid and a local singlet phase."}

Such data are increasingly ubiquitous in fields ranging from geochemistry to demography. However, analysing such data presents unique difficulties due to the intrinsic non-Euclidean nature of the sphere, and rigorous methodologies for statistical modelling, inference, and uncertainty quantification remain limited. This paper introduces a unified framework to address these three limitations for spherically embedded spatial data. We first propose a novel spherical spatial autoregressive model that leverages optimal transport geometry and then extend it to accommodate exogenous covariates. Second, for either scenario with or without covariates, we establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators and derive a distribution-free Wald test for spatial dependence, complemented by a bootstrap procedure to enhance finite-sample performance. Third, we contribute a novel approach to uncertainty quantification by developing a conformal prediction procedure specifically tailored to spherically embedded spatial data. The practical utility of these methodological advances is illustrated through extensive simulations and applications to Spanish geochemical compositions and Japanese age-at-death mortality distributions."}

By retraining on data derived from the hybrid simulation, the error caused by the neural network over multiple time-steps can be minimized without the need for a differentiable numerical solver. Furthermore, we compare multiple neural network architectures, including recurrent neural networks and Transformers, and study their ability to utilize more information from an increased temporal and spatial receptive field.

We characterize a sharp phase transition behavior for the vEB estimator -- namely that it is information theoretically optimal (in terms of limiting variance) up to $p=o(n^{2/3})$ while it suffers from a sub-optimal convergence rate in higher dimensions. In the first regime, i.e., when $p=o(n^{2/3})$, we show how the estimated prior can be calibrated to enable valid coordinate-wise and delocalized inference, both under the \\emph{empirical Bayes posterior} and the oracle posterior.

However, explicit constructions achieving this optimal linear dependence remain elusive. Recently, Dick and Pillichshammer (2025) made significant progress by showing that a multiset union of randomly digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets almost achieve the optimal dimension dependence with high probability.\n  In this paper, we investigate the analog of this result in the setting of classical integer arithmetic using Fourier analysis. We analyze point sets constructed as multiset unions of Korobov rank-1 lattice point sets modulo a prime $N$. We provide a comprehensive analysis covering four distinct construction scenarios, combining either random or fixed integer generators with either continuous torus shifts or discrete grid shifts. We prove that in all four cases, the star discrepancy is bounded by a term of order $O(s \\log(N_{tot}) / \\sqrt{N_{tot}})$ with high probability, where $N_{tot}$ is the total number of points. This implies that the inverse of the star discrepancy for these structured sets depends quadratically on the dimension $s$.

The Kriging model is the most widely used surrogate model, with the core goal of minimizing the discrepancy between the surrogate and true models across the entire experimental domain. However, existing sequential design methods have critical limitations: observation-based batch sequential designs are rarely studied, while one-point sequential designs have insufficient information utilization and suffer from inefficient resource utilization -- they require numerous repeated observation rounds to accumulate sufficient points, leading to prolonged experimental cycles. To address these gaps, this paper proposes two novel one-point sequential design criteria and a general batch sequential design framework. Moreover, the batch sequential design framework solves the inherent point clustering problem in naive batch selection, enabling efficient extension of any sequential criterion to batch scenarios. Simulations on some test functions demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches in terms of fitting accuracy in most cases."}

A computational bottleneck in Bayesian inference for CGGMs is the evaluation of Diaconis-Ylvisaker normalizing constants, given by gamma-type integrals over cones of precision matrices with prescribed zeros and equality constraints. While explicit formulas are known for standard Gaussian graphical models only in special cases (e.g. decomposable graphs) and for a limited class of RCOP models, no general tractable framework has been available for broader families of CGGMs.\n  We introduce a new subclass of RCON models for which these normalizing constants admit closed-form expressions. On the algebraic side, we identify conditions on spaces of colored precision matrices that guarantee tractability of the associated integrals, leading to Block-Cholesky spaces (BC-spaces) and Diagonally Commutative Block-Cholesky spaces (DCBC-spaces). On the combinatorial side, we characterize the colored graphs inducing such spaces via a color perfect elimination ordering and a 2-path regularity condition, and define the resulting Color Elimination-Regular (CER) graphs and their symmetric variants. This class strictly extends decomposable graphs in the uncolored setting and contains all RCOP models associated with decomposable graphs.

Realistic modeling of such dynamics necessitates taking into account various charge and energy transfer channels involving the coupling of nuclear motion with a very large number of electronic states, leading to prohibitive cost using classical computational methods. In this work we introduce a generalization of the Anderson-Newns Hamiltonian and develop a highly optimized quantum algorithm for simulating the non-adiabatic dynamics of realistic molecule-metal interfaces. Using the PennyLane software platform, we perform resource estimations of our algorithm, showing its remarkably low implementation cost for model systems representative of various scientifically and industrially relevant molecule-metal systems. Specifically, we find that time evolution for models including $100$ metal orbitals, $8$ molecular orbitals, and $20$ nuclear degrees of freedom, requires only $271$ qubits and $7.9 \\times 10^7$ Toffoli gates for $1000$ Trotter steps, suggesting non-adiabatic molecule-metal dynamics as a fruitful application of first-generation fault-tolerant quantum computers."}

To validate our theoretical findings, we develop a molecular dynamics (MD) algorithm for directly modeling the heat bath as a gas reservoir. We first validate our approach using a 1D harmonic oscillator, calculating its length distribution through explicit numerical integration and confirming these results with MD simulations.

Such data are increasingly ubiquitous in fields ranging from geochemistry to demography. However, analysing such data presents unique difficulties due to the intrinsic non-Euclidean nature of the sphere, and rigorous methodologies for statistical modelling, inference, and uncertainty quantification remain limited. This paper introduces a unified framework to address these three limitations for spherically embedded spatial data. We first propose a novel spherical spatial autoregressive model that leverages optimal transport geometry and then extend it to accommodate exogenous covariates. Second, for either scenario with or without covariates, we establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators and derive a distribution-free Wald test for spatial dependence, complemented by a bootstrap procedure to enhance finite-sample performance. Third, we contribute a novel approach to uncertainty quantification by developing a conformal prediction procedure specifically tailored to spherically embedded spatial data. The practical utility of these methodological advances is illustrated through extensive simulations and applications to Spanish geochemical compositions and Japanese age-at-death mortality distributions."}

These one-dimensional fermionic (QSSEP) and bosonic (QSSIP) models feature stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping driven by Brownian noise, together with boundary injection and removal processes. They provide solvable microscopic settings in which quantum coherence coexists with diffusion. Upon noise averaging, their dynamics reduce to those of the classical SSEP/SSIP. We show that the cumulant generating function of the integrated current, at large scales, obeys a large deviation principle. To leading order in system size and for each noise realization, it converges to that of the corresponding classical process, establishing a classical typicality of current fluctuations in these noisy quantum systems. We further demonstrate a direct connection with Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT), showing that the large-scale equations satisfied by biased quantum densities coincide with the steady-state Hamilton equations of MFT, thereby providing a microscopic quantum justification of the MFT framework in these models. Finally, we identify the leading finite-size corrections to the current statistics. We show the existence of subleading contributions of purely quantum origin, which are absent in the corresponding classical setting, and provide their explicit expressions for the second and third current cumulants. These quantum corrections are amenable to direct experimental or numerical verification, provided sufficient control over the noise realizations can be achieved.

High estimation accuracy is achieved by shrinking noise from unimportant groups using a grouped global-local shrinkage prior. To ensure computational scalability, we approximate posterior summaries using coordinate ascent variational inference and recast the penalized credible region framework as a convex optimization problem that admits efficient computations. We prove that the resultant post-processed estimators are both parameter-consistent and variable selection consistent in high-dimensional settings.

For fields along both in-plane high-symmetry directions we observe that the spin excitation spectrum at and above a magnetic field of 8~T is gapped. Excitation modes then sharpen for increasing field but are consistently broader than experimental resolution even at 13.5~T. The out-of-plane dispersion diminishes in the 7-10~T regime, signifying enhanced two-dimensional behavior as the in-plane liquid correlations are established. In this regime, excitations are very broad and largely flat for all accessible energy-momenta, which is kinematically at odds with a magnon-decay picture. By contrast, a continuum of fractionalized excitations naturally yields a broad continuum response, which crucially may be accompanied by sharper modes of bound states of fractionalized excitations. Their damping by the continuum accounts for the observed spectral broadening and field dependence. Our results provide strong evidence for the existence of fractionalized excitations in $α$-RuCl$_3$ in a magnetic field."}

However, causal inference in nutritional epidemiology faces several challenges: (i) high-dimensional and correlated food/nutrient intake data induce massive treatment levels; (ii) nutritional studies are interested in latent dietary patterns rather than single food items; and (iii) the goal is to estimate heterogeneous causal effects of these dietary patterns on health outcomes. We address these challenges by introducing a sophisticated exposure mapping framework that reduces the high-dimensional treatment space via factor analysis and enables the identification of dietary patterns. We also extend the Bayesian Causal Forest to accommodate three ordered levels of dietary exposure, better capturing the complex structure of nutritional data and enabling estimation of heterogeneous causal effects. We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulations and apply it to a multi-center epidemiological study of Hispanic/Latino adults residing in the US. Using high-dimensional dietary data, we identify six dietary patterns and estimate their causal link with two key health risk factors: body mass index and fasting insulin levels. Our findings suggest that higher consumption of plant lipid-antioxidant, plant-based, animal protein, and dairy product patterns is associated with reduced risk."}

For example, CFTs govern emergent universal properties of systems tuned to quantum phase transitions, including their entanglement, correlations, and low-energy excitation spectra. Much of the rich structure predicted by CFTs nevertheless remains unobserved in experiment. Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments."}

In this work, we identify entanglement as the key resource that enables local random unitaries to generate global random states by effectively gluing randomness across the system. Specifically, we demonstrate that approximate random states can be produced from an entangled state $|ψ\\rangle$ through the application of local random unitaries. We show that the resulting ensemble forms an approximate state design with an error saturating as $Θ(e^{-\\mathcal{N}_2(ψ)})$, where $\\mathcal{N}_2(ψ)$ is the second Rényi entanglement entropy of $|ψ\\rangle$. Furthermore, we prove that this tight bound also applies to the second Rényi entropy of coherence when the ensemble is constructed using coherence-free operations. These results imply that, when restricted to resource-free gates, the quality of the generated random states is determined entirely by the resource content of the initial state. Notably, we find that among all $α$-Rényi entropeis, the second Rényi entropy yields the tightest bounds. Consequently, these second Rényi entropies can be interpreted as the maximal capacities for generating randomness using resource-free operations. Finally, moving beyond approximate state designs, we utilize this entanglement-assisted gluing mechanism to present a novel method for generating pseudorandom states in multipartite systems from a locally entangled state via pseudorandom unitaries in each of parties."}

To address this, this work proposes an Operator Splitting Method (OSM) based on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to decouple the geometric interface evolution from the physical field reconstruction. Within a predictor-corrector framework, the method splits the coupled system into an alternating sequence of two linear and convex subproblems: solving the diffusion equation on fixed subdomains and updating the interface geometry based on the Stefan condition. A key contribution is the formulation of both steps as linear least-squares problems; this transforms the computational strategy from a non-convex gradient-based optimization into a stable fixed-point iteration composed of alternating convex solvers. From a theoretical perspective, the relaxed iterative operator is shown to be locally contractive, and its fixed points are consistent with stationary points of the coupled residual functional. Benchmarks across 1D to 3D domains demonstrate the stability and high accuracy of the method, confirming that the proposed framework provides a highly accurate and efficient numerical solution for free boundary problems."}

Recent works have provided global convergence guarantees for VQEs under suitable local surjectivity and smoothness hypotheses, but little has been done in characterizing convergence of these algorithms when the underlying quantum circuit is affected by noise.

Yet, a robust framework to quantify local model errors is still lacking. While the local uncertainty of PCE prediction can be captured using bootstrap resampling, other methods offering more rigorous statistical guarantees are needed, especially in the context of small training datasets. Recently, conformal predictions have demonstrated strong potential in machine learning, providing statistically robust and model-agnostic prediction intervals. Due to its generality and versatility, conformal prediction is especially valuable, as it can be adapted to suit a variety of problems, making it a compelling choice for PCE-based surrogate models. In this contribution, we explore its application to PCE-based surrogate models. More precisely, we present the integration of two conformal prediction methods, namely the full conformal and the Jackknife+ approaches, into both full and sparse PCEs. For full PCEs, we introduce computational shortcuts inspired by the inherent structure of regression methods to optimize the implementation of both conformal methods. For sparse PCEs, we incorporate the two approaches with appropriate modifications to the inference strategy, thereby circumventing the non-symmetrical nature of the regression algorithm and ensuring valid prediction intervals. Our developments yield better-calibrated prediction intervals for both full and sparse PCEs, achieving superior coverage over existing approaches, such as the bootstrap, while maintaining a moderate computational cost."}

In particular, quantum thermodynamical protocols for cooling can be significantly affected, potentially altering both their performance and efficiency. Analytically characterizing the impact of such errors becomes increasingly challenging as the system size grows, particularly in deep quantum circuits where noise can accumulate in complex ways. To address this, we introduce a general framework for approximating the cumulative effect of gate-dependent noise using a global depolarizing channel. We specify the regime in which this approximation provides a reliable description of the noisy dynamics. Applying our framework to the thermodynamical two-sort algorithmic cooling (TSAC) protocol, we analytically derive its asymptotic cooling limit in the presence of noise. Using the cooling limit, the optimal cooling performance is achieved by a finite number of qubits--distinguished from the conventional noiseless TSAC protocol by an infinite number of qubits--and fundamental bounds on the achievable ground-state population are derived. This approach opens new avenues for exploring noisy quantum thermodynamical processes."}

In this work, we propose a projection-based method to enforce hard constraints and establish a state-dependent Lipschitz continuity property for the optimal MPC cost function, which enables sharp convergence analysis of the closed-loop system.

Inspired by analogous concepts in quantum state discrimination, we introduce the unambiguous randomness of a quantum state and measurement, and, relaxing the assumption of perfect accuracy, randomness with a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes. We solve these problems for any state and projective measurement in dimension two, as well as for an isotropically noisy state measured in an unbiased basis of any dimension. In the latter case, we find that, given a fixed amount of total noise, an eavesdropper correlated only to the noisy state is always outperformed by an eavesdropper with joint correlations to both a noisy state and a noisy measurement. In fact, we identify a critical error parameter beyond which the joint eavesdropper achieves perfect guessing probability, ruling out any possibility of private randomness."}

The method is formulated as a nodal-based approach using the lowest-order gradient space of the DDR complex, enriched with scalar face bubble degrees of freedom that effectively capture the normal flux across element faces. This face-bubble enrichment is crucial for ensuring sufficient approximation flexibility of the divergence field, thereby eliminating the {volumetric locking} phenomenon that typically occurs as the Lamé parameter $λ$ approaches infinity. We establish $H^1$-error estimates that are independent of $λ\\ge 0$, and depend only on the lower bound of $μ$, guaranteeing robustness across the entire range from compressible to nearly incompressible regimes. We also show how to adapt our scheme to the frictionless contact mechanics model, maintaining a locking-free estimate for the primal variable (displacement). Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed {locking-free} method delivers accurate and stable approximations on general polytopal discretizations, even when the material behaves as an incompressible medium. The flexibility and robustness of this approach make it a practical alternative to mixed formulations for engineering applications involving nearly incompressible elastic materials."}

A main reason is that the amount of relevant news changes over time and across categories. As a result, some weekly averages are based on many articles, while others rely on only a few. Existing approaches do not explicitly account for changes in data availability when measuring uncertainty. We present a Bayesian state-space framework that turns aggregated news sentiment into a smoothed time series with uncertainty. The model treats each weekly sentiment value as a noisy measurement of an underlying sentiment process, with observation uncertainty scaled by the effective information weight $n_{tj}$: when coverage is high, latent sentiment is anchored more strongly to the observed aggregate; when coverage is low, inference relies more on the latent dynamics and uncertainty increases. Using news data grouped into multiple categories, we find broadly similar latent dynamics across categories, while larger differences appear in observation noise. The framework is designed for descriptive monitoring and can be extended to other text sources where information availability varies over time."}

Standard formulations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) impose such multi-channel constraints using penalty terms, so most of the explored Hilbert space corresponds to invalid assignments. We propose a subspace-confined QAOA tailored to CBRS multi-channel allocation, in which each node-wise channel register is initialized in a Generalized Dicke state and evolved under an intra-register XY mixer. This ansatz confines the dynamics to a tensor product of Johnson graphs that exactly encode per-node Hamming-weight constraints. For an 8-node CBRS interference graph with 24 qubits, the effective search space is reduced from the full Hilbert space of size $2^{24}$ to 2916 feasible configurations. Within this subspace, the algorithm converges rapidly to low-conflict assignments without large penalty coefficients. Simulations on instances with up to eight nodes show that the proposed ansatz achieves near-optimal conflict levels and consistently outperforms standard penalty-based QAOA and a greedy classical heuristic in terms of feasibility. Noise simulations with depolarizing channels further indicate that the constraint-preserving structure maintains a high feasibility ratio in NISQ-relevant error regimes."}

Standard methods either ignore such breaks or handle them through ad-hoc dummy variables that cannot extrapolate beyond the estimation sample. We develop a Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA model augmented with a directional-shift intervention mechanism that captures structural breaks through three interpretable parameters: a unit direction vector specifying which components gain or lose share, an amplitude controlling the magnitude of redistribution, and a logistic gate governing the timing and speed of transition. The model preserves compositional constraints by construction, maintains innovation-form DARMA dynamics for short-run dependence, and produces coherent probabilistic forecasts during and after structural breaks. We establish that the directional shift corresponds to geodesic motion on the simplex and is invariant to the choice of ILR basis. A comprehensive simulation study with 400 fits across 8 scenarios demonstrates that when the shift direction is correctly identified (77.5% of cases), amplitude and timing parameters are recovered with near-zero bias, and credible intervals for the mean composition achieve nominal 80% coverage; we address the sign identification challenge through a hemisphere constraint. An empirical application to fee recognition lead-time distributions during COVID-19 compares baseline, fixed-effects, and intervention specifications in rolling forecast evaluation, demonstrating the intervention model's superior point accuracy (Aitchison distance 0.83 vs. 0.90) and calibration (87% vs. 71% coverage) during structural transitions."}

We extend the analysis presented in a previous paper of one of the author to a fully discrete setting. We do not consider only a specific set of boundary conditions, but a whole class including, e.g., Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions. Our analysis will also cover interface conditions corresponding to a Finite Element Method - Boundary Element Method (FEM-BEM) coupling. In particular, we shall focus on three classical FEM-BEM couplings, namely the Costabel, Johnson-Nédélec and Bielak-MacCamy couplings. As a remarkable outcome, the present contribution yields well-posed substructured formulations of these classical FEM-BEM couplings for wavenumbers different from classical spurious resonances. We also establish an explicit relation between the dimensions of the kernels of the initial variational formulation, the local problems and the substructured formulation. That relation especially holds for any wavenumber for the substructured formulation of Costabel FEM-BEM coupling, which allows us to prove that the latter formulation is well-posed even at spurious resonances. Besides, we introduce a systematically geometrically convergent iterative method for the Costabel FEM-BEM coupling, with estimates on the convergence speed."}

The model is formulated within the skew normal framework and employs identifiable hierarchical priors together with low rank parameterizations to ensure scalability. The skew normal's stochastic representation is considered to facilitate the computational implementation. Simulation studies show that RENeGe sk recovers compact, edge-aligned directional structure more accurately than symmetric Gaussian priors, while remaining competitive under irregular spatial patterns. An application to cancer incidence data in Southern Brazil illustrates how the proposed approach yields stable area-level estimates while preserving localized, directionally driven spatial variation."}

The underlying framework of dissipation-based weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) stabilization for high-order CG and DG approximations was introduced in our previous work. In this general framework, Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstructions are used to calculate local smoothness sensors that determine the appropriate amount of artificial viscosity for each cell. In the original version, candidate polynomials for WENO averaging are constructed using the derivative data from von Neumann neighbors. We upgrade this standard `cell-cell' reconstruction procedure by using WENO polynomials associated with mesh vertices as candidate polynomials for cell-based WENO averaging. The Hermite data of individual cells is sent to vertices of those cells, after which vertex-averaged HWENO data is sent back to cells containing the vertices. The new `cell-vertex' averaging procedure includes the data of vertex neighbors without explicitly adding them to the reconstruction stencils. It mitigates mesh imprinting and can also be used in classical HWENO limiters for DG methods. The second main novelty of the proposed approach is a quadrature-driven distribution of artificial viscosity within high-order finite elements. Replacing the linear quadrature weights by their nonlinear WENO-type counterparts, we concentrate shock-capturing dissipation near discontinuities while minimizing it in smooth portions of troubled cells. This redistribution of WENO stabilization preserves the total dissipation rate within each cell and improves local shock resolution without relying on subcell decomposition techniques. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness for high-order elements."}

We theoretically demonstrate a gate error on the order of 0.01%, within reach of current technology. This approach enables resource-efficient quantum operations and facilitates long-distance entanglement distribution, where stationary trapped-ion arrays serve as memory units and mobile ions act as communication qubits passing beside them. Our results pave the way for an alternative trapped-ion architecture beyond the QCCD paradigm."}

Building upon previous work, our method extends confidence regions to accommodate imperfect control over measurements.

We provide explicit prescriptions for quantifying the noise contribution from finite statistics and for estimating the effect of measurement imperfections.

Existing training approaches largely rely on gradient-based procedural optimization, which often suffers from slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and instability near sharp minima. In this work, we propose an alternative inverse-probability algebraic learning framework for QNNs. Instead of updating parameters through incremental gradient descent, our method treats learning as a local inverse problem in probability space, directly mapping discrepancies between predicted and target Born-rule probabilities to parameter corrections via a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian. This algebraic update is covariant, does not require learning-rate tuning, and enables rapid movement toward the vicinity of a loss minimum in a single step. We systematically compare the proposed method with gradient descent and Adam optimization in both regression and classification tasks using a teacher-student QNN benchmark. Our results show that algebraic learning converges significantly faster, escapes loss plateaus, and achieves lower final errors. Under finite-shot sampling, the method exhibits near-optimal error scaling, while remaining robust against intrinsic hardware noise such as dephasing. These findings suggest that inverse-probability algebraic learning offers a principled and practical alternative to procedural optimization for QNN training, particularly in resource-constrained near-term quantum devices."}

This has given rise to hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the quantum device performs only a small but vital part of the overall computation. Among these, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which combine a classical optimization procedure with quantum evaluation of a cost function, have emerged as particularly promising. However, barren plateaus and ill-conditioned optimization landscapes remain among the primary obstacles faced by VQAs, often leading to unstable convergence and high sensitivity to initialization. Motivated by this challenge, we investigate whether a purely classical remedy, standard L2 squared-norm regularization, can systematically stabilize hybrid quantum-classical optimization. Specifically, we augment the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) objective with a quadratic penalty proportional to the squared norm of the parameters, without modifying the quantum circuit or measurement process. Across all tested Hamiltonians, H2, LiH, and the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM), we observe improved performance over a broad window of the regularization strength. Our large-scale numerical results demonstrate that classical regularization provides a robust, system-independent mechanism for mitigating VQE instability, enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of variational quantum optimization without altering the underlying quantum circuit."}

The performance of quantum algorithms is often measured by their query complexity, which quantifies the number of oracle calls required to access the input. The main parameters determining the complexity of QLS solvers are the condition number $κ$ and sparsity $s$ of the linear system, and the target error $ε$. To date, the best known query-complexity lower bound is $Ω(κ\\log(1/ε))$, which establishes the optimality of the most recent QLS solvers. The original proof of this lower bound is attributed to Harrow and Kothari, but their result is unpublished. Furthermore, when discussing a more general lower bound including the sparsity $s$ of the linear system, it has become folklore that it should read as $Ω( κ\\sqrt{s}\\log(1/ε))$. In this work, we establish the rigorous lower bound capturing the sparsity dependence of QLS. We prove the lower bound of $Ω(κ\\sqrt{s})$ for any quantum algorithm that solves QLS with constant error.

In this paper, we develop and apply a metric by which the retargetability of the quantum compilers can be assessed. We develop and run a study to analyze key aspects regarding the retargetability of the compilers Tket, Qiskit, and ProjectQ.

This contrasts with the three-qubit scenario where many copies of biseparable states might be required for sharing genuine multipartite entanglement. We subsequently generalize our protocols to the case of an arbitrary number of parties. Our protocol does not rely on the implementation of joint measurements on the copies of states. Interestingly, the proposed construction naturally leads to the activation of genuinely nonlocal correlations, yielding a result that is stronger than genuine multipartite entanglement activation alone."}

But, despite their causal nature, they lack a meaningful physical connection to time -- and are, by and large, arguably incompatible with it without extra structure. The subclass of quantum combs which assumes an underlying process is described by the so-called process tensor framework, which has been successfully used to study and characterise non-Markovian open quantum systems. But, although process tensors are motivated by an underlying dynamics, it is not a priori clear how to connect to a continuous process tensor object mathematically -- leaving an uncomfortable conceptual gap. In this work, we take a decisive step toward remedying this situation. We introduce a fully continuous process tensor framework by showing how the discrete multi-partite Choi state becomes a field-theoretic state in bosonic Fock space, which is intrinsically and rigorously defined in the continuum. With this equipped, we lay out the core structural elements of this framework and its properties. This translation allows for an information-theoretic treatment of multi-time correlations in the continuum via the analysis of their continuous matrix product state representatives.

They provide solvable microscopic settings in which quantum coherence coexists with diffusion. Upon noise averaging, their dynamics reduce to those of the classical SSEP/SSIP.

Based on the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold of the $c=1$ compactified boson boundary conformal field theory, we construct microscopic lattice boundary terms that renormalize to the stable conformal boundary conditions,, utilizing simple current extensions and the underlying $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry to explicitly characterize the four-state Potts point. We validate these theoretical identifications via finite-size spectroscopy of the lattice energy spectra, confirming their consistency with $D_4$ symmetry and Kramers-Wannier duality. Finally, we discuss the boundary renormalization group flows among these identified fixed points to propose a global phase diagram for the boundary criticality."}
