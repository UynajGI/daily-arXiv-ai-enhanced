One remarkable property of ESFR schemes is their ability to be expressed\nequivalently as linearly filtered discontinuous Galerkin (FDG) schemes. In this\nstudy, we introduce Sobolev Stable discontinuous Galerkin (SSDG) schemes, a new\nconservative and linearly stable generalization of ESFR schemes via the FDG\nframework. Additionally, we review existing generalizations of the ESFR method\nand consider their relationship with the FDG framework. The linear properties\nof SSDG schemes are studied via Von Neumann analysis and compared to those of\nthe existing extended ESFR (EESFR) method. It is found that while SSDG and\nEESFR schemes exhibit fundamentally different dispersive and dissipative\nbehaviors, they can achieve a similar increase in CFL limit and exhibit a\nsimilar spectral order of accuracy. Moreover, it is seen that the range of\nscheme parameters over which SSDG schemes can be used to increase the explicit\ntime-stepping limit is much larger than for EESFR schemes.

First,\ndecoupling via Fenchel--Rockafellar duality is achieved, so that nonlinear\nterms are discretized by discontinuous finite element spaces, yielding\nblock-diagonal mass matrices and closed-form updates. Second, improved\nconvergence is obtained by applying transformed primal--dual (TPD) dynamics to\nthe nonlinear saddle-point system, which yields strongly monotone behavior.\nThird, efficient preconditioners are designed for the elliptic-type Schur\ncomplement arising from the separated differential operators, and multigrid\nsolvers are applied effectively. Extensive numerical experiments on elliptic\n$p$-Laplacian and nonlinear $H(\\curl)$ problems are presented, showing\nsignificant efficiency gains with global, mesh-independent convergence."}

Furthermore,\nnumerical simulations were employed to validate the experimental results from\nthe perspectives of damage evolution and peak pressure at monitoring points.\nThe main findings are as follows: The extra-depth of the cut has a significant\nnonlinear effect on the blasting outcome. As the extra-depth increases,\nblasting damage initially increases but decreases beyond a critical depth due\nto marginal effects, leading to the appearance of residual blast hole features.\nUnder experimental conditions, when the extra-depth was 15 mm, the damage\ndepth, width, and area reached their maximum values of 43.5 mm, 109.9 mm, and\n6055.2 mm, respectively, indicating optimal blasting performance. The fractal\ndamage of the specimen also exhibited a significant trend of initially\nincreasing and then decreasing. The maximum fractal damage, obtained by\nderiving the fitting curve, was 0.75, corresponding to an extra-depth of 13.7\nmm. The numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the\nexperimental findings, showing a significant downward shift in the peak\npressure points in the damage zone with increasing extra-depth. In summary, an\nappropriate extra-depth can achieve optimal borehole utilization, while an\nexcessive extra-depth can lead to residual blast hole formation at the bottom\nof the cut, reducing effectiveness.

Here, we investigate nonlinear dimensionality\nreduction techniques that reduce the problem to a sequence of low-dimensional\nLatent-Space BO (LSBO). While early LSBO methods used (linear) random\nprojections (Wang et al., 2013), building on Grosnit et al.

We propose some changes in their implementation,\noriginally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the\nalgorithm for broader optimisation purposes. We then couple LSBO with\nSequential Domain Reduction (SDR) directly in the latent space (SDR-LSBO),\nyielding an algorithm that narrows the latent search domains as evidence\naccumulates. Implemented in a GPU-accelerated BoTorch stack with Matern-5/2\nGaussian process surrogates, our numerical results show improved optimisation\nquality across benchmark tasks and that structured latent manifolds improve BO\nperformance.

Most existing approaches for strengthening the\nrelaxations of these sets rely primarily on extensions of a specific class of\nvalid inequalities, limiting both convex hull coverage and the discovery of\nfundamentally new structures. In this paper, we develop a novel convexification\nframework that reformulates chance-constrained sets as bilinear sets over a\nsimplex in a lifted space and employs a step-by-step aggregation procedure to\nderive facet-defining inequalities in the original space of variables. Our\napproach generalizes and unifies established families of valid inequalities in\nthe literature while introducing new ones that capture substantially larger\nportions of the convex hull. Main contributions include: (i) the development of\na new aggregation-based convexification technique for bilinear sets over a\nsimplex in a lower-dimensional space; (ii) the introduction of a novel bilinear\nreformulation of mixing sets with a knapsack constraint -- arising from\nsingle-row relaxations of chance constraints -- over a simplex, which enables\nthe systematic derivation of strong inequalities in the original variable\nspace; and (iii) the characterization of facet-defining inequalities within a\nunified framework that contains both existing and new families.

Most mathematical modeling problems can be formulated\nas constrained optimization. The necessary optimality condition is written as a\nfixed point problem in a Banach space. Anderson's acceleration method improves\nthe convergence of the standard fixed point iteration by minimizing the total\nsum of residuals and updating solutions through an optimal linear combination\nof a sequence of iterates. Thus, it is a form of iterative method of retard\nwhich uses the history of solutions as a reduced order element method (ROM).\nThe weights are determined optimally by the least squares problem based on the\ntotal residual. We analyze Anderson's method and the reduced order method (ROM)\nfor nonlinear least squares problems of minimizing |F(x)| squared. That is, the\nsolution is approximated by a linear combination of sequentially generated\nsolutions, and then we minimize the equation error on the linear manifold\nspanned by the iterates. We use the reduced order Gauss Newton method to solve\nthe least squares problem for |F(x)| squared on the linear solution manifold.\nFor the linear equation case it is similar to Anderson's method. Anderson's\nmethod approximates the solution to the nonlinear ROM. We consider variable\nstep size gradient and quasi Newton methods and the variable fixed point\niteration to generate the solution basis, then combine these with ROM\nacceleration. It converges very rapidly if the condition number of matrix A is\nnot large. The variable iterate with ROM acceleration is nearly optimal, and\nROM also regularizes and stabilizes the convergence. We also consider a\nrandomly overlapped Kaczmarz type method and develop an acceleration approach\nfor large scale ill posed linear systems.

A\nlayered design on a local edge server (i) abstracts actuators, (ii) enforces\nmutual exclusion of shared physical resources through an interlock with\npriority queueing, (iii) composes deterministic singular operations, and (iv)\norchestrates complete workflows as state machines in Node-RED, with\ncommunication over MQTT. The device layer uses low-cost ESP32-based gateways to\ninterface sensors and actuators, while all automation logic is offloaded to the\nserver side. As part of a larger project involving the first\nscientifically-documented integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in a maple\nsyrup boiling center, this work demonstrates the deployment of the proposed\nsystem as a case-study. Evaluation over an entire production season shows\nmedian message time of flight around one tenth of a second, command\nissuance-to-motion latencies of about two to three seconds, and command\ncompletion near six seconds dominated by actuator mechanics; operation runtimes\nspan tens of seconds to minutes. These results indicate that network and\norchestration overheads are negligible relative to process dynamics, enabling\nmodular, distributed control without compromising determinism or fault\nisolation. The approach reduces material and integration effort, supports\nportable containerized deployment, and naturally enables an edge/cloud split in\nwhich persistence and analytics are offloaded while automation remains at the\nedge."}
