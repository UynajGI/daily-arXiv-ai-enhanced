However, many COPs are NP-hard, causing the search space to grow exponentially with problem size and rendering large-scale instances computationally intractable. Conventional solvers typically treat problems as monolithic entities, leading to significant efficiency degradation as structural complexity increases. To address this issue, we propose a novel search-space decomposition method that leverages the inherent structure of variables to systematically reduce the size of the master problem. We formulate interaction costs between variables and individual variable costs as a constrained maximum cut problem and convert it into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation using penalty terms. An Ising-model solver is used to rapidly decompose the problem into independent small-scale subproblems, which are subsequently solved in parallel using mathematical optimization solvers. We validated this method on the capacitated vehicle routing problem. Results demonstrate three significant benefits: a substantial enhancement in feasible solution rates, accelerated convergence, achieving in 1 min the accuracy that the naive method required 30 min to reach, and a variable reduction of up to 95.32\\%. These findings suggest that search-space decomposition is a promising strategy for efficiently solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8c\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5229\u7528Ising\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5feb\u901f\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u56e0\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u5229\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5e26\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8c\u503c\u4f18\u5316\uff08QUBO\uff09\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Ising\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u95ee\u9898\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e26\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe95.32%\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u57281\u5206\u949f\u5185\u8fbe\u5230\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd530\u5206\u949f\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684NP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In the 1980s, Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin observed independently that computers based on quantum mechanics might enable better simulations of quantum phenomena. Their vision remained an intellectual curiosity until Peter Shor published his famous quantum algorithm for integer factoring, and shortly thereafter a proof that errors in quantum computations can be corrected. Since then, quantum computing R&D has progressed rapidly, from small-scale experiments in university physics laboratories to well-funded industrial efforts and prototypes. Hype notwithstanding, quantum computers have yet to solve scientifically or practically important problems -- a target often called quantum utility. In this article, we describe the capabilities of contemporary quantum computers, compare them to the requirements of quantum utility, and illustrate how to track progress from today to utility.

The key innovation lies in producing orthogonal perturbations that respect FuXi nonlinear dynamics, yielding structures reflecting dominant dynamical controls and physically interpretable probabilistic forecasts. Demonstrating superior deterministic and probabilistic skills over the operational Integrated Forecasting System Ensemble Prediction System, this work establishes a new paradigm combining AI computational advantages with rigorous dynamical constraints.

However, their design poses challenges including limited endurance, constrained payload capacity, and reliance on simple sensing modalities such as fixed-field-of-view, bearing-only cameras. Traditional platform-centric methods cannot capture the coupled performance, cost, and coordination trade-offs that emerge at the system-of-systems level.\n  This paper presents a mission engineering framework for early-phase design of low-SWaP-C UAV ISR architectures. The framework integrates design of experiments, multi-objective optimization, and high-fidelity simulation into a closed-loop process linking design variables to estimator-informed performance and mission cost. Candidate architectures are explored via Latin hypercube sampling and refined using a genetic algorithm, with performance evaluated through Monte Carlo trials of a federated Kalman filter benchmarked against the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound. Validation follows the Validation Square methodology, combining theoretical, empirical, and structural assessments.\n  A case study on man-overboard localization in a GNSS-denied maritime environment shows that localization accuracy saturates at sub-meter levels, while higher-cost configurations primarily add redundancy and resilience. The framework thus quantifies mission trade-offs between performance, affordability, and robustness, providing a scalable decision-support tool for contested, resource-constrained ISR missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u4f4eSWaP-C\u65e0\u4eba\u673aISR\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728ISR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7eed\u822a\u3001\u8f7d\u8377\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u67b6\u6784\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u62c9\u4e01\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u540e\u9a8cCramer-Rao\u4e0b\u754c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728GNSS\u62d2\u6b62\u7684\u6d77\u4e0a\u843d\u6c34\u4eba\u5458\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe\u4e9a\u7c73\u7ea7\u5e76\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3b\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684ISR\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

The choice-based linear programming (CBLP) formulation provides a powerful framework for optimizing sales allocations across customer segments, yet traditional approaches often fail to solve CBLPs of huge scale (involving millions of customer choices) due to the lack of algorithmic designs that exploit problem structure. To overcome this computational bottleneck, we propose a first-order primal-dual method, SPFOM, which requires only a small computational cost per iteration, achieves a provably near-optimal convergence rate, and can be readily extended to parallel computing environments. Computational experiments demonstrate the computational and practical superiority of SPFOM over state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale linear programs. The framework is extended to a multi-period assortment optimization setting with inventory constraints, where SPFOM estimates global shadow prices that enhance classical bid-price control policies compared with benchmark methods such as market segment decomposition.

In this work, we tackle the problem of counting microglial cells in lumbar spinal cord cross-sections of rats by omitting cell detection and focusing only on the counting task. Manual cell counting is, however, a time-consuming task and additionally entails extensive personnel training. The classic automatic color-based methods roughly inform about the total labeled area and intensity (protein quantification) but do not specifically provide information on cell number. Since the images to be analyzed have a high resolution but a huge amount of pixels contain just noise or artifacts, we first perform a pre-processing generating several filtered images {(providing a tailored, efficient feature extraction)}. Then, we design an automatic kernel counter that is a non-parametric and non-linear method. The proposed scheme can be easily trained in small datasets since, in its basic version, it relies only on one hyper-parameter. However, being non-parametric and non-linear, the proposed algorithm is flexible enough to express all the information contained in rich and heterogeneous datasets as well (providing the maximum overfit if required). Furthermore, the proposed kernel counter also provides uncertainty estimation of the given prediction, and can directly tackle the case of receiving several expert opinions over the same image.

Its starting points are the Langevin equation (LE) and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). The former was introduced to climate research by Klaus Hasselmann through his stochastic climate models. While a version of the latter, formulated within the framework of linear response theory, has found wide application, the deeper origin of the relation between fluctuations and dissipation has remained inconclusive. This essay goes one step further by seeking the cause of the apparent randomness, rather than merely describing it as in the LE, and by directly linking a fluctuation-dissipation relation to the governing microscopic equations. It postulates that such a relation, also referred to as the integral fluctuation-dissipation relation (IFDR), resides in integrals of the forcings that determine microscopic evolutions (individual trajectories) of the considered system. The IFDR ensures the emergence of well-defined macroscopic quantities, such as variance and spectra, quantities that characterize the system's fluctuations, provided the system is in dynamical equilibrium with constant external forcing. It is the dissipation embodied in IFDR that renders future states uncorrelated with initial conditions, thereby generating apparent randomness. Randomness is therefore not an unphysical artifact; on the contrary, it is a fundamental property of forced-dissipative systems in dynamical equilibrium. Fluctuation phenomena in such systems must be described by two principles: the governing microscopic equations and the IFDR. The two principles are complementary but not reducible to one another.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u5019\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u79ef\u5206\u6da8\u843d-\u8017\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\uff08IFDR\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f3a\u8feb-\u8017\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u63cf\u8ff0\u6da8\u843d\u73b0\u8c61\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u89c2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0eIFDR\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u7b80\u7684\u539f\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u8d85\u8d8aLangevin\u65b9\u7a0b\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u6da8\u843d\u7684\u552f\u8c61\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u6da8\u843d\u4e0e\u8017\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u89c2\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u79ef\u5206\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6da8\u843d-\u8017\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\uff08IFDR\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5b8f\u89c2\u6da8\u843d\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u8c31\uff09\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5916\u529b\u79ef\u5206\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u90e8\u8017\u6563\u7684\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0IFDR\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6052\u5b9a\u5916\u529b\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u5230\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff1b\u8017\u6563\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u521d\u6001\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u6027\u662f\u5f3a\u8feb-\u8017\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u975e\u4eba\u4e3a\u5047\u8c61\uff1b\u5fc5\u987b\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u89c2\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0eIFDR\u624d\u80fd\u5b8c\u6574\u63cf\u8ff0\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6da8\u843d\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Stealthy hyperuniform configurations are generated using generalized cost functions that interpolate between square-lattice-like and triangular-lattice-like arrangements. Using linear spin-wave theory for the mixed-spin model, we demonstrate that triangular-lattice-like arrangements yield a larger average staggered magnetization than both random and square-lattice-like cases. This enhancement originates from sublattice effects: while the square-lattice-like configuration enforces nearest-neighbor impurities to occupy opposite sublattices due to its bipartite structure, the triangular-lattice-like arrangement allows same-sublattice nearest-neighbor pairs, thereby strengthening cooperative magnetic enhancement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u65b9\u683c\u5b50\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u78c1\u6027\u6742\u8d28\u7684\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u91cf\u5b50\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u89d2\u6676\u683c\u72b6\u7684\u9690\u5e8f\u6742\u8d28\u6392\u5e03\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5e73\u5747\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u5141\u8bb8\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u6742\u8d28\u4f4d\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u5b50\u6676\u683c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u78c1\u6027\u534f\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u548c\u9690\u5e8f\u8d85\u5747\u5300\u6742\u8d28\u6392\u5e03\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f53\u78c1\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u4e49\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u65b9\u683c\u5b50\u5230\u4e09\u89d2\u683c\u5b50\u6392\u5217\u7684\u9690\u5e8f\u8d85\u5747\u5300\u6742\u8d28\u6784\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u89d2\u683c\u5b50\u72b6\u6392\u5217\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u548c\u65b9\u683c\u5b50\u72b6\u6392\u5217\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u89d2\u683c\u5b50\u72b6\u9690\u5e8f\u8d85\u5747\u5300\u6742\u8d28\u6392\u5e03\u56e0\u5176\u5141\u8bb8\u540c\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u5bf9\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u78c1\u6027\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

To address this question, researchers sometimes control a small number of thermal zones within a larger multi-zone building, then report savings for the controlled zones only. That approach can overestimate savings by neglecting heat transfer between controlled zones and adjacent zones. This paper mathematically characterizes the overestimation error when the dynamics are linear and the objectives are linear in the thermal load, as usually holds when optimizing energy efficiency, energy costs, or emissions. Overestimation errors can be large even in seemingly innocuous situations. For example, when controlling only interior zones that have no direct thermal contact with the outdoors, all perceived savings are fictitious. This paper provides an alternative estimation method based on the controlled and adjacent zones' temperature measurements. The new method does not require estimating how much energy the building would have used under baseline operations, so it removes the additional measurement and verification challenge of accurate baseline estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u533a\u57df\u5efa\u7b51\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u63a7\u5236\u90e8\u5206\u70ed\u533a\u8fdb\u884c\u8282\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9ad8\u4f30\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e29\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f30\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u80fd\u8017\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5148\u8fdb\u63a7\u5236\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5efa\u7b51\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4f9b\u6696\u548c\u5236\u51b7\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u5ffd\u7565\u53d7\u63a7\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u76f8\u90bb\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5747\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u8282\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u8bef\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u533a\u57df\u53ca\u76f8\u90bb\u533a\u57df\u6e29\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u4f30\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f30\u8ba1\u57fa\u7ebf\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u770b\u4f3c\u65e0\u5bb3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u4e25\u91cd\u9ad8\u4f30\uff1b\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5f53\u4ec5\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u4e0e\u5ba4\u5916\u76f4\u63a5\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u5185\u533a\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u5747\u4e3a\u865a\u5047\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u6b64\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u9ad8\u4f30\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5ffd\u7565\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e29\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u57fa\u7ebf\u80fd\u8017\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6392\u653e\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

It is usually parameterized in terms of structure functions, which encode all necessary information for all kinematic regions. Moreover, the structure functions can be factorized in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and contains information on hadron resonances. On the lattice, we can calculate the corresponding matrix element of two quark-bilinear currents with a relative Euclidean time separation. The reconstruction of the hadronic tensor in Minkowski space requires appropriate dealing with the corresponding inverse problem. In our current work, we extend previous calculations on the nucleon by considering a much larger range of momentum transfers, which is inevitable in the context of structure functions. This can be achieved by using stochastic sources, which allows us to calculate the required four-point functions in a broad kinematic region. We employ a clover fermion ensemble at pion mass $m_\u03c0= 223~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and lattice spacing $a=0.085~\\mathrm{fm}$.

This thesis develops a novel MPC framework for a class of non-linear continuous-time systems governed by functional differential equations. It targets output tracking within prescribed error bounds while systematically overcoming these challenges.\n  First, we introduce funnel MPC, an algorithm eliminating reliance on terminal conditions or restrictive long prediction horizons. Utilising funnel penalty functions -- state costs penalising tracking error deviations from time-varying boundaries -- this framework ensures feasibility while rigorously enforcing tracking performance guarantees.\n  Next, we unify funnel MPC with model-free funnel feedback into a hybrid architecture. This synergises model-based optimisation with adaptive feedback compensation, achieving prescribed tracking performance despite structural model-plant mismatches, unmodelled dynamics, and unknown disturbances.\n  To further enhance predictive accuracy, we integrate a data-driven learning framework that iteratively refines the model using system measurements, improving long-term performance without compromising robustness.\n  Finally, we formalise the transition to sampled-data implementations. We derive explicit bounds on sampling rates and control effort to guarantee stability under piecewise constant control signals, a critical step for digital hardware deployment.\n  By addressing feasibility, robustness, learning, and sampling, this thesis establishes a cohesive framework for output tracking within prescribed bounds, paving the way for future advances in learning-enhanced and robust MPC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u7ec8\u7aef\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u957f\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u51fa\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u9884\u8bbe\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMPC\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u521d\u59cb\u4e0e\u9012\u5f52\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u6837\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u9884\u8bbe\u8bef\u5dee\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8f93\u51fa\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684MPC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u6f0f\u6597MPC\u201d\uff08funnel MPC\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3\u7ec8\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u6f0f\u6597\u53cd\u9988\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u7ec8\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u914d\u3001\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9884\u8bbe\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MPC\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u9c81\u68d2MPC\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Unlike classical sampling strategies, this framework does not aim for a small approximation error in the global sense but focuses on identifying and refining promising regions early on while reducing expensive full order model evaluations. The algorithm is tested on two models: a Timoshenko beam and a Kelvin cell, which ought to be optimized in terms of the system output in the frequency domain. For that, different norms of the transfer function are used as the objective function, while up to two geometrical parameters form the vector of design variables. The sampled full order models are reduced using the iterative rational Krylov algorithm and reprojected into a global basis. Subsequently, the models are parametrized by performing sparse Bayesian regression on matrix entry level of the reduced operators. Thompson sampling is carried out using the posterior distribution of the polynomial coefficients in order to account for uncertainties in the trained regression models. The strategy deployed for sample acquisition incorporates a gradient-based search on the parametrized reduced order model, which involves analytical gradients obtained via adjoint sensitivity analysis. By adding the found optimum to the sample set, the sample set is iteratively refined. Results demonstrate robust convergence towards the global optimum but highlight the computational cost introduced by the gradient-based optimization.

Gorshkov"], "title": "Robustness-Runtime Tradeoff for Quantum State Transfer", "comment": "16 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Quantum state transfer is the primitive of transporting an unknown state on one site of a lattice to another. Using power-law interactions, recent state transfer protocols achieve speedup by utilizing the intermediate ancilla sites. However, these protocols require the ancillas to be in a perfectly initialized state, which, due to noise or imperfect control, may not be the case. In this work we introduce the $\\textit{robustness}$ of a state transfer protocol, which quantifies the protocol's tolerance to error in the initial ancilla state. In the Heisenberg picture, state transfer grows operators supported on the final site such that they no longer commute with all operators on the starting site. We prove that this robustness tightly bounds the Schatten $p$-norms of these commutators between initial and final-site operators. This generalizes the known cases of $p=\\infty$ and $p=2$, which govern completely state-dependent and state-independent state transfer respectively, demonstrating that intermediate values of $p$ govern partially state-dependent state transfer. In conjunction with existing power-law light cones, our result gives new minimum runtimes for partially state-dependent protocols which, in certain regimes, are parametrically better than existing bounds. We introduce new robust state transfer protocols, charting the landscape between complete state-dependence and state-independence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u8f85\u52a9\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Heisenberg\u56fe\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0eSchatten p-\u8303\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u65b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u9650\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\u5e42\u5f8b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u8bae\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728Heisenberg\u56fe\u666f\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u521d\u672b\u7ad9\u70b9\u7b97\u7b26\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6613\u5b50\uff0c\u5229\u7528Schatten p-\u8303\u6570\u5efa\u7acb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7b97\u7b26\u975e\u5bf9\u6613\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5e42\u5f8b\u5149\u9525\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ef\u7d27\u81f4\u7ea6\u675f\u521d\u672b\u7ad9\u70b9\u7b97\u7b26\u5bf9\u6613\u5b50\u7684Schatten p-\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cp\u503c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b8c\u5168\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u6001\u72ec\u7acb\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u9525\u5f97\u5230\u65b0\u6700\u5c0f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7b97\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u666e\u9002\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4ece\u5b8c\u5168\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5230\u6001\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6297\u566a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The shortcomings of neglecting nonsmoothness in frictional and stochastic effects in modeling the dynamics of such a machining process are demonstrated. Dynamics of the tool motion is observed to exhibit rich nonlinear phenomena such as stick-slip during chatter, with stochastic perturbations in cutting forces adding further complexity, leading to the occurrence of stochastic P and D bifurcations. Measures of entropy are found to be effective in quantifying the dynamical transitions occurring in the dynamics of the tool. Subsequently, basin stability analyses, modified to account for stochasticity and time-delays, are carried out to systematically investigate the dynamics of the cutting tool across multiple surface roughness profiles of the workpiece. Basin stability analyses indicate that chatter can be controlled by restricting initial tool displacement and controlling initial workpiece surface roughness, suggesting practical strategies to improve machining outcomes for precision manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u518d\u751f\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6469\u64e6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u91d1\u5c5e\u5207\u524a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5ffd\u7565\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bf9\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5207\u524a\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5982\u98a4\u632f\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u7c98\u6ed1\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u56e0\u5207\u524a\u529b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u968f\u673aP\u5206\u5c94\u548cD\u5206\u5c94\u3002\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8003\u8651\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u6ede\u7684\u76c6\u5730\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u9650\u5236\u521d\u59cb\u5200\u5177\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u521d\u59cb\u5de5\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u98a4\u632f\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5bc6\u52a0\u5de5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u91d1\u5c5e\u5207\u524a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u98a4\u632f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6469\u64e6\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u5305\u542b\u518d\u751f\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6469\u64e6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u76c6\u5730\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u6ede\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u9762\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u7c98\u6ed1\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u7531\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684P\u5206\u5c94\u548cD\u5206\u5c94\uff1b\u71b5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u76c6\u5730\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u521d\u59cb\u5200\u5177\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u5de5\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u98a4\u632f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u5207\u524a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5de5\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u52a0\u5de5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5236\u9020\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

For this model, we prove that physical quantities on the Nishimori line (NL) can be expressed exactly in terms of those of the pure Ising model at an effective temperature on any lattice in any dimension. For example, the energy on the NL is equal to the energy of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature up to a constant and a trivial factor. More remarkably, the specific heat on the NL equals the energy, not the specific heat, of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature, again up to a constant and a trivial factor. Gauge-noninvariant quantities such as the magnetization and correlation functions are exactly equal to the corresponding quantities of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature. These exact relations imply that the leading critical behavior at that multicritical point for the disorder-correlated model is pure-Ising-like, in contrast to the conventional multicritical universality class of the standard Edwards-Anderson model.

Identifying these combinations is critical for understanding carcinogenesis and designing targeted therapies. We formalise this challenge as the Multi-Hit Cancer Driver Set Cover Problem (MHCDSCP), a binary classification problem that selects gene combinations to maximise coverage of tumor samples while minimising coverage of normal samples. Existing approaches typically rely on exhaustive search and supercomputing infrastructure. In this paper, we present constraint programming and mixed integer programming formulations of the MHCDSCP. Evaluated on real-world cancer genomics data, our methods achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while running on a single commodity CPU in under a minute. Furthermore, we introduce a column generation heuristic capable of solving small instances to optimality.

As a step towards this goal, we consider the massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models with arbitrary number of fermion flavors, $N_f$, discretized on a spatial one-dimensional lattice of size $L$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. We compute the gate complexity using the higher-order product formula and using block-encoding/qubitization and quantum singular value transformations in the limit of large $N_f$ and $L$. We also prepare the ground states of both models with excellent fidelity for system sizes up to 20 qubits with $N_f = 1,2,3,4$ using the adaptive-variational quantum imaginary time algorithm. In addition, we also classify the dynamical Lie algebras of these relativistic fermionic models and show that they belong to the same isomorphism class.

Reversibility in the thermodynamic sense is understood as entropy-preserving processes, such as in the idealized Carnot engine, whereas in integrable dynamical systems it is understood as the conservation of the action variables. Between these two idealized limits, however, where the phase space can become mixed, things are much less clear. In this work, we first determine the extent to which reversible processes are even possible in this regime. We then explore how the dissipative losses resulting from rapidly driving these kinds of systems can be fought by approximate counterdiabatic driving. Finally, we argue that much of the phenomenology should be the same for quantum many-body systems with large degeneracy in the presence of integrability breaking perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u9006\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53cd\u7edd\u70ed\u9a71\u52a8\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5feb\u901f\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u8017\u6563\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u6d4b\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5927\u7b80\u5e76\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u540c\u6837\u9002\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53ef\u9006\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53cd\u7edd\u70ed\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u8017\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53ef\u9006\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53cd\u7edd\u70ed\u9a71\u52a8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5feb\u901f\u9a71\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\u4ecd\u53ef\u903c\u8fd1\u53ef\u9006\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u542b\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

These coordinates are referred to as the non-regular part of the model. We show that in a ``pre-asymptotic'' regime in which the limiting Laplace approximation is not yet valid, the low-temperature Gibbs distribution concentrates on a neighborhood of its mode. Within this region, the distribution is a bounded perturbation of a product measure: a strongly log-concave distribution in the regular part and a one-dimensional exponential-type distribution in each coordinate of the non-regular part. Leveraging this structure, we provide a non-asymptotic sampling guarantee by analyzing the spectral gap of Langevin dynamics.

The corresponding parent Hamiltonian is shown to include (a) two-body interactions determined by the graph adjacency matrix and (b) three-body interactions over all possible 2-paths on the graph. Employing elements of graph theory, we chart the landscape of models, recovering known instances in the literature and providing numerous new examples of ground-state solvable models for which the system Hamiltonian, ground-state wavefunction, and corresponding energy eigenvalue are specified.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u57fa\u6001\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u4e49Jastrow\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u9020\u7531\u56fe\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u51b3\u5b9a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u6001\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7684Jastrow\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4f53\u548c\u4e09\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6bcd\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49Jastrow\u578b\u57fa\u6001\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e94\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5305\u542b\u7531\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u4e24\u4f53\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u6240\u67092-\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u8bba\u5206\u7c7b\u83b7\u5f97\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u53ef\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u4e0e\u7c7b\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

We recently introduced an enhanced sampling approach based on the committor function, machine-learned following a variational principle. This method combines a transition-state-oriented bias potential, expressed as a functional of the committor, with a metadynamics-like bias along a committor-based collective variable, enabling uniform exploration of reaction pathways. In its original formulation, the committor is represented by a neural network that takes physical descriptors as input and is trained by minimizing a functional involving gradients with respect to atomic coordinates, which can be computationally demanding in some cases. Here, we propose a simplified learning criterion formulated entirely in the descriptor space, which bypasses the need for explicit and costly coordinate gradients and provides a relaxed upper bound to the original variational principle. Although this approach does not formally target the exact committor, we show that it retains robust sampling performance while significantly reducing computational costs, thus enabling the study of processes that would be practically unfeasible using the original formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5bf9\u539f\u5b50\u5750\u6807\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u56e0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u74f6\u9888\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u539f\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u627f\u8bfa\u51fd\u6570\uff08committor\uff09\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u5b50\u5750\u6807\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u8be5\u51c6\u5219\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u7269\u7406\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5bf9\u539f\u5b50\u5750\u6807\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u53d8\u5206\u539f\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bbd\u677e\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u9762\u5411\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u52bf\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u627f\u8bfa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5143\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7c7b\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cd\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5747\u5300\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u4e0d\u4e25\u683c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u539f\u672c\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u727a\u7272\u4e00\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

We define a measure of operator growth in terms of subsystem operator R\u00e9nyi entropy, which provides a state-independent measure of operator growth, unlike entanglement entropies, and the usual measures of operator growth like out-of-time-order correlators. We show that the subsystem operator R\u00e9nyi entropy encodes both spatial and temporal information, and thus can directly connect to transport for a local operator related to a conserved quantity. We construct a unified Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory formalism for the time evolution of operator R\u00e9nyi entropy and entanglement entropies of initial pure states. We use the SK field theory to obtain the operator R\u00e9nyi and state entanglement entropies in terms of infinite-temperature and vacuum Keldysh Green's functions, respectively, for non-interacting systems. We apply the method to explore the connection between operator and entanglement growth, and transport in non-interacting systems with quasiperiodic and random disorder, like the one- and two-dimensional Aubry-Andr\u00e9 models and the two-dimensional Anderson model. In particular, we show that the growth of subsystem operator R\u00e9nyi entropy and state von Neumann and R\u00e9nyi entanglement entropies can capture both ballistic and sub-ballistic transport behaviors, like diffusive and anomalous diffusive transport, as well as localization in these systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b97\u7b26R\u00e9nyi\u71b5\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b97\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u4e0e\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Schwinger-Keldysh\u573a\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u548c\u968f\u673a\u65e0\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5f39\u9053\u3001\u6269\u6563\u53ca\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7b49\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b97\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8f93\u8fd0\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982OTOC\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b97\u7b26R\u00e9nyi\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684Schwinger-Keldysh\u573a\u8bba\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b97\u7b26\u548c\u6001\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u771f\u7a7aKeldysh\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u7b97\u7b26R\u00e9nyi\u71b5\u4e0e\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4Aubry-Andr\u00e9\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4e8c\u7ef4Anderson\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u71b5\u7684\u589e\u957f\u53ef\u53cd\u6620\u5f39\u9053\u3001\u6269\u6563\u3001\u53cd\u5e38\u6269\u6563\u4e43\u81f3\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b97\u7b26R\u00e9nyi\u71b5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u523b\u753b\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65e0\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u8f93\u8fd0\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u4f53\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We summarize representative verification techniques and highlight how different observation models reshape both the problem formulation and algorithmic structure. We then review principal enforcement paradigms, ranging from opacity-enforcing supervisory control to sensor activation/information release optimization and obfuscation/editing mechanisms. Beyond finite automata, we outline how opacity has been studied in richer models such as stochastic systems, timed systems, Petri nets, and continuous/hybrid dynamics, and we briefly survey applications in robotics, location privacy, and information services.

For bilevel programs it is known that the first order approach requires the convexity of the lower level program while reformulations involving the value function results in difficult optimization problems. In this paper we propose a directional first order approach which does not require the convexity of the lower level program. First, under some reasonable assumptions, we show that the lower level program can be equivalently characterized by its first order condition over a directional neighborhood. Next, for the resulting single level optimization problem, under common constraint qualifications, we establish directional necessary optimality conditions.

By analysing the likelihood for time delay inference with Gaussian process light curve models, we show that it generically develops a boundary-driven \"W\"-shape with a global maximum at the true delay and gradual rises towards the edges of the observation window. This arises because time delay estimation is intrinsically extrapolative. In practice, global samplers such as nested sampling are steered towards spurious edge modes unless strict convergence criteria are adopted. We demonstrate this with simulations and show that the effect strengthens with higher data density over a fixed time span.

Motivated by these developments, we examine the potential consequences of interfacing a Kitaev honeycomb magnet, such as $\u03b1$-RuCl$_3$, with a nearly lattice-matched vdW antiferromagnet. By combining perturbation theory, exact diagonalization, and a classical energy-minimization method, we show that an effective staggered magnetic field originating from the vdW antiferromagnet can drive a monolayer of a Kitaev material into various novel phases, including an antichiral Kitaev spin liquid, a nonmagnetic nematic phase, and different types of skyrmion crystals. We then apply first-principle simulations to assess the prospect of concretely realizing this setup in a heterobilayer of $\u03b1$-RuCl$_3$ and the easy-axis antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c06Kitaev\u8702\u7a9d\u78c1\u4f53\u4e0e\u8fd1\u6676\u683c\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u8bf1\u5bfc\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u5947\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u03b1-RuCl3/MnPS3\u5f02\u8d28\u53cc\u5c42\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u6784\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u63a7\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u80fd\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u6548\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u573a\u53ef\u9a71\u52a8\u5355\u5c42Kitaev\u6750\u6599\u8fdb\u5165\u53cd\u624b\u5f81Kitaev\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u3001\u975e\u78c1\u5411\u5217\u76f8\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u65af\u683c\u660e\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u7b49\u65b0\u76f8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u03b1-RuCl3\u4e0eMnPS3\u6784\u6210\u7684\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u4e2d\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We consider (classical simulations of) QPE circuit computations on relatively small quantum Hamiltonians ($3$ qubits) with up to $10$ phase bits of precision, using up to Trotter order $10$. We systematically study the inputs of QPE, specifically time evolution, Trotter order, Trotter steps, and initial state, and illustrate how these inputs practically determine how QPE operates. From this we outline a coherent set of quantum algorithm input and tuning guidelines. One of the notable properties we characterize is that QPE sampling of the optimal digitized phase converges to a fixed rate.

While gradient dominance has been extensively studied, continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs have largely been analyzed separately, relying on slightly different assumptions, proof strategies, and resulting guarantees. In this paper, we present a unified gradient dominance property for both continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs under mild stabilizability and detectability assumptions. Our analysis is based on a convex reformulation derived from a common Lyapunov inequality representation and a unified change-of-variables procedure. This convex-lifting perspective yields a single proof framework applicable to both time models. The unified treatment clarifies how differences between continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics influence theoretical guarantees and reveals a deeper structural symmetry between the two formulations. Numerical examples illustrate and support the theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u8d28\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c03\u8282\u5668\uff08LQR\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LQR\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u975e\u51f8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u8d28\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4LQR\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u5206\u522b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u540c\u7684\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4LQR\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u68af\u5ea6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4LQR\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Under weak smoothness conditions, we identify the asymptotic limit of the last time $\\hat \u03b8_n$ is further than $\\eps$ away from $\u03b8_0$ when $\\eps \\rightarrow 0^+$. These limits lead to the construction of sequentially fixed width confidence regions for which we find analytic approximations. The smoothness conditions we impose is that $\\hat \u03b8_n$ is to be close to a Hadamard-differentiable functional of the empirical distribution, an assumption valid for a large class of widely used statistical estimators. Similar results were derived in Hjort and Fenstad (1992, Annals of Statistics) for the case of Euclidean parameter spaces; part of the present contribution is to lift these results to situations involving parameter functionals. The apparatus we develop is also used to derive appropriate limit distributions of other quantities related to the far tail of an almost surely convergent sequence of estimators, like the number of times the estimator is more than $\\eps$ away from its target. We illustrate our results by giving a new sequential simultaneous confidence set for the cumulative hazard function based on the Nelson--Aalen estimator and investigate a problem in stochastic programming related to computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u771f\u503c\u65f6\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u504f\u79bb\u9608\u503c\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u57df\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u524d\u4eba\u7ed3\u679c\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u6cdb\u51fd\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7d2f\u79ef\u98ce\u9669\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u5e8f\u8d2f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u96c6\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f31\u5149\u6ed1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u504f\u79bb\u771f\u503c\u8d85\u8fc7\u03b5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eHadamard\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u504f\u79bb\u9608\u503c\u7684\u6700\u540e\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u6781\u9650\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u5e8f\u8d2f\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u57df\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u7d2f\u79ef\u98ce\u9669\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5e8f\u8d2f\u540c\u65f6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u96c6\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u5212\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86Hjort\u4e0eFenstad\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u51fd\u6570\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e00\u5927\u7c7b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u63a8\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

When the true posterior is intractable, it is replaced by an approximation; here we focus on variational approximations. Recent work has explored methods that learn posteriors optimized for predictive accuracy under a chosen scoring rule, while regularizing toward the prior or conventional posterior. Our work builds on an existing predictive variational inference (PVI) framework that improves prediction, but also diagnoses model deficiencies through implicit model expansion. In models where the sampling density depends on the parameters through a linear predictor, we improve the interpretability of existing PVI methods as a diagnostic tool. This is achieved by adopting PVI posteriors of Gaussian mixture form (GM-PVI) and establishing connections with plug-in prediction for mixture-of-experts models. We make three main contributions. First, we show that GM-PVI prediction is equivalent to plug-in prediction for certain mixture-of-experts models with covariate-independent weights in generalized linear models and hierarchical extensions of them. Second, we extend standard PVI by allowing GM-PVI posteriors to vary with the prediction covariate and in this case an equivalence to plug-in prediction for mixtures of experts with covariate-dependent weights is established. Third, we demonstrate the diagnostic value of this approach across several examples, including generalized linear models, linear mixed models, and latent Gaussian process models, demonstrating how the parameters of the original model must vary across the covariate space to achieve improvements in prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GM-PVI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ee3\u66ff\uff1b\u7136\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u540e\u9a8c\uff08GM-PVI\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u63d2\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55PVI\u4ee5\u5141\u8bb8\u540e\u9a8c\u968f\u9884\u6d4b\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86GM-PVI\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u5206\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "GM-PVI\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

For a single linear defect of strength $\u03b5$, we obtain an exact analytical description of the system spectrum and formulate the dephasing-induced dynamics in the eigenstate basis. We derive an approximate kinetic equation for mode populations that describes a continuous-time random walk in action space. The walk transition rates are defined by the overlap matrix encoding the spatial structure of eigenstates that can be computed exactly. Analyzing the spectral properties of the equation, we show that defect-induced localized modes act as bottlenecks that strongly slow down relaxation, with rates scaling as $\u03b5^{-2}$ for strong defects. Using large-deviation theory, we characterize rare dynamical trajectories and identify distinct relaxation pathways associated with low- and high-activity regimes in action space. We provide numerical evidence that the large-deviation function exhibits a dynamical phase transition in the limit $\u03b5\\to \\infty$. We then extend our analysis to the nonlinear case, considering a single nonlinear defect embedded in either a linear or a fully nonlinear discrete Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \\to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate \"mesoscopic\" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e861D KPZ\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\u4e2dq-TASEP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f31\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ecb\u89c2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Fredholm\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7c92\u5b50\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5927\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u5f31\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22q-TASEP\u6a21\u578b\u5728q\u21921\u4e14\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f31\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u9650\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7406\u89e3KPZ\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4ecb\u89c2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528q-TASEP\u7684Fredholm\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5f31\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u9650\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u534a\u79bb\u6563\u6216\u5168\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u978d\u70b9\u65b9\u7a0b\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6784\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176Lax\u5bf9\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4ecb\u89c2\u5f31\u566a\u58f0 regime\uff0c\u5728\u6b64 regime \u4e2d\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u4ecd\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4q-TASEP\u4e2d\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b\u6c42\u89e3\u4e86Lax\u5bf9\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u5f31\u566a\u58f0\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "q-TASEP\u5728\u5f31\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u79ef\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7531\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e14\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8be5\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\u4f9d\u7136\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u4e3aKPZ\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We formulate the covariance steering problem as the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the steady state and target Gaussian distributions. To solve the problem, we develop a solution method, hereafter referred to as the proximal gradient-based algorithm, of promoting sparsity in the structural intervention by integrating the objective into a proximal gradient framework with L1 regularization. The main contribution of this paper lies in the analytical expression of the KL divergence gradient with respect to the intervention matrix: the gradient is characterized by the solutions to two Lyapunov equations related to the state covariance equation and its adjoint. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proximal gradient-based algorithm effectively identifies sparse, structurally-constrained interventions to achieve precise covariance steering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5e72\u9884\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u6001\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408L1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86KL\u6563\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u8282\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7a33\u6001\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165L1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7a00\u758f\u5e72\u9884\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5173\u4e8e\u5e72\u9884\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faKL\u6563\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u6001\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Ralphs"], "title": "Dantzig-Wolfe and Arc-Flow Reformulations: A Systematic Comparison", "comment": null, "summary": "Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is a widely used technique for obtaining stronger relaxations in the context of branch-and-bound methods for solving integer optimization problems. Arc-Flow reformulations are a lesser known technique related to dynamic programming that has experienced a resurgence as result of the recent popularization of decision diagrams as a tool for solving integer programs. Although these two reformulation techniques arose independently, the recently proposed solution paradigm known as column elimination has revealed that they are in fact closely connected. Building on a unified formulation and notation, this study clarifies the theoretical connections and computational trade-offs between these two reformulations.\n  We first revisit the known fact that the LP relaxations of these two reformulations yield the same dual bound. We then dig deeper, establishing conditions under which valid inequalities in the original, Dantzig-Wolfe, or Arc-Flow spaces can be translated across reformulations without loss of strength, and reinterpreting iterative strengthening methods, such as decremental state-space relaxation and column elimination, through the lens of cutting planes. To assess the potential impact of these insights empirically, we benchmark both reformulations under identical conditions on the vehicle routing problem with time windows using state-of-the-art column- and cut-generation techniques. The results identify clear contrasts: the Arc-Flow reformulation benefits from faster convergence and performs best when subproblems are highly relaxed or low-dimensional, whereas the Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is more efficient when the master problem remains compact. Overall, our study provides a unified perspective and practical guidelines for choosing between Dantzig-Wolfe and Arc-Flow reformulations in large-scale integer optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Dantzig-Wolfe\u5206\u89e3\u4e0eArc-Flow\u91cd\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u677e\u5f1b\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u5bf9\u5076\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f3a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cArc-Flow\u5728\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u9ad8\u5ea6\u677e\u5f1b\u6216\u4f4e\u7ef4\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u800cDantzig-Wolfe\u5728\u4e3b\u95ee\u9898\u7d27\u51d1\u65f6\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "Dantzig-Wolfe\u5206\u89e3\u548cArc-Flow\u91cd\u6784\u662f\u6574\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e8c\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6f84\u6e05\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e24\u79cd\u91cd\u6784\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u677e\u5f1b\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u539f\u59cb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001Dantzig-Wolfe\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cArc-Flow\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u65e0\u635f\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5c06\u5217\u6d88\u9664\u3001\u51cf\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u677e\u5f1b\u7b49\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f3a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5272\u5e73\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u5e26\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5272\u5e73\u9762\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Dantzig-Wolfe\u4e0eArc-Flow\u91cd\u6784\u7684LP\u677e\u5f1b\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u754c\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u53ef\u65e0\u635f\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5217\u6d88\u9664\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5207\u5272\u5e73\u9762\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aArc-Flow\u5728\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u9ad8\u5ea6\u653e\u677e\u6216\u4f4e\u7ef4\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800cDantzig-Wolfe\u5728\u4e3b\u95ee\u9898\u4fdd\u6301\u7d27\u51d1\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "Dantzig-Wolfe\u4e0eArc-Flow\u91cd\u6784\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6574\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u91cd\u6784\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This allows the Hamiltonian topology to act as a knob for controlling Liouvillian topology and corresponding non-equilibrium dynamics, rather than being passively manipulated by system-environment exchanges. In particular, by exactly solving the Liouvillian spectrum in a class of one-dimensional dissipative lattices, we find that the Hamiltonian band topology constrains the Liouvillian spectral winding and determines the Liouvillian skin effect, provided the Hamiltonian and quantum jump operators respect the same chiral symmetry. We further demonstrate that lattice parity controls the associated bulk-boundary correspondence and the coherence properties of the steady state.

Specifically, we investigate the requisite minimal distance $\u0394$ between mean vectors to partially recover the underlying partition. While the minimax-optimal threshold for $\u0394$ is well-established, a significant gap exists between this information-theoretic limit and the performance of known polynomial-time procedures. Although this gap was recently characterized in the high-dimensional regime ($n \\leq dK$), it remains largely unexplored in the moderate-dimensional regime ($n \\geq dK$). In this manuscript, we address this regime by establishing a new low-degree polynomial lower bound for the moderate-dimensional case when $d \\geq K$. We show that while the difficulty of clustering for $n \\leq dK$ is primarily driven by dimension reduction and spectral methods, the moderate-dimensional regime involves more delicate phenomena leading to a \"non-parametric rate\". We provide a novel non-spectral algorithm matching this rate, shedding new light on the computational limits of the clustering problem in moderate dimension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4ece\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f4e\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u5339\u914d\u8be5\u7387\u7684\u975e\u8c31\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0e\u4e2d\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6781\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e2d\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08n \u2265 dK\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u4f4e\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u975e\u8c31\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u6b64\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e2d\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u96be\u5ea6\u6e90\u4e8e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ea6\u7b80\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728d \u2265 K\u7684\u4e2d\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6 regime \u4e2d\uff0c\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u5f62\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u6781\u9650\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Standard statistical frameworks often assume fixed covariate roles and exogenous predictors, limiting their utility in systems governed by dynamic behavioral or physiological processes. We develop a hierarchical joint modeling framework that unifies three key features of such systems: (i) bidirectional feedback between a binary and a continuous covariate, (ii) role reversal in which these covariates become jointly modeled outcomes at a prespecified decision phase, and (iii) a shared latent trait influencing both intermediate covariates and a final binary endpoint. The model proceeds in three phases: a feedback-driven longitudinal process, a reversal phase in which the two covariates are jointly modeled conditional on the latent trait, and an outcome model linking a binary, decision-relevant endpoint to observed and latent components. Estimation is carried out using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo supporting robust posterior estimation for models with latent structure and mixed outcome types. Simulation studies show that the model yields well calibrated coverage, small bias, and improved predictive performance compared to standard generalized linear mixed models, marginal approaches, and models that ignore feedback or latent traits. In an analysis of nationally representative U.S. panel data, the model captures the co-evolution of physical activity and body mass index and their joint influence, moderated by a latent behavioral resilience factor, on income mobility. The framework offers a flexible, practically implementable tool for analyzing longitudinal decision systems in which feedback, covariate role transition, and unmeasured capacity are central to prediction and intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u89d2\u8272\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u89d2\u8272\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u5916\u751f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u751f\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u89d2\u8272\u53cd\u8f6c\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fde\u63a5\u4e8c\u5143\u7ec8\u70b9\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eHamiltonian\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u7387\u3001\u5c0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f53\u529b\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u4f53\u91cd\u6307\u6570\u7684\u5171\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u53d7\u6f5c\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u97e7\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u6536\u5165\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u89d2\u8272\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u672a\u6d4b\u5ea6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, the realization of these phases remains limited in van der Waals materials, and the full landscape of strong correlations remains uncharted in any context. While interactions between conduction electrons and localized spins yield a well-known competition between heavy fermions (Kondo hybridization) and magnetic order (RKKY exchange), such spin-driven competition represents only part of the correlated electron phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a heavy-fermion state can also compete with charge order, such as the charge density wave (CDW) state typical in the van der Waals $4f$ rare-earth tritellurides (RTe$_3$). We exploit the spatially-extended $5f$ orbitals of $\u03b2$-UTe$_3$ to enhance Kondo hybridization compared to its isostructural RTe$_3$ cousins. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy on $\u03b2$-UTe$_3$ shows Fano resonances characteristic of the heavy fermion state, while our quasiparticle interference imaging reveals the disappearance of Fermi-level nesting and the appearance of flat bands. We extend the tritelluride tight-binding model to include Kondo coupling and quantify the Fermi surface reconstruction. Consistent with the destruction of nesting, we observe no CDW in $\u03b2$-UTe$_3$. Our expansion of the Kondo phase diagram beyond spin-mediated competition opens new possibilities for proximity-induced phase engineering in correlated van der Waals heterostructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u03b2-UTe\u2083\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6001\u4e0e\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86Kondo\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cd\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6001\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6709\u5e8f\u6001\uff08\u5982\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u96a7\u9053\u8c31\u548c\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u03b2-UTe\u2083\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e09\u78b2\u5316\u7269\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5305\u542bKondo\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230Fano\u5171\u632f\u3001\u8d39\u7c73\u80fd\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5957\u6d88\u5931\u548c\u5e73\u5e26\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u53d1\u73b0CDW\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301Kondo\u6742\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6001\u53ef\u4e0e\u7535\u8377\u5e8f\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee5\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684Kondo\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To this end, a hierarchical control framework with thrust and disturbance compensation is proposed. In particular, we first propose a perturbed fixed-wing UAV model with turbojet engine dynamics, accounting for both unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. Second, a versatile extended observer is designed to handle both unmeasurable thrust dynamics and external disturbances. Third, a hierarchical control framework is implemented using three observer-based controllers to guarantee position-tracking performance. With the proposed control strategy, we prove that the closed-loop system asymptotically converges to the desired trajectory.

A central challenge is the renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor, which is complicated by the nonlinear realization of the $O(3)$ symmetry leading to non-trivial operator mixing patterns, and by large discretization artifacts affecting the determination of renormalization constants. We present results for the renormalization constants in the non-singlet sector, employing a modified lattice action with shifted boundary conditions and defining the renormalized coupling through the gradient flow. While we obtain a precise determination of the relative mixing constant $z_T$, the overall normalization $Z_T$ remains inaccessible due to large discretization artifacts.

Oliviero"], "title": "The unbearable hardness of deciding about magic", "comment": "9 pages+30 pages of supplemental material", "summary": "Identifying the boundary between classical and quantum computation is a central challenge in quantum information. In multi-qubit systems, entanglement and magic are the key resources underlying genuinely quantum behaviour. While entanglement is well understood, magic -- essential for universal quantum computation -- remains relatively poorly characterised. Here we show that determining membership in the stabilizer polytope, which defines the free states of magic-state resource theory, requires super-exponential time $\\exp( n^2)$ in the number of qubits $n$, even approximately. We reduce the problem to solving a $3$-SAT instance on $n^2$ variables and, by invoking the exponential time hypothesis, the result follows. As a consequence, both quantifying and certifying magic are fundamentally intractable: any magic monotone for general states must be super-exponentially hard to compute, and deciding whether an operator is a valid magic witness is equally difficult. As a corollary, we establish the robustness of magic as computationally optimal among monotones. This barrier extends even to classically simulable regimes: deciding whether a state lies in the convex hull of states generated by a logarithmic number of non-Clifford gates is also super-exponentially hard. Together, these results reveal intrinsic computational limits on assessing classical simulability, distilling pathological magic states, and ultimately probing and exploiting magic as a quantum resource.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5224\u65ad\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u591a\u9762\u4f53\uff08\u5373\u65e0\u201c\u9b54\u6cd5\u201d\u6001\uff09\u662f\u8d85\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u201c\u9b54\u6cd5\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u54ea\u4e9b\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u9b54\u6cd5\uff09\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7ea0\u7f20\u5df2\u88ab\u8f83\u597d\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u201c\u9b54\u6cd5\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u5fc5\u9700\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5224\u5b9a\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b83\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5224\u65ad\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5f52\u7ea6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542bn\u00b2\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u76843-SAT\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\uff08ETH\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6c42\u89e3\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4exp(n\u00b2)\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9b54\u6cd5\u5355\u8c03\u91cf\u548c\u9b54\u6cd5\u89c1\u8bc1\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2an\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6001\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4exp(n\u00b2)\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4efb\u4f55\u901a\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u9b54\u6cd5\u5355\u8c03\u91cf\u90fd\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b97\u7b26\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9b54\u6cd5\u89c1\u8bc1\u540c\u6837\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u542b\u5bf9\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u975e\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u95e8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u51f8\u5305\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u5458\u5224\u5b9a\u4e5f\u662f\u8d85\u6307\u6570\u96be\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u9b54\u6cd5\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u91cf\u5316\u9b54\u6cd5\u3001\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5176\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5b83\uff0c\u90fd\u5c06\u9762\u4e34\u6781\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9b54\u6cd5\uff08robustness of magic\uff09\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5355\u8c03\u91cf\u4e2d\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

The formal framework for such problems is the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where risk sensitivity is introduced through a risk measure applied to the value function, with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) being a particularly significant criterion. However, solving POMDPs is computationally intractable in general, and approximate methods rely on computationally expensive simulations of future agent trajectories. This work introduces a theoretical framework for accelerating CVaR value function evaluation in POMDPs with formal performance guarantees. We derive new bounds on the CVaR of a random variable X using an auxiliary random variable Y, under assumptions relating their cumulative distribution and density functions; these bounds yield interpretable concentration inequalities and converge as the distributional discrepancy vanishes. Building on this, we establish upper and lower bounds on the CVaR value function computable from a simplified belief-MDP, accommodating general simplifications of the transition dynamics. We develop estimators for these bounds within a particle-belief MDP framework with probabilistic guarantees, and employ them for acceleration via action elimination: actions whose bounds indicate suboptimality under the simplified model are safely discarded while ensuring consistency with the original POMDP. Empirical evaluation across multiple POMDP domains confirms that the bounds reliably separate safe from dangerous policies while achieving substantial computational speedups under the simplified model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08POMDP\uff09\u4e2dCVaR\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u65b0\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u4fe1\u5ff5-MDP\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u51b3\u7b56\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7531\u4e8ePOMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u901a\u5e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cfY\uff0c\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u5176\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcCVaR\u7684\u65b0\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u4fe1\u5ff5-MDP\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684CVaR\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7c92\u5b50\u4fe1\u5ff5MDP\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d88\u9664\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u754c\u9650\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u5371\u9669\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u591a\u4e2aPOMDP\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u539fPOMDP\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aPOMDP\u4e2d\u7684CVaR\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u7684CVaR\u754c\u9650\u53ca\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d88\u9664\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Despite nearly a century of widespread use across many fields, rigorous guarantees for valid inference for the learned representation remain lacking. In this paper, we identify a surprisingly prevalent phenomenon that suggests a reason for this gap: for a broad class of vintage rotations, the resulting estimators exhibit a non-estimable bias. Because this bias is independent of the data, it fundamentally precludes the development of valid inferential procedures, including the construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. To address this challenge, we propose a novel bias-free rotation method within a general representation learning framework based on latent variables. We establish an oracle inference property for the learned sparse representations: the estimators achieve the same asymptotic variance as in the ideal setting where the latent variables are observed. To bridge the gap between theory and computation, we develop an efficient computational framework and prove that its output estimators retain the same oracle property.

In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions. These results highlight the role of quantum geometry beyond topological settings as a governing principle for conventional Mott and magnetic physics in multi-orbital and moir\u00e9 materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u5728\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u83ab\u7279\u91d1\u5c5e-\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ca\u78c1\u5e8f\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e26\u5bbd\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u83ab\u91cc\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u548c\u4f4e\u80fd\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u62d3\u6251\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5176\u5bf9\u83ab\u7279\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u5e8f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u534a\u586b\u5145\u4e14\u62d3\u6251\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u4e2d\u7684Kane-Mele-Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u83ab\u7279\u8f6c\u53d8\u548c\u78c1\u5e8f\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\u83ab\u7279\u91d1\u5c5e-\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u8f6c\u53d8\u4ee5\u53ca\u94c1\u78c1\u4e0e\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u57dfWannier\u51fd\u6570\u57fa\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5e93\u4ed1\u6563\u5c04\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u62d3\u6251\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e5f\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u83ab\u7279\u7269\u7406\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u4e2d\u8d77\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u83ab\u91cc\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This mixed phase simultaneously contains regions of both confining and deconfining states in thermal equilibrium, separated by a spatial transition. The position of the boundary between the two phases is determined by the local critical temperature. We calculate the critical temperature of the local transition as a function of angular velocity and radius for a full (imaginary) rotating system and within a local thermalization approximation, and find an excellent agreement between these approaches. An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u73b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u80f6\u5b50\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u975e\u5747\u5300\u76f8\uff0c\u8be5\u76f8\u5728\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u7981\u95ed\u548c\u53bb\u7981\u95ed\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fc7\u6e21\u5206\u9694\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u53d8\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u968f\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9e\u865a\u65cb\u8f6c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5c40\u57df\u70ed\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u89e3\u6790\u5ef6\u62d3\u81f3\u5b9e\u9891\u7387\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7981\u95ed\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u53bb\u7981\u95ed\u76f8\u9760\u8fd1\u8f6c\u8f74\u3002\u5f2f\u66f2\u5171\u8f6c\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u80f6\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8be5\u975e\u5747\u5300\u76f8\u8fdd\u80ccTolman-Ehrenfest\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u542b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5938\u514b\u7684Nf=2 QCD\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u683c\u70b9\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u65cb\u8f6c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5982Tolman-Ehrenfest\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u5947\u975e\u5747\u5300\u76f8\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u65cb\u8f6c\u80f6\u5b50\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u65cb\u8f6c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5c40\u57df\u70ed\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u5ef6\u62d3\u81f3\u5b9e\u9891\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u5c55\u9996\u4e2a\u542b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5938\u514b\uff08Nf=2 QCD\uff09\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u683c\u70b9\u6a21\u62df\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u975e\u5747\u5300\u76f8\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7981\u95ed\u4e0e\u53bb\u7981\u95ed\u6001\u5171\u5b58\u5e76\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u9694\uff1b\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u534a\u5f84\uff1b\u89e3\u6790\u5ef6\u62d3\u663e\u793a\u7981\u95ed\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5916\u56f4\u3001\u53bb\u7981\u95ed\u76f8\u9760\u8fd1\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80f6\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u79bbTolman-Ehrenfest\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff1b\u683c\u70b9\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u542b\u5938\u514b\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u8fdd\u80cc\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u975e\u5747\u5300\u76f8\uff0c\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u7531\u5171\u8f6c\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6781\u7aef\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u5f62\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

This structure preserves scale invariance and effectively handles constraints with non-integer coefficients. Then, a reduction method is developed for the lifting procedure under some conditions, further enhancing computational efficiency. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms DP with arrays in terms of both efficiency and stability, particularly for large-scale and large-capacity instances.

We additionally show that ECAV is contact preserving, and compare ECAV to traditional shock capturing artificial viscosity methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u71b5\u6821\u6b63\u4eba\u5de5\u7c98\u5ea6\uff08ECAV\uff09\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u95f4\u65adGalerkin\uff08LDG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ECAV\u7cfb\u6570\u5177\u6709$O(h)$\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u63a5\u89e6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6fc0\u6ce2\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u71b5\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6fc0\u6ce2\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53c8\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u591a\u8017\u6563\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7c98\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002ECAV\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u8017\u6563\u6821\u6b63\u9879\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728LDG\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5c1a\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u95f4\u65adGalerkin\uff08LDG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9ECAV\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7c98\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfcECAV\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u63a5\u89e6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u7c98\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ECAV\u7cfb\u6570\u5177\u6709$O(h)$\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u9650\u5236\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u8bc1\u5b9eECAV\u5177\u6709\u63a5\u89e6\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cECAV\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "ECAV\u5728LDG\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4f4e\u8017\u6563\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7c98\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

While existing procedures can achieve covariate balance, they often suffer from the shift problem. This occurs when the allocation ratios of some additional covariates deviate from the target. We show that this problem is equivalent to a mismatch between the conditional average allocation ratio and the target among units sharing specific covariate values, revealing a failure of existing procedures in the long run. To address it, we derive a new form of allocation function by requiring that balancing covariates ensures the ratio matches the target. Based on this form, we design a class of parameterized allocation functions. When the parameter roughly matches certain characteristics of the covariate distribution, the resulting procedure can balance covariates. Thus, we propose a feasible randomization procedure that updates the parameter based on collected covariate information, rendering the procedure non-Markovian. To accommodate this, we introduce a CAR framework that allows non-Markovian procedure. We then establish its key theoretical properties, including the boundedness of covariate imbalance in probability and the asymptotic distribution of the imbalance for additional covariates. Ultimately, we conclude that the feasible randomization procedure can achieve covariate balance and eliminate the shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u968f\u673a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5206\u914d\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u968f\u673a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u67d0\u4e9b\u9644\u52a0\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u504f\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u914d\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u7c7b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5206\u914d\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d2f\u79ef\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u754c\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u9644\u52a0\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u79fb\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfCAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u914d\u4e0b\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Most important figures are Fig.3 and Fig.4", "summary": "We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $\u03b8$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(\u03b8,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $\u03b8$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $\u03b8$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $\u03b8$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5173\u8054\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7684Kohn-Sham\u63cf\u8ff0\u5982\u4f55\u518d\u73b0\u591a\u4f53\u8d1d\u91cc\u76f8\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u662f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ef4SSH-Hubbard\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u548cDMRG\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5728\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u4f53\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u5e73\u5eb8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u54cd\u5e94\u3002Kohn-Sham\u4e0e\u591a\u4f53\u8d1d\u91cc\u76f8\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u7684Kohn-Sham\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u518d\u73b0\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\uff08\u5982\u8d1d\u91cc\u76f8\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bc6\u5ea6\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u968f\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4SSH-Hubbard\u73af\u72b6\u94fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165U(1)\u626d\u8f6c\u03b8\uff08\u901a\u91cf\u63d2\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\uff08DMRG\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u5168\u5468\u671f\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u8282\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6U\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u8d1d\u91cc\u76f8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u534a\u586b\u5145\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5e26\u9699\u533a\u57df\u5185\uff0c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5728\u6574\u4e2a(\u03b8,U)\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u6052\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u03b8\u6216U\uff1bKohn-Sham\u7cfb\u7edf\u9000\u5316\u4e3aSSH\u578b\u4e8c\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0eU\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u4f46\u591a\u4f53\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u975e\u5e73\u5eb8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf\u968f\u03b8\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u5728\u5927U\u4e0b\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0cKohn-Sham\u4e0e\u591a\u4f53\u8d1d\u91cc\u76f8\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u5e26\u9699\u533a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "Kohn-Sham\u4e0e\u591a\u4f53\u8d1d\u91cc\u76f8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f3a\u5236\u7684Z2\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u591a\u4f53\u8d1d\u91cc\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u51b3\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u62d3\u6251\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

We use data obtained in lattice QCD calculations performed with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) for a range of light quark masses, $1/240 \\leq m_\\ell/m_s \\leq 1/27$ for different spatial volumes ($N_\u03c3$) on Euclidean lattices with temporal extent $N_\u03c4=8$, satisfying $3\\,N_\u03c4\\leq N_\u03c3\\leq 10\\,N_\u03c4$. We observe that infinite volume extrapolated data for the order parameter agree reasonably well with the expected $O(2)$ scaling behavior even for physical ratios of the light-to-strange quark mass ratio. We quantify deviations from asymptotic scaling and perform a detailed analysis of the influence of finite-size effects in terms of temperature and quark masses at a fixed lattice cutoff. This is crucial for improving the reliability of the infinite-volume extrapolated estimate of the chiral order parameter and for a more precise determination of chiral phase transition temperature from direct Lattice QCD simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u5938\u514b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0bQCD\u4e2d\u624b\u5f81\u76f8\u53d8\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528HISQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8f7b\u5938\u514b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u683c\u70b9QCD\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u5f81\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u53ca\u76f8\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u65e0\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u5916\u63a8\u540e\u624b\u5f81\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u4ece\u683c\u70b9QCD\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u624b\u5f81\u76f8\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528HISQ\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u683c\u70b9QCD\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u8f7b\u5938\u514b\u8d28\u91cf\uff081/240 \u2264 m\u2113/ms \u2264 1/27\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f53\u79ef\uff083N\u03c4 \u2264 N\u03c3 \u2264 10N\u03c4\uff0cN\u03c4=8\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6807\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eO(2)\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u5916\u63a8\u540e\u7684\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u7684O(2)\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7684\u8f7b-\u5947\u5938\u514b\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4e5f\u6210\u7acb\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u6807\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u5938\u514b\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u683c\u70b9\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u53d6\u624b\u5f81\u76f8\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u683c\u70b9QCD\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Here we give a characterization of such states for multiple qudits of all prime dimensions by introducing a polytope of their allowed spectra. We illustrate this through the examples of one qubit, two qubits, and one qutrit. In particular, the set of absolutely stabilizer states for a single qubit is a ball inscribed in the stabilizer octahedron, but for higher dimensions the geometry is more complicated. For odd-prime-dimensional qudits, we also give a complete characterization of absolutely Wigner-positive states, i.e., states whose Wigner function remains nonnegative after conjugation by any unitary. In so doing, we show there are absolutely Wigner-positive states that are not absolutely stabilizer, which can be seen as a unitarily-invariant version of bound magic. We then study the radii of the largest balls contained in the sets of absolutely stabilizer states and absolutely Wigner-positive states. These radii respectively tell us the lowest possible purity of nonstabilizer and Wigner-negative states.

Since the mapping of causal models to the observational distribution that they induce is not one-to-one, in general, causal queries are often only partially identifiable. When binary statistical tests are used for testing partially-identifiable causal queries, their results do not translate in a straightforward manner to the causal hypothesis testing problem. We propose using ternary (three-outcome) statistical tests to test partially-identifiable causal queries. We establish testability requirements that ternary tests must satisfy in terms of uniform consistency and present equivalent topological conditions on the hypotheses. To leverage the existing toolbox of binary tests, we prove that obtaining ternary tests by combining binary tests is complete. Finally, we demonstrate how topological conditions serve as a guide to construct ternary tests for two concrete causal hypothesis testing problems, namely testing the instrumental variable (IV) inequalities and comparing treatment efficacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5143\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u6307\u5bfc\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u9a8c\u6784\u9020\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56e0\u679c\u67e5\u8be2\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5143\uff08\u4e09\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u4e09\u5143\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e09\u5143\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u6027\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u9a8c\u6784\u9020\u4e09\u5143\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u5143\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u9a8c\u6709\u6548\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08TDOS\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u96c6\u4f53\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8c31\u91cd\u7ec4\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7c92\u5b50-\u7c92\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u4ee3\u6570\u578b\u8d85\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u73bb\u8272\u80f6\u6216\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\u5373\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u91ca\u8d85\u5bfc\u7a79\u9876\u548cUemura\u6807\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u963b\u5c3c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8017\u6563\uff08\u5982Ohmic Landau\u963b\u5c3c\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7ea2\u5916\u96c6\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-De Dominicis\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u96c6\u4f53 susceptibility \u5173\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08TDOS\uff09\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8c31\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u7ea2\u5916TDOS\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6838\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u7ea2\u5916TDOS\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e00\u7c7b\u65b0\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\uff0c\u5176\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6838\u957f\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3aK(t)\u223c1/t\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u975e\u89e3\u6790\uff1b\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7c92\u5b50-\u7c92\u5b50\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u4f7fBCS\u548cEliashberg\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4ee3\u6570\u8d85\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\uff1bTc\u6b63\u6bd4\u4e8e\u6162\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u8c31\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u8d85\u5bfc\u7a79\u9876\u548cUemura\u6807\u5ea6\uff1b\u540c\u4e00\u6162\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e93\u4e5f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u53cd\u5e38\u6b63\u5e38\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\u957f\u65f6\u5173\u8054\u548c\u5947\u5f02\u91d1\u5c5e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8c31\u7ec4\u7ec7\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u7684\u4e00\u6761\u666e\u904d\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u2018\u73bb\u8272\u80f6\u2019\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure. These findings provide a unified lattice perspective on conventional and unconventional mechanisms of fermion mass generation within a single model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u7ef4\u53cc\u5473\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u4ea4\u9519\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u888b\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86(U_I, U_B)\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u96f6\u8026\u5408\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u8c03\u63a7\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e38\u89c4\u4e0e\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e38\u89c4\u4e0e\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u888b\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u56db\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08U_I \u548c U_B\uff09\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u53cc\u5473\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u4ea4\u9519\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\uff1a\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u76f8\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u7f3a\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\uff1b\u5f53UB=0\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u751f\u76f4\u63a5\u8fde\u7eed\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u6253\u5f00UB\u540e\u5206\u88c2\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u7ee7\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5c5e\u4e8eGross-Neveu\u548c3D XY\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\uff1b\u96f6\u8026\u5408\u70b9\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6676\u683c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e38\u89c4\u4e0e\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7279\u6b8a\u96f6\u8026\u5408\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Our result is quantitative in that we derive an explicit and effective construction which, in terms of only a few moduli representing quantitative witnesses to key properties of the sequence of random variables and the underlying metric space involved, provides a metastable rate of pointwise convergence, a type of generalized fluctuation bound. That quantitative result in particular relies on the development of a finitary theory of martingales, culminating in a fully finitary Robbins-Siegmund theorem. We outline how this result particularises to the circumstances of the seminal work of Combettes and Pesquet on stochastic quasi-Fej\u00e9r monotone sequences in separable Hilbert spaces, and we provide an initial application by illustrating how these results can be used to provide a metastable rate of pointwise convergence for a stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann scheme solving a stochastic common fixed point problem for nonexpansive maps over proper Hadamard spaces.

Joint inference for these quantities is challenging because their estimators are evaluated at a common, data-driven threshold estimated from both diseased and healthy samples, inducing statistical dependence. Existing approaches are largely based on parametric assumptions or fully nonparametric procedures, which may be sensitive to model misspecification or lack efficiency in moderate samples. We propose a semiparametric framework for joint inference on sensitivity and specificity at the Youden-optimal cut-off under the density ratio model. Using maximum empirical likelihood, we derive estimators of the optimal threshold and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity, and establish their joint asymptotic normality. This leads to Wald-type and range-preserving logit-transformed confidence regions. Simulation studies show that the proposed method achieves accurate coverage with improved efficiency relative to existing parametric and nonparametric alternatives across a variety of distributional settings.

In this work, we present a {\\it numerically unbiased} study of such metal-to-insulator crossover in the half-filled square-lattice Hubbard model at finite temperatures, employing auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. By jointly analyzing thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish the crossover diagram of the model in the temperature-interaction ($T$-$U$) plane. With increasing $U$, our numerical results reveal an extended crossover regime, which we refer to as the {\\it Bad Metal}, that separates the Fermi liquid and Mott insulator. During the crossover, we also examine the antiferromagnetic spin correlations and observe pronounced nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral functions. Furthermore, we investigate the temperature dependence of several commonly used observables in the model. As representative results, we achieve an accurate map of the thermal entropy across the crossover diagram, and identify the parameter regions in which the model exhibits the Pomeranchuk cooling, characterized by an adiabatic cooling with increasing $U$. Beyond offering a more refined understanding of the crossover phenomenon, our work also provides valuable benchmark and guideline for future optical lattice experiments on the square-lattice Hubbard model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u504f\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u534a\u586b\u5145\u5e73\u65b9\u6676\u683cHubbard\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ece\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u4f53\u5230Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e-\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u574f\u91d1\u5c5e\u201d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4ea4\u53c9\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u81ea\u65cb\u5173\u8054\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6-\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u56fe\u548c\u5173\u952e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u8d39\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7531\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u5230\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u4f53\u4e0eMott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u662f\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u573a\u91cf\u5b50\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u534a\u586b\u5145\u5e73\u65b9\u6676\u683cHubbard\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6-\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08T-U\uff09\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528U\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u574f\u91d1\u5c5e\u201d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4ea4\u53c9\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u52a8\u91cf\u5206\u8fa8\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u8c31\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9-\u53cd\u8282\u70b9\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\uff1b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u70ed\u71b5\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u4ea4\u53c9\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u8868\u73b0\u51faPomeranchuk\u51b7\u5374\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aHubbard\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e-\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u504f\u6570\u503c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u574f\u91d1\u5c5e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u5149\u6676\u683c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

The analysis requires adapting the variational structure to boundary conditions dictated by the physical model, which are not directly amenable to the setting in our recently developed framework for gradient flows of Riemannian spline interpolation.

Starting from a driven Caldeira-Leggett model in which an external classical field couples simultaneously to the system and reservoir degrees of freedom, we proceed without assuming that the standard equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds. The bath statistics acquire explicit dependence on the two-time autocorrelation function of the applied field, leading to drive-biased noise correlations and intrinsically non-Markovian dynamics. By eliminating the reservoir exactly at the operator level, we obtain a driven quantum generalized Langevin equation whose noise and dissipation kernels depend on two independent times. Exploiting the Gaussian nature of the driven bath, we derive a modified Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation in which the diffusion coefficients and coherent forces inherit explicit memory of the external field. We demonstrate that the physically observable oscillation frequency remains encoded in the homogeneous Green's function of the Langevin equation, while the drive-induced corrections manifest exclusively through modified diffusion and drift terms. Our results provide a unified microscopic framework for understanding field-biased fluctuation relations with direct relevance to cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments operating far from equilibrium.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fde\u7eed\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7535\u78c1\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5916\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u8017\u6563\u548c\u6269\u6563\u9879\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u5047\u8bbe\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u8861\u6da8\u843d-\u8017\u6563\u5b9a\u7406\u6210\u7acb\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u51fa\u53d1\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u8026\u5408\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u70ed\u5e93\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u9a71\u52a8Caldeira-Leggett\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d88\u9664\u50a8\u5e93\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5e26\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6838\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u91cf\u5b50\u5e7f\u4e49\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u6d74\u7684\u7279\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u7684Hu-Paz-Zhang\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8017\u6563\u6838\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u7531\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u9f50\u6b21\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u9a71\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u4ec5\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\u9879\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8fdc\u79bb\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u573a\u504f\u7f6e\u6da8\u843d\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bf9\u8154\u548c\u7535\u8def\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, a general framework for identifiability, which is critical for reliable causal inference from observational data, has yet to be advanced.

Online renewable quantile and expectile regression methods provide valuable tools for detecting such heteroscedasticity by combining current data with summary statistics from historical data.

To address this, we propose a novel online renewable method based on expectile regression, which efficiently updates estimates using both current observations and historical summaries, thereby reducing storage requirements. By exploiting the smoothness of the expectile loss function, our approach achieves superior computational efficiency compared with existing online renewable methods for streaming data with heteroscedastic variances or inhomogeneous covariate effects. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under mild regularity conditions, demonstrating that it achieves the same statistical efficiency as oracle estimators based on full individual-level data.

In this Letter, we consider open quantum systems weakly coupled to a thermal environment, in which quantum jumps are continuously monitored, and Markovian feedback is applied. Using quantum mutual information to quantify the information contribution induced by feedback, we derive a finite-time TUR for arbitrary time-integrated currents in terms of entropy production and mutual information.

In contrast to asymptotic or exponential stabilization, prescribed-time stabilization ensures convergence to equilibrium within a user-defined time that is independent of the initial condition, a property that is particularly attractive in applications with stringent transient performance requirements. The backstepping design for this problem requires solving, at each time instant, a two-dimensional time-dependent kernel Partial Differential Equation (PDE) whose solution continuously varies with the plant coefficients. The repeated numerical solution of this parabolic kernel PDE results in a prohibitive computational burden, thereby limiting real-time applicability. To overcome this limitation, we propose a neural-operator-based approximation of the mapping from the time-varying system coefficient to the corresponding backstepping kernel. The operator is trained offline using representative solutions of the kernel PDE and subsequently deployed online to generate the required time-varying kernels in real time. We establish, via Lyapunov analysis, that the resulting neural-operator-based controller preserves prescribed-time stability provided that the operator approximation error satisfies an explicit bound. Furthermore, we investigate a direct approximation of the full feedback law mapping the plant parameter functions and state measurements to the boundary control input. For this setting, we prove semiglobal practical prescribed-time stability of the closed-loop system.

In the convex zeroth-order and Voigt settings, the Voigt set is strictly tighter for intermediate volume fractions and coincides with the zeroth-order set at pure-phase endpoints, and the Voigt model reduces to an isotropic variable-thickness-sheet formulation. In the single-loadcase continuum zeroth-order problem, at least one optimal solution can be chosen orthotropic. For HS constraints, we rewrite the bound as a Voigt term minus a nonnegative correction, clarifying strict tightening for interior volume fractions and local nonconvexity. We further prove that the convex hull of the HS feasible set equals the Voigt set and derive reduced formulations via active-constraint analysis and explicit elementwise volume characterization, including reductions specialized to orthotropic effective tensors.

Parametric tail modeling with the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) has been proposed to address this issue, but existing implementations can again yield zero p-values when the estimated shape parameter is negative and the fitted distribution has a finite upper bound.\n  We introduce a method for accurate and zero-free p-value approximation in permutation testing, embedded in the permApprox workflow and R package.

In standard thermodynamic protocols involving system--bath interactions, the maximum work is given by the free-energy difference between the initial state and the corresponding Gibbs state at the bath temperature. This motivates a natural question: does information also limit work extraction in closed quantum systems that do not involve a heat bath and where work is obtained through unitary operations generated by a time-dependent Hamiltonian? While ergotropy quantifies the maximum work extractable via unitary operations, it assumes complete knowledge of the quantum state, typically requiring full state tomography. In realistic scenarios, however, only partial information is accessible. In this case, the relevant figure of merit is observational ergotropy, which depends explicitly on the measurement used to probe the system. We show that observational ergotropy decreases under classical post-processing of measurement outcomes, implying that fine-grained measurements allow greater work extraction than coarse-grained ones. Moreover, maximizing observational ergotropy over all possible measurements recovers standard ergotropy, which decomposes into incoherent (classical) and coherent (quantum) contributions.

Digital watermarking has been explored as a promising mechanism for protecting quantum circuits by embedding ownership information for tracing and verification. However, driven by recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, the paradigm of quantum circuit design is shifting from individually and manually constructed circuits to automated synthesis based on quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs). In such generative settings, protecting only individual output circuits is insufficient, and existing post hoc, circuit-centric watermarking methods are not designed to integrate with the generative process, often failing to simultaneously ensure stealthiness, functional correctness, and robustness at scale. These limitations highlight the need for a new watermarking paradigm that is natively integrated with quantum circuit generative models. In this work, we present the first watermarking framework for QCGMs, which embeds ownership signals into the generation process while preserving circuit fidelity.

Their performance is commonly quantified by three metrics: pair-collection probability, heralding efficiency, and spectral purity. In bulk-crystal SPDC, these metrics are known to be mutually constrained, yet the physical origin of the resulting trade-offs is often obscured. We show that these trade-offs originate from the frequency-dependent population of discrete spatial modes in the SPDC emission. By performing a Laguerre-Gauss mode decomposition at each frequency component, we show how spectral-spatial non-separability impacts collection probability, heralding efficiency, and purity. We apply this framework to two widely used quasi-phase-matching configurations: collinear degenerate type-0 and type-II SPDC in periodically poled bulk crystals, and quantify how different phase-matching functions shape the spectral-spatial mode structure. In particular, for type-II SPDC we compare standard periodically poled and aperiodically poled Gaussian phase matching. We experimentally validate some of our theoretical results using spatial- and spectral-projection measurements. This spectral-spatial mode analysis provides a quantitative and predictive framework for understanding and engineering bulk-crystal photon sources, enabling systematic multi-parameter optimization beyond qualitative design guidelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here, we introduce quantum confocal microscopy in Fock space that simultaneously resolves both challenges. Drawing a direct analogy between classical wave optics and quantum state evolution in a bosonic mode, we construct a confocal system with two Fock-space lenses. The first lens deterministically focuses a coherent state into a quantum probe with a tightly concentrated photon-number distribution, while the second lens maps the metrological information back to the vacuum state for efficient readout. Using a superconducting circuit QED platform, we prepare focused probe states with mean photon numbers up to ${N} = 500$, achieving a 21.5$\\pm$1.1 dB compression of the photon-number uncertainty relative to a coherent state, with a scalable quantum circuit of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operational depth. We demonstrate a displacement sensitivity scaling as $N^{-0.416}$, approaching the Heisenberg scaling ($N^{-0.5}$), and achieve a record metrological gain of 19.06$\\pm$0.13 dB beyond the standard quantum limit.

A two-sided master equation yields the fidelity and quantum Fisher information (QFI) of environment states, thereby setting fundamental limits for hypothesis testing and parameter estimation under continuous monitoring. For unmonitored noise or inefficient detection, the QFI of the detectable part of the environment may be obtained from a recently derived GME acting on multiple system replicas. Tilted master equations provide the full counting statistics of quantum jumps and diffusive measurements, enabling, e.g., studies of quantum thermodynamics beyond average values. Here we focus on bosonic linear systems, governed by a quadratic Hamiltonian and linear jump operators, whose dynamics preserves Gaussianity. For Gaussian initial states, we recast a generic GME as a compact set of ordinary differential equations for the covariance matrix (a Riccati-type equation), first moments, and normalization. These equations can be integrated efficiently without Hilbert-space truncation, and admit analytical results in simple settings. We also provide specialized forms for fidelity/QFI and full counting statistics. We illustrate the formalism with a continuously monitored optical parametric oscillator, using it to determine sensitivity limits for frequency estimation and to benchmark Hasegawa's thermodynamic uncertainty relations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that determining the conditions relies on solving the perfect matching problem in graph theory. Conditions are fully determined for the 2- and 3-copy-cup gates, for group algebra codes up to weight 4, including for codes with odd check weight. These include the bivariate bicycle codes, which we show do not have the pre-orientation for either type of copy-cup gate. We show that abelian weight 4 group algebra codes satisfying the non-associative 3-copy-cup gate necessarily have a code distance of 2, whereas codes that satisfy conditions for the symmetric 3-copy-cup gate can have higher distances, and in fact also satisfy conditions for the 2-copy-cup gate.

The many-body enhancement boosts the signal-to-noise and increases the effective interaction rate, facilitating the observation of gravitationally induced entanglement and decoherence, certified by metrological witnesses based on local and collective measurements. Furthermore, we show that quantum effects induced by gravitational interaction can be simulated by trapped bimodal Bose-Einstein condensates with long-range (e.g. dipolar) coupling, providing a programmable analogue platform to explore gravitating quantum dynamics at accessible time and energy scales.

In contrast to previous protocols for this axis-agnostic rotation sensing problem that depend on difficult-to-prepare anticoherent states, the random probe states used in our protocol can be prepared via constant-depth chaotic circuits composed of random one-axis twisting pulses. We demonstrate analytically that our protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling relative to an arbitrary rotation axis that need not be a priori known. We also investigate the effects of collective and single-particle dephasing in our protocol using analytical and numerical tools.
