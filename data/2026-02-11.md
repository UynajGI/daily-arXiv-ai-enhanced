### [1] [Failure to track a stable AMOC state under rapid climate change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09964)
*René M. van Westen,Reyk Börner,Henk A. Dijkstra*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: AMOC的稳定性高度依赖于辐射强迫的变化速率，慢速强迫下AMOC可在更高升温水平下保持稳定，而快速强迫则导致其在较低升温时崩溃，表明控制辐射强迫速率对降低AMOC崩溃风险至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AMOC崩溃的升温阈值是否具有意义，并探讨其稳定性如何受辐射强迫速率和背景气候状态的影响。

Method: 通过对比不同CO2排放情景（慢速、中等和高排放）下的AMOC响应，利用慢速CO2增加实验（+0.5 ppm/yr）揭示海洋表层与内部属性的协调调整机制及其对AMOC稳定性的支持作用。

Result: 在慢速强迫下，AMOC可稳定至全球升温+5.5°C；而在中等和高排放情景下，AMOC分别在+2.2°C和+2.8°C时崩溃。识别出一种由增强蒸发和海冰减少支持的长期稳定机制。

Conclusion: AMOC的 tipping 点强烈依赖于辐射强迫路径，控制其变化速率是降低近期AMOC崩溃风险的关键。

Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a tipping element of the climate system. The current estimate of the global warming threshold for the onset of an AMOC collapse is +4C. However, such a threshold may not be meaningful because AMOC stability depends on the rate of radiative forcing and background climate state. Here, we identify an AMOC stabilising mechanism that operates on timescales longer than present-day radiative forcing increase. Slow forcing permits coherent adjustment of surface and interior ocean properties, supported by enhanced evaporation and reduced sea-ice extent, counteracting destabilising feedbacks. This mechanism is explicitly demonstrated in a slow CO2 increase experiment (+0.5 ppm/yr), in which the AMOC remains stable up to +5.5C of global warming. By contrast, under intermediate- and high-emission scenarios, the AMOC collapses at substantially lower warming levels (+2.2C and +2.8C, respectively). Our findings demonstrate the strong radiative forcing path dependence of AMOC tipping and imply that limiting the rate of radiative forcing is critical for reducing the near-term risk of an AMOC collapse.

### [2] [Optimal information deletion and Bayes' theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09061)
*Hans Montcho,Håvard Rue*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 本文从信息删除的角度重新审视贝叶斯定理，提出最优信息删除规则，并证明其与传统贝叶斯定理一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Zellner关于贝叶斯定理作为最优信息处理规则的启发，本文探讨数据移除时如何不破坏或创造信息。

Method: 采用信息删除的视角，研究后验分布更新为无数据前分布的规则，并分析其与贝叶斯定理的关系。

Result: 证明了不销毁或创建信息的最优信息删除规则与传统贝叶斯定理的应用相一致。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯定理不仅是信息更新的最优规则，也是信息删除的最优规则。

Abstract: In this same journal, Arnold Zellner published a seminal paper on Bayes' theorem as an optimal information processing rule. This result led to the variational formulation of Bayes' theorem, which is the central idea in generalized variational inference. Almost 40 years later, we revisit these ideas, but from the perspective of information deletion. We investigate rules which update a posterior distribution into an antedata distribution when a portion of data is removed. In such context, a rule which does not destroy or create information is called the optimal information deletion rule and we prove that it coincides with the traditional use of Bayes' theorem.

### [3] [Estimating causal effects of functional treatments with modified functional treatment policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09145)
*Ziren Jiang,Erjia Cui,Jared D. Huling*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的因果估计量——修正功能治疗策略（MFTP），用于功能性治疗下的因果推断，通过函数主成分分析定义无穷维空间上的平均，实现了MFTP的因果可识别性，并提出了多种估计方法，应用于NHANES加速度计数据以评估夜间活动改变对全因死亡率的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 功能性治疗下的因果推断研究尚不充分，现有方法依赖强假设且解释性有限，因此需要一种更稳健、更具解释性的因果估计框架。

Method: 提出修正功能治疗策略（MFTP）作为新估计量，利用函数主成分分析（FPCA）定义函数变量的总体平均，构建结果回归、逆概率加权和双重稳健估计器，并在温和正则条件下提供理论保证。

Result: 所提出的估计器在模拟研究中表现良好，理论性质得到验证；在NHANES数据中的应用表明，减少夜间干扰性活动和低活动持续时间可能降低全因死亡率。

Conclusion: MFTP为功能性治疗的因果推断提供了可识别、可解释的新框架，结合FPCA解决了无穷维空间平均的难题，具有良好的理论支持和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Functional data are increasingly prevalent in biomedical research. While functional data analysis has been established for decades, causal inference with functional treatments remains largely unexplored. Existing methods typically focus on estimating the causal average dose response functional (ADRF), which requires strong positivity assumptions and offers limited interpretability. In this work, we target a new causal estimand, the modified functional treatment policy (MFTP), which focuses on estimating the average potential outcome when each individual slightly modifies their treatment trajectory from the observed one. A major challenge for this new estimand is the need to define an average over an infinite-dimensional object with no density. By proposing a novel definition of the population average over a functional variable using a functional principal component analysis (FPCA) decomposition, we establish the causal identifiability of the MFTP estimand. We further derive outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimators for the MFTP, and provide theoretical guarantees under mild regularity conditions. The proposed estimators are validated through extensive simulation studies. Applying our MFTP framework to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) accelerometer data, we estimate the causal effects of reducing disruptive nighttime activity and low-activity duration on all-cause mortality.

### [4] [High Dimensional Mean Test for Shrinking Random Variables with Applications to Backtesting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09542)
*Liujun Chen,Chen Zhou*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对随样本量增加而收缩至零的高维随机变量的均值检验框架，通过在维度的重叠子集上聚合观测值来估计子集均值，并检验最大绝对均值是否偏离零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高维均值检验方法在随机变量收缩到零且存在边际渐近正态性失效的情况下表现不佳，因此需要一种更稳健、灵活的方法来处理这类问题，特别是在风险价值回测等应用场景中。

Method: 通过在维度的重叠子集上聚合观测值，估计子集均值，并基于最大绝对均值构建检验统计量；采用乘数自助法（multiplier bootstrap）逼近其分布，从而实现有效的假设检验。

Result: 该方法在高维情形下具有优良的模拟表现，能够克服简单平均中的抵消效应，且在边际渐近正态性不成立时依然有效；实证分析验证了其在风险价值回测中的实际有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的检验框架是一种灵活且强大的工具，适用于高维收缩数据的均值检验，尤其适合用于风险价值的验证与比较回测。

Abstract: We propose a high dimensional mean test framework for shrinking random variables, where the underlying random variables shrink to zero as the sample size increases. By pooling observations across overlapping subsets of dimensions, we estimate subsets means and test whether the maximum absolute mean deviates from zero. This approach overcomes cancellations that occur in simple averaging and remains valid even when marginal asymptotic normality fails. We establish theoretical properties of the test statistic and develop a multiplier bootstrap procedure to approximate its distribution. The method provides a flexible and powerful tool for the validation and comparative backtesting of value-at-risk. Simulations show superior performance in high-dimensional settings, and a real-data application demonstrates its practical effectiveness in backtesting.

### [5] [Sharp Bounds for Treatment Effect Generalization under Outcome Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09595)
*Amir Asiaee,Samhita Pal,Cole Beck,Jared D. Huling*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种敏感性分析框架，用于在跨人群推广随机试验的处理效应时，量化违反可转移性假设对结论的影响，并通过约束似然比参数Λ给出目标平均处理效应的尖锐界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当试验参与者与目标人群之间存在分布不同的未观测效应修饰因子时，传统的可转移性假设失效，因此需要一种方法来评估该假设被违背时结论的稳健性。

Method: 通过引入一个标量参数Λ≥1来约束目标人群与试验人群结果密度之间的似然比，在每个Λ下推导出目标平均处理效应的尖锐界；利用最优似然比的阈值结构，设计了一个仅需排序和重分配概率质量的闭式贪心算法。

Result: 该方法能够在O(n log n)时间内计算出一致估计量，在模拟中显示所得到的界在指定Λ范围内具有标称覆盖率，比最坏情况下的界更紧，并在多种现实的可转移性违背情形下仍保持信息性。

Conclusion: 所提出的敏感性分析框架能有效量化可转移性假设被违背时对因果推断结果的影响，提供兼具计算效率和统计稳健性的尖锐界限。

Abstract: Generalizing treatment effects from a randomized trial to a target population requires the assumption that potential outcome distributions are invariant across populations after conditioning on observed covariates. This assumption fails when unmeasured effect modifiers are distributed differently between trial participants and the target population. We develop a sensitivity analysis framework that bounds how much conclusions can change when this transportability assumption is violated. Our approach constrains the likelihood ratio between target and trial outcome densities by a scalar parameter $Λ\geq 1$, with $Λ= 1$ recovering standard transportability. For each $Λ$, we derive sharp bounds on the target average treatment effect -- the tightest interval guaranteed to contain the true effect under all data-generating processes compatible with the observed data and the sensitivity model. We show that the optimal likelihood ratios have a simple threshold structure, leading to a closed-form greedy algorithm that requires only sorting trial outcomes and redistributing probability mass. The resulting estimator runs in $O(n \log n)$ time and is consistent under standard regularity conditions. Simulations demonstrate that our bounds achieve nominal coverage when the true outcome shift falls within the specified $Λ$, provide substantially tighter intervals than worst-case bounds, and remain informative across a range of realistic violations of transportability.

### [6] [Stochastic EM Estimation and Inference for Zero-Inflated Beta-Binomial Mixed Models for Longitudinal Count Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09279)
*John Barrera,Ana Arribas-Gil,Dae-Jin Lee,Cristian Meza*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的零膨胀Beta-二项混合效应回归模型（ZIBBMR），用于分析过度分散、零膨胀的纵向计数数据，通过SAEM算法实现最大似然估计，在模拟和实际微生物组数据分析中表现出良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准计数模型无法充分处理零膨胀、过度分散且具有个体内相关的纵向计数数据，需要更灵活和鲁棒的建模方法。

Method: 构建了包含零膨胀成分、协变量固定效应和个体随机效应的ZIBBMR模型，并采用基于潜变量增广的随机逼近EM（SAEM）算法进行最大似然估计。

Result: 模拟研究表明ZIBBMR在准确性上优于简单零膨胀模型，尤其在小样本下表现优异；在微生物组数据应用中，与ZIBR模型联合使用可增强推断的稳健性。

Conclusion: ZIBBMR模型能有效应对纵向计数数据中的零膨胀、过度分散和相关性问题，结合SAEM算法实现了高效计算，为复杂生物数据提供了有力的统计工具。

Abstract: Analyzing overdispersed, zero-inflated, longitudinal count data poses significant modeling and computational challenges, which standard count models (e.g., Poisson or negative binomial mixed effects models) fail to adequately address. We propose a Zero-Inflated Beta-Binomial Mixed Effects Regression (ZIBBMR) model that augments a beta-binomial count model with a zero-inflation component, fixed effects for covariates, and subject-specific random effects, accommodating excessive zeros, overdispersion, and within-subject correlation. Maximum likelihood estimation is performed via a Stochastic Approximation EM (SAEM) algorithm with latent variable augmentation, which circumvents the model's intractable likelihood and enables efficient computation. Simulation studies show that ZIBBMR achieves accuracy comparable to leading mixed-model approaches in the literature and surpasses simpler zero-inflated count formulations, particularly in small-sample scenarios. As a case study, we analyze longitudinal microbiome data, comparing ZIBBMR with an external Zero-Inflated Beta Regression (ZIBR) benchmark; the results indicate that applying both count- and proportion-based models in parallel can enhance inference robustness when both data types are available.

### [7] [Extended Isolation Forest with feature sensitivities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09704)
*Illia Donhauzer*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 本文提出了各向异性隔离森林（AIF），一种允许对特征空间中不同方向的偏差具有可控敏感性的异常检测方法，并引入了新的方向敏感性度量来量化和调整模型敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的异常检测理论多假设所有特征的敏感性相同，而对不同特征具有可变敏感性的理论发展不足，尤其在基于隔离的方法中尚未被研究。因此，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种扩展的隔离森林——各向异性隔离森林（AIF），其能够控制对不同特征或方向偏差的敏感性；同时设计了新的方向敏感性度量方法，用于量化并根据任务需求调整敏感性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，AIF能够有效聚焦于那些偏离正常行为更重要的特征方向进行异常检测。

Conclusion: AIF为异常检测提供了更具灵活性和任务适应性的解决方案，是首个在隔离型方法中实现特征敏感性调节的尝试。

Abstract: Compared to theoretical frameworks that assume equal sensitivity to deviations in all features of data, the theory of anomaly detection allowing for variable sensitivity across features is less developed. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not yet been addressed in the context of isolation-based methods, and this paper represents the first attempt to do so. This paper introduces an Extended Isolation Forest with feature sensitivities, which we refer to as the Anisotropic Isolation Forest (AIF). In contrast to the standard EIF, the AIF enables anomaly detection with controllable sensitivity to deviations in different features or directions in the feature space. The paper also introduces novel measures of directional sensitivity, which allow quantification of AIF's sensitivity in different directions in the feature space. These measures enable adjustment of the AIF's sensitivity to task-specific requirements. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by applying it to synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the AIF enables anomaly detection that focuses on directions in the feature space where deviations from typical behavior are more important.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Selective conformal prediction aims to construct prediction sets with valid coverage for a test unit conditional on it being selected by a data-driven mechanism. While existing methods in the offline setting handle any selection mechanism that is permutation invariant to the labeled data, their extension to the online setting -- where data arrives sequentially and later decisions depend on earlier ones -- is challenged by the fact that the selection mechanism is naturally asymmetric. As such, existing methods only address a limited collection of selection mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose PErmutation-based Mondrian Conformal Inference (PEMI), a general permutation-based framework for selective conformal prediction with arbitrary asymmetric selection rules. Motivated by full and Mondrian conformal prediction, PEMI identifies all permutations of the observed data (or a Monte-Carlo subset thereof) that lead to the same selection event, and calibrates a prediction set using conformity scores over this selection-preserving reference set. Under standard exchangeability conditions, our prediction sets achieve finite-sample exact selection-conditional coverage for any asymmetric selection mechanism and any prediction model. PEMI naturally incorporates additional offline labeled data, extends to selection mechanisms with multiple test samples, and achieves FCR control with fine-grained selection taxonomies. We further work out several efficient instantiations for commonly-used online selection rules, including covariate-based rules, conformal p/e-values-based procedures, and selection based on earlier outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods across various selection rules on a real drug discovery dataset and investigate their performance via simulations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Detecting early warning signals in climatic time series is essential for anticipating critical transitions and tipping points. Common statistical indicators include increased variance and lag-one autocorrelation prior to bifurcation points. However, these indicators are sensitive to observational noise, long-term mean trends, and long-memory dependence, all of which are prevalent in climatic time series. Such effects can easily obscure genuine signals or generate spurious detections. To address these challenges, we employ a flexible Bayesian framework for modelling time-varying autocorrelation in long-range dependent time series, also accounting for time-varying variance. The approach uses a mixture of two fractional Gaussian noise processes with a time-dependent weight function to represent fractional Gaussian noise with a time-varying Hurst exponent. Inference is performed via integrated nested Laplace approximation, enabling joint estimation of mean trends and handling of irregularly sampled observations. The strengths and limitations of detecting changes in the autocorrelation is investigated in extensive simulations. Applied to real climatic data sets, we find evidence of early warning signals in a reconstructed Atlantic multidecadal variability index, while dismissing such signals for paleoclimate records spanning the Dansgaard-Oeschger events.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Population size estimation from capture-recapture data is central for studying hard-to-reach populations, incorporating auxiliary covariates to account for heterogeneous capture probabilities and recapture dependencies. However, missing attributes pose a critical methodological challenge due to reluctance to share sensitive information, data collection limitations, and imperfect record linkage. Existing approaches either ignore missingness or rely on a priori imputation, potentially introducing substantial bias. In this work, we develop a novel nonparametric estimation framework using a Missing at Random assumption to identify capture probabilities under missing covariates. Using semiparametric efficiency theory, we construct one-step estimators that combine efficiency, robustness, and finite-sample validity: they approximately achieve the nonparametric efficiency bound, accommodate flexible machine learning methods through a doubly robust structure, and provide approximately valid inference for any sample size. Simulations demonstrate substantial improvements over naive imputation approaches, with our doubly robust ML estimators maintaining valid inference even at high missingness rates where competing methods fail. We apply our methodology to re-estimate mortality in the Gaza Strip from October 7, 2023, to June 30, 2024, using three-list capture-recapture data with missing demographic information. Our approach yields more conservative yet precise estimates compared to previous methods, indicating the true death toll exceeds official statistics by approximately 26%. Our framework provides practitioners with principled tools for handling incomplete data in conflict settings and other applications with hard-to-reach populations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper proposes a new way of evaluating the accuracy and validity of probabilistic forecasts that change over time (such as an in-game win probability model, or an election forecast). Under this approach, each model to be evaluated is treated as a canonical Kelly bettor, and the models are pitted against each other in an iterative betting contest. The growth or decline of each model's bankroll serves as the evaluation metric. Under this approach, market consensus probabilities and implied model credibilities can be updated real time as each model updates, and do not require one to wait for the final outcome. Using a simulation model, it will be shown that this method is in general more accurate than traditional average log-loss and Brier score methods at distinguishing a correct model from an incorrect model. This Kelly approach is shown to have a direct mathematical and conceptual analogue to Bayesian inference, with bankroll serving as a proxy for Bayesian credibility.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In observational studies, adjusting for confounders is required if a treatment comparison is planned. A crude comparison of the primary endpoint without covariate adjustment will suffer from biases, and the addition of regression models could improve precision by incorporating imbalanced covariates and thus help make correct inference. Desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) is a patient-centric benefit-risk evaluation methodology designed for randomized clinical trials. Still, robust covariate adjustment methods could further expand the compatibility of this method in observational studies. In DOOR analysis, each participant's outcome is ranked based on pre-specified clinical criteria, where the most desirable rank represents a good outcome with no side effects and the least desirable rank is the worst possible clinical outcome. We develop a causal framework for estimating the population-level DOOR probability, via the inverse probability of treatment weighting method, G-Computation method, and a Doubly Robust method that combines both. The performance of the proposed methodologies is examined through simulations. We also perform a causal analysis of the Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) network within the Antibacterial Resistant Leadership Group (ARLG), comparing the benefit:risk between Mono-drug therapy and Combination-drug therapy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Linear mixed models are widely used for pharmaceutical stability trending when sufficient lots are available. Expiry support is typically based on whether lot-specific conditional-mean confidence limits remain within specification through a proposed expiry. These limits depend on the denominator degrees-of-freedom (DDF) method used for $t$-based inference. We document an operationally important boundary-proximal phenomenon: when a fitted random-effect variance component is close to zero, Satterthwaite DDF for conditional-mean predictions can collapse, inflating $t$ critical values and producing unnecessarily wide and sometimes nonmonotone pointwise confidence limits on scheduled time grids. In contrast, containment DDF yields stable degrees of freedom and avoids sharp discontinuities as variance components approach the boundary. Using a worked example and simulation studies, we show that DDF choice can materially change pass/fail conclusions even when observed data comfortably meet specifications. Containment-based inference with the full random-effects model provides a single modeling framework that avoids the discontinuities introduced by data-dependent model reduction at arbitrary cutoffs. When containment is unavailable, a 10\% variance-contribution reduction workflow mitigates extreme Satterthwaite behavior by simplifying the random-effects structure only when fitted contributions at the proposed expiry are negligible. An AICc step-down is also evaluated but is best treated as a sensitivity analysis, as it can be liberal when the margin between the mean trend and the specification limit at the proposed expiry is small.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有振幅编码技术在电路深度或构造实用性方面存在不足，需要更高效的量子态制备方法。

Method: 利用Tucker分解将目标量子态分解为核心张量和模式特定算子，实现多子系统的直接分解，并构建浅层电路。

Result: 该方法能够有效利用目标态的全局纠缠结构，生成较浅的确定性量子电路。

Conclusion: Q-Tucker为量子机器学习中的高效量子态制备提供了实用且可扩展的新途径。

Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a fundamental component of quantum algorithms, particularly in quantum machine learning and data processing, where classical data must be encoded efficiently into quantum states. Existing amplitude encoding techniques often rely on recursive bipartitions or tensor decompositions, which either lead to deep circuits or lack practical guidance for circuit construction. In this work, we introduce Tucker Iterative Quantum State Preparation (Q-Tucker), a novel method that adaptively constructs shallow, deterministic quantum circuits by exploiting the global entanglement structure of target states. Building upon the Tucker decomposition, our method factors the target quantum state into a core tensor and mode-specific operators, enabling direct decompositions across multiple subsystems.

*Hugo José Ribeiro*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本研究利用量子近似优化算法（QAOA）结合零噪声外推（ZNE），在IBM中等规模量子硬件上实现了巴西塞拉多生态区88变量的碳信用投资组合多目标优化，显著优于经典贪婪算法，展示了当前含噪量子设备在环境科学决策中的实际应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高生物多样性地区（如巴西塞拉多）进行碳信用投资组合优化对气候减缓至关重要，但传统方法难以兼顾碳汇、生物多样性连通性与社会影响的复杂协同关系，亟需更高效的优化手段。

Method: 采用量子近似优化算法（QAOA）结合零噪声外推（ZNE）技术，在IBM量子硬件（ibm_torino 和 ibm_fez）上求解包含88个变量的多目标领土规划问题，并通过七次独立硬件运行与经典贪婪算法对比验证性能。

Result: QAOA+ZNE方法平均投资组合得分为58.47 ± 6.98，相比经典启发式方法（44.42）提升31.6%，具有高度统计显著性（p=0.0009）和大效应量（Cohen's d=2.01）；ZNE可提供去噪后的期望值而非受噪声干扰的离散解，且13天后验证运行显示结果具有时间稳定性。

Conclusion: 在严格误差缓解支持下，当前NISQ时代量子设备已能在环境科学领域实现量子实用性，能够发现经典短视方法忽略的复杂空间协同效应，所提出的流程为高精度生态保护政策提供了可扩展的方法框架。

Abstract: Optimizing carbon credit portfolios is a critical challenge for climate mitigation, particularly in high-biodiversity biomes such as the Brazilian Cerrado. This study explores the practical application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) combined with Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) to address a multi-objective territorial planning problem. We model an 88-variable portfolio optimization involving carbon sequestration, biodiversity connectivity, and social impact metrics, executed on intermediate-scale IBM Quantum hardware (ibm_torino and ibm_fez). The results of seven independent hardware runs demonstrate that the QAOA+ZNE workflow consistently outperforms a classical greedy baseline. The quantum method achieves a mean portfolio score of 58.47 +/- 6.98, corresponding to a 31.6% improvement over the classical heuristic (44.42), with high statistical significance (p = 0.0009) and a large effect size (Cohen's d = 2.01), where ZNE yields extrapolated expectation values of the portfolio objective rather than a discrete portfolio solution without noise. A validation run conducted after a 13-day interval confirms the temporal stability of the methodology against hardware calibration drifts. These findings establish empirical quantum utility in an environmental science context, showing that current NISQ-era devices, when coupled with rigorous error mitigation, can identify complex territorial synergies that myopic classical approaches overlook. The proposed workflow provides a scalable methodological template for high-precision environmental conservation policies.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文讨论了量子理论中弱值的概念及其解释问题，指出许多关于弱值的解释存在逻辑谬误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨弱值在单个系统中的透明解释以及相关奇异主张的有效性。

Method: 通过分析历史和现有文献中的弱值解释，识别其中的推理错误。

Result: 发现许多对弱值的解释涉及多种形式的谬误推理。

Conclusion: 对弱值的某些解释性主张提出了质疑，并强调需要更严谨的逻辑基础。

Abstract: In quantum theory, a weak value is a complex number with a somewhat technical definition: it is a ratio whose numerator is the matrix element of a self-adjoint operator and whose denominator is the inner product of a corresponding pair of state vectors. Weak values first appeared in the research literature in a pair of papers in 1987 and 1988, and were originally defined as the results of a special kind of experimental protocol involving non-disturbing measurements combined with an explicit form of post-selection. In the years since, subsequent papers on weak values have produced a number of important practical spin-offs, including new methods for signal amplification and quantum-state tomography. The present work is not concerned with those practical spin-offs, but with historical and ongoing attempts to assign weak values a transparent, single-system interpretation, as well as efforts that invoke weak values to make a number of exotic claims about the properties and behavior of individual quantum systems. This paper challenges these interpretational claims by arguing that they involve several forms of fallacious reasoning.

### [17] [TC/TCL and NETFD Correspondence Principles for Information Backflow: A Structural Monotonicity Theorem and Minimal Phase Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09054)
*Koichi Nakagawa*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的结构框架来描述最小非马尔可夫松弛过程中的信息回流，通过将非马尔可夫性解释为可观测自由度与隐藏辅助部分之间的信息交换。利用投影算子主方程和非平衡热场动力学的对应原理，定义了与信息量相关的信息回流泛函，并推导出无回流的充分条件。进一步将回流分解为经典和内在热场纠缠贡献，实现了对瞬态超调和复兴现象的模型无关分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解和量化非马尔可夫过程中信息从环境回流到系统的行为，需要一个能够统一处理不同物理情景下信息流动的理论框架。

Method: 基于时间卷积(TC)和无时间卷积(TCL)投影算子主方程以及非平衡热场动力学(NETFD)的对应原理，构建了一个信息回流的功能性框架，并提出了TC到TCL的有效率提取算法。

Result: 定义了一个通用的信息回流泛函N_I并得出了无回流的充分条件；引入了回流的经典和内在热场纠缠成分的分解方法；讨论了最小的经典和量子两态模型作为解析可解的例子，恢复了Mittag-Leffler分数松弛作为普遍包络线。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个理解非马尔可夫松弛过程中信息回流的新视角，不仅有助于深入认识此类过程的本质特征，而且对于开发新的量子技术具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: We propose a unified structural framework for information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes. The central idea is to interpret non-Markovianity as an embedding phenomenon in which observable degrees of freedom exchange information with hidden auxiliary sectors. Our approach is based on two standard formalisms in nonequilibrium physics: (i) the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator master equations, and (ii) the correspondence principle of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics (NETFD), which provides a doubling construction equivalent to an embedding of density-operator dynamics into a vector evolution in an enlarged space. We define a general information-backflow functional N_I associated with an information quantity I(t) and derive sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow (N_I = 0) in terms of divisibility properties of the instantaneous TCL generator. We further introduce a decomposition of backflow into classical and intrinsic thermo-field entanglement contributions, leading to a classification of transient overshoot and revival phenomena in a model-independent manner. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are discussed as analytically tractable examples, recovering Mittag-Leffler fractional relaxation as a universal envelope. We also provide a constructive TC-to-TCL algorithm for extracting effective rates and producing phase diagrams of backflow.

### [18] [Causal Rigidity of Born-Type Probability Rules in Infinite-Dimensional Operational Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09056)
*Enso O. Torres Alegre*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文在无限维背景下，针对一类广泛的概率规则建立了操作刚性结果，证明在无超光速信号、可进行正则导引和σ仿射性三个操作要求下，唯一符合条件的概率规则是恒等映射，从而得出Born规则是满足无信号条件的唯一概率赋值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在广义概率理论框架下，何种概率规则能在操作上保持一致性，特别是在无限维量子系统中，试图从基本操作假设推导出Born规则的唯一性。

Method: 基于广义概率理论的拓扑推广，将概率定义为纯态间操作转移概率的函数，并施加无超光速信号、σ可加意义下的正则导引以及对可数制备混合的σ仿射性三个操作条件，结合冯诺依曼代数的正规态空间与GNS表示，分析可能的概率规则。

Result: 在给定的操作条件下，任何允许的概率规则必须退化为恒等映射；非线性偏差通常会导致导引场景中的可操作信号区分，而连续性与σ仿射性排除了非仿射选项，从而唯一确定Born规则。通过冯诺依曼代数与GNS表示，该结果与标准量子力学中的Born规则一致。

Conclusion: 在允许正则导引的操作理论中，Born规则是唯一满足无信号条件的概率赋值，这为量子力学中概率解释提供了强健的操作基础，并限制了对连续变量和量子场论中后量子模型的可能修改。

Abstract: We establish an operational rigidity result for a broad class of probability rules in infinite-dimensional settings, applicable under normality and steering assumptions. Starting from a topological generalization of generalized probabilistic theories, we consider probability assignments defined as functions of an operational transition probability between pure states. We show that under three operationally motivated requirements: no superluminal signaling, availability of normal steering via purification in a sigma additive sense, and sigma affinity of probabilities under countable preparation mixtures, any admissible rule within this class must reduce to the identity. In particular, nonlinear deviations generically enable operational signaling distinctions in steering scenarios, while continuity combined with sigma affinity excludes non affine alternatives. This identifies a unique causal fixed point. Within this class of probability rules, the Born rule emerges as the only assignment compatible with no signaling in operational theories admitting normal steering. We connect the operational result to standard infinite-dimensional quantum mechanics through the normal state space of von Neumann algebras and the GNS representation, recovering the conventional Born rule for projective and generalized measurements. We discuss the scope of the assumptions and implications for proposed post quantum modifications in continuous variable and quantum field theoretic regimes.

Conclusion: 局域与平移不变可观测量并不总提供相同的预测，尤其在涉及相关函数时；且在特定条件下可观察到新型的非对角本征态热化行为。

Abstract: Local observables and their translationally invariant counterparts are generally thought as providing the same predictions for experimental measurements. This is used in the context of their expectation values, which are indeed the same in clean systems (up to finite-size effects), but also in the context of their correlation functions, which need not be the same. We examine this intuition from the perspective of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Specifically, we explore the diagonal matrix elements and the spectral functions of local and translationally invariant observables in the spin-1 tilted field Ising chain with periodic and open boundary conditions. We discuss in which ways those observables are different and in which contexts they can be thought as being the same. Furthermore, we unveil a novel form of off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization in translationally invariant systems that applies to pairs of energy eigenstates with different quasimomenta.

Conclusion: 建立了非平衡量子热力学的统一且可操作的基础，澄清了量子相干在热力学中的基本作用。

Abstract: Understanding thermodynamics far from equilibrium at the quantum scale remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in the presence of quantum coherence. Here we develop a first-principles framework for nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics by integrating quantum resource theory of coherence with thermodynamic laws. We derive a previously unexplored entropy balance relation that explicitly separates entropy flux due to heat exchange from entropy production arising from the loss of quantum coherence. This formulation identifies the appropriate thermodynamic entropy in nonequilibrium quantum processes as the energy entropy associated with energy measurements, demonstrating that the von Neumann entropy does not, in general, represent thermodynamic entropy away from equilibrium. Within this framework, dynamical temperature, free energy, work, and heat are consistently defined, and both the first and second laws are shown to hold far from equilibrium. Applying the theory to an exactly solvable open quantum system, we reveal how equilibrium thermodynamics emerges dynamically in the weak-coupling limit. Our results establish a unified and operational foundation for nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and clarify the fundamental thermodynamic role of quantum coherence.

TL;DR: 研究了两个中心量子比特与作为环境的横向场伊辛链相互作用的动力学，环境在穿越量子临界点时受到量子重置（QR）影响。结果表明，强耦合下量子纠缠和量子失谐在临界点间出现显著恢复，但随QR率增加而减弱；弱耦合下则呈现单调衰减或振荡抑制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨环境经历量子相变并受随机量子重置影响时，中心量子系统中量子关联的演化行为，以理解非平衡环境下量子信息保持的可能性。

Method: 通过数值模拟分析两个中心量子比特与线性驱动穿越量子临界点的伊辛链环境相互作用，并引入随机量子重置机制，研究不同耦合强度下纠缠和量子失谐的动态演化。

Result: 强耦合下，纠缠和失谐在QCP区间内出现明显恢复，且恢复峰值随QR率指数衰减；弱耦合下无恢复现象，施加QR后两者均呈振荡抑制，振荡周期随QR率或扫描时间减小而增大。

Conclusion: 量子重置能调控环境诱导的量子关联演化，在强耦合下可短暂恢复量子关联，而在弱耦合下导致振荡抑制，揭示了非马尔可夫性和驱动速率对量子关联保持的重要影响。

Abstract: We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced.

*Piotr Wysocki,Jan Chwedeńczuk,Marcin Płodzień*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该研究展示了在粒子丢失的情况下，通过信息在多体关联中的分散（即“scrambling”）可以保护量子计量精度，使得剩余子系统超过总粒子数一半时能恢复完整的量子Fisher信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在粒子损失的情况下，纠缠带来的计量优势通常会消失，因此需要找到一种方法来保护量子计量的精度。

Method: 利用Haar随机的scrambling幺正操作，推导出在丢失粒子后剩余态的平均量子Fisher信息的精确公式，并分析其与纠缠熵律及Schmidt秩增长的关系。

Result: 发现了一个阈值现象：当剩余子系统的大小超过N/2时，能够恢复全部的量子Fisher信息，而更小的子系统则几乎不包含信息；并通过砖墙电路和混沌XX链演化两种实现方式验证了对一轴扭曲探针的保护效果。

Conclusion: Scrambling能够有效保护量子计量中的参数信息，即使在丢失高达一半粒子的情况下仍可维持高精度，为抗损量子传感提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although entanglement can boost metrological precision beyond the standard quantum limit, the advantage often disappears with particle loss. We demonstrate that scrambling safeguards precision by dispersing information about the encoded parameter into many-body correlations. For Haar-random scrambling unitaries, we derive exact formulas for the average quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state after tracing out lost particles. The result exhibits a threshold; any remaining subsystem larger than $N/2$ recovers the full QFI, while smaller subsystems contain negligible information. We link this threshold to the scrambling-induced transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement and the associated growth of the Schmidt rank. We outline two realizations -- a brickwork circuit and chaotic XX-chain evolution -- and demonstrate the protection of one-axis-twisted probes against the loss of up to half of the particles.

Conclusion: 适当选择初始态可使系统在量子 scrambling 主导前维持非平衡态，这为利用可编程量子模拟器验证非平衡动力学提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems can be nonmonotonic, with its process dependent on an initial state. We propose a numerical method to construct a low-entangled initial state that creates a ``burst''$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$a transient deviation of an observable from its thermal equilibrium value$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$at a designated time. We apply this method to demonstrate that a burst of magnetization can be realized for a nonintegrable mixed-field Ising chain on a timescale comparable to the onset of quantum scrambling. Contrary to the typical spreading of information in this regime, the created burst is accompanied by a slow or even negative entanglement growth. Analytically, we show that a burst becomes probabilistically rare after a long time. Our results suggest that a nonequilibrium state is maintained for an appropriately chosen initial state until scrambling becomes dominant. These predictions can be tested with programmable quantum simulators.

Conclusion: 强对称性从根本上重塑了耗散临界性，弱和强对称性导致不同的动力学普适类。

Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions are strongly shaped by the symmetries of the Liouvillian, yet the quantitative impact of weak and strong symmetries on critical behavior has remained unclear. We study a squeezed-photon model with single- and two-photon losses, realizing weak and strong symmetries in the simplest possible setting. The two symmetries exhibit identical Gaussian static fluctuations, whereas the order parameter and the asymptotic decay rate display distinct scaling behaviors. Our one-loop Keldysh analysis, together with cumulant-expansion numerics, reveals sharply different critical scaling with respect to the thermodynamic scaling parameter. This establishes that weak and strong symmetries lead to distinct dynamical universality classes despite originating from the same symmetry group in the closed system. Our results provide a clear quantitative demonstration that strong symmetries fundamentally reshape dissipative criticality.

Conclusion: 对角线调度是一种简洁、高效且适用于多种操作场景的综合征提取调度方案，优于传统方法，特别适合用于基于格点手术的量子计算架构。

Abstract: In the rotated surface code, hook errors (errors on auxiliary qubits midway through syndrome extraction that propagate to correlated two-qubit data errors) can reduce the circuit-level code distance by a factor of two if the extraction schedule is poorly chosen. The traditional approach uses N-shaped and Z-shaped schedules, selecting the orientation in each plaquette to avoid hook errors aligned with logical operators. However, this becomes increasingly complex within lattice surgery primitives with varied boundary geometries, and requires a 7-step schedule to avoid gate collisions. We propose the diagonal schedule, which orients hook errors along the diagonal of each plaquette. These diagonal errors crucially never align with logical operators regardless of boundary orientation, achieving full code distance. The diagonal schedule is globally uniform: all X-type plaquettes use one schedule and all Z-type plaquettes use another, eliminating geometry-dependent planning. On hardware supporting parallel measurement, reset, and gate operations, the schedule achieves a minimal period of 6 time steps, compared to 7 for the traditional approach. We demonstrate effectiveness for memory experiments, spatial junctions, spatial Hadamard gates, and patch rotation, showing equivalent or improved logical error rates while simplifying circuit construction.

Abstract: Thermodynamics is commonly presented as a theory of macroscopic systems in stable equilibrium, built upon assumptions of extensivity and scaling with system size. In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant capacities quantify the ability of a quantum channel to reliably transmit information when every component of the encoding and decoding procedure is noisy. Earlier work analyzed achievable communication rates under such noise using fault-tolerant implementations based on concatenated codes with a single logical qubit. In this work, we develop an alternative approach using concatenations of quantum Hamming codes, which offer constant space overhead by encoding many logical qubits simultaneously. We introduce modular techniques for implementing fault-tolerant circuits with quantum input/output interfaces using the concatenated quantum Hamming code. These tools enable an analysis of fault-tolerant entanglement-assisted communication that is not only simpler, but also yields substantially higher achievable communication rates than previous methods, owing to the limited noise correlations in syndrome qubits of high-rate quantum Hamming codes.

Abstract: Estimating quantum time-series such as the Loschmidt amplitude $f(t)=\langleψ|\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}Ht}|ψ\rangle$ is central to spectroscopy, Hamiltonian analysis, and many phase-estimation algorithms. Direct estimation via the Hadamard test requires controlled implementations of $\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}Ht}$, and the depth of these controlled circuits grows with $t$, making long-time estimation challenging on near-term hardware. We introduce Quantum Phaselift, a lifting-based framework that estimates the rank-one matrix $Z = f f^\dagger$ rather than estimating $f$ directly. We propose simple quantum circuits for estimating the entries of $Z$ and show that measuring only a narrow band of this matrix around the diagonal is sufficient to uniquely recover $f$. Crucially, this reformulation decouples the controlled circuit depth from the maximum evolution time to scale instead with the width of the measured band. We prove that a $O(1)$ bandwidth suffices for generic signals, leading to substantial savings in controlled operations compared to direct estimation methods. We develop three recovery algorithms with provable exact recovery in the noiseless setting and stability under measurement noise. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that high-quality recovery is possible for the 2D Fermi-Hubbard and 2D transverse-field Ising model signals of size exceeding 100 time points using only a few million measurement shots and reasonable post-processing time, making our time-series estimation techniques efficient and effective for near-term implementations.

Abstract: Although gravitational waves are now routinely observed, the detection of individual gravitons has long been regarded as impossible. Recent work, however, has demonstrated that single-graviton detection can be achieved and may be feasible in the near future. Here we show that beyond mere particle detection, these detectors provide access to the quantum state and particle statistics of gravitational waves. We show that graviton detection probabilities enable the discrimination between squeezed, coherent, and thermal radiation. We further demonstrate that the full quantum statistics contained in the second-order correlation function of the passing wave can be directly measured at the detector, independent of the weak gravitational interaction strength. Building on recent quantum-optical techniques, this capability opens the way to full quantum state tomography of Gaussian states. Our results demonstrate that single-graviton detection is not only of foundational significance but also of practical value, allowing for the characterization of quantum statistics and the states of the gravitational radiation field, which remain currently unknown.

Abstract: We provide explicit constant-depth local unitary circuits that realize general anyon permutations in Kitaev's quantum double models. This construction can be naturally understood through a correspondence between anyon permutation symmetries of two-dimensional topological orders and self-dualities in one-dimensional systems, where local gates implement self-duality transformations on the boundaries of microscopic regions. From this holographic perspective, general anyon permutations in the $D(G)$ quantum double correspond to compositions of three classes of one-dimensional self-dualities, including gauging of certain subgroups of $G$, stacking with $G$ symmetry-protected topological phases, and outer automorphisms of the group $G$. We construct circuits realizing the first class by employing self-dual unitary gauging maps, and present transversal circuits for the latter two classes.

Abstract: The many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics poses a simple question. What would reality look like if everything evolved in time according to the same quantum equations? There is an attractive consistency to treating microscopic objects, measuring devices, and observers all on the same footing, but do the predictions match our observations? Here, we build a model for a bolometer detector making a which-path measurement in an atom interferometer. We discuss the MWI claim that, while both measurement outcomes occur in each experimental iteration, an observer will experience only one outcome or the other, with a probability consistent with experiment. Finally, we discuss how MWI does not have action at a distance. This article is written to be accessible to anyone with an undergraduate course in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Existing protocols for classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) consume the prover's witness state, requiring a new witness state for each invocation. Because QMA witnesses are not generally clonable, destroying the input witness means that amplifying soundness and completeness via repetition requires many copies of the witness. Building CVQC with low soundness error that uses only *one* copy of the witness has remained an open problem so far.
  We resolve this problem by constructing a CVQC that uses a single copy of the QMA witness, has negligible completeness and soundness errors, and does *not* destroy its witness. The soundness of our CVQC is based on the post-quantum Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption.
  To obtain this result, we define and construct two primitives (under the post-quantum LWE assumption) for non-destructively handling superpositions of classical data, which we believe are of independent interest:
  - A *state preserving* classical argument for NP.
  - Dual-mode trapdoor functions with *state recovery*.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and hybrid quantum-classical extensions provide a promising framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into the learning process. In this work, we study embedding strategies for trainable embedding quantum physics-informed neural networks (TE-QPINNs) in the context of nonlinear reaction-diffusion (RD) systems. We introduce an extended TE-QPINN (x-TE-QPINN) architecture that supports both classical and fully quantum embeddings, enabling a controlled comparison between feedforward neural network-based feature maps and parameterized quantum circuit embeddings. The first architecture is the classical embedding feed-forward neural network-based TE-QPINN (FNN-TE-QPINN), while the latter variant is a purely quantum one, referred to as quantum embedding neural network-based TE-QPINN (QNN-TE-QPINN). The proposed framework employs hardware-efficient variational quantum circuits and species-specific readout operators to approximate coupled multi-field dynamics while enforcing governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions through a physics-informed loss function. By isolating the embedding mechanism while keeping the variational ansatz, loss formulation, and optimization procedure fixed, we analyze the impact of embedding design on gradient structure, parameter scaling, and quantum resource requirements. Numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional RD equations demonstrate that quantum embeddings can replace classical embeddings without degradation in solution accuracy and, in certain regimes, exhibit improved optimization behavior compared to classical PINNs and hybrid quantum models with fixed embeddings. These results provide architectural insight into hybrid quantum PDE solvers and inform the design of resource-efficient quantum physics-informed learning methods.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the design of the checkpointing and restoration for quantum HPC that leverages dynamic circuit technology to enable restartable and resilient quantum execution. Rather than attempting to checkpoint quantum states, our approach redefines checkpointing as a control flow and algorithmic state problem. By exploiting mid-circuit measurements, classical feed forward, and conditional execution supported by dynamic circuits, we capture sufficient program state to allow correct restoration of quantum workflows after interruption or failure. This design aligns naturally with iterative and staged quantum algorithms such as variational eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization, and time-stepping methods commonly used in quantum simulation and scientific computing.

Abstract: The spin-dynamics of two alkali atoms in an optical tweezer is driven by spin-changing collisions that couple the spin-state of the atoms to their relative motion. This paper experimentally studies the resulting spin-states when the relative motion is in a thermal state with k B T much larger than the energies of the spin-states that take part in the dynamics. We find that an initially unentangled spin-state can evolve into an entangled state. This is contrary to the common case when coupling a quantum system to hot degrees of freedom leads to loss of entanglement and not its generation. Moreover, we show that the generated entanglement is technologically useful as it, in principle, can enhance the sensitivity of measurements beyond the standard quantum limit. This may provide a promising avenue for robust entanglement generation for future technologies.

Abstract: We show that the quantum Fisher information about any phase parameter encoded in a family of pure quantum states can be faithfully compressed into a single qubit, accompanied by a logarithmic amount of classical bits. When the phase is encoded into many identical copies of a qubit state on the equator of the Bloch sphere, we show that the compression can be implemented sequentially, by iteratively compressing pairs of qubits into a single qubit. We experimentally demonstrate this building block in a photonic setup, developing two alternative compression strategies, based on Type-I fusion gate and a postselected implementation of the CNOT gate.

Abstract: Discovering configurations that are both high-utility and structurally diverse under expensive black-box evaluation and strict query budgets remains a central challenge in data-driven discovery. Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery.

Abstract: We show an unconditional classical oracle separation between the class of languages that can be verified using a quantum proof ($\mathsf{QMA}$) and the class of languages that can be verified with a classical proof ($\mathsf{QCMA}$). Compared to the recent work of Bostanci, Haferkamp, Nirkhe, and Zhandry (STOC 2026), our proof is conceptually and technically simpler, and readily extends to other oracle separations. In particular, our techniques yield the first unconditional classical oracle separation between the class of languages that can be decided with quantum advice ($\mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{qpoly}$) and the class of languages that can be decided with classical advice ($\mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{poly}$), improving on the quantum oracle separation of Aaronson and Kuperberg (CCC 2007) and the classically-accessible classical oracle separation of Li, Liu, Pelecanos and Yamakawa (ITCS 2024).
  Our oracles are based on the code intersection problem introduced by Yamakawa and Zhandry (FOCS 2022), combined with codes that have extremely good list-recovery properties.

Abstract: Implementation of quantum logic gates with linear optical elements plays a prominent role in quantum computing due to the relatively easier manipulation and realization. We present efficient schemes to implement controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate by solely using linear optics. We encode the control qubits and target qudits in photonic polarization (two-level) and spatial degrees of freedom ($d$-level), respectively. Based on the hybrid encoding, CNOT and Fredkin gates are constructed in a deterministic way without any borrowed ancillary photons or measurement-induced nonlinearities. Remarkably, the number of linear optics required to implement a CNOT gate has been reduced to one polarization beam splitter (PBS), while only $d$ PBSs are necessary to implement a generalized Fredkin gate. The optical depths of all schemes are reduced to one and dimension-independent. Besides, the fidelity of our three-qubit Fredkin gate is higher than 99.7\% under realistic conditions, which is higher than the previous schemes.

Abstract: We study the following task: Alice is given a classical description of a rank-$k$ projector $P$ on $\mathbb{C}^d$, and Alice and Bob want to prepare the quantum state $P/k$ on Bob's side using shared entanglement and classical communication. The general form of this task is known as remote state preparation (RSP). We give nearly-matching lower and upper bounds for the entanglement cost and communication cost for RSP of the states $P/k$. Ours are the first nearly matching upper and lower bounds for RSP of mixed states, and in the special case of pure states, our lower bound outperforms the best previously known lower bound. Our results show that any pure entangled state that can be used to do RSP of these states with $o(d)$ bits of communication, can distill $\log d$ ebits of entanglement, and conversely, any state that can distill $\log d$ ebits of entanglement can be used to do RSP of these states efficiently. As applications of our results, we rederive a previously-known incompressibility result for states of the form $P/k$, and give a new entanglement-assisted communication protocol for the equality function that uses $\frac{1}{2}\log n + O(1)$ many ebits, and $O(1)$ communication.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum advantage in quantum illumination using two-qubit mixed states as the initial resource. We show that in quantum illumination, the achievable advantage is determined by an interplay between initial entanglement and discord. First, we rigorously show that the quantum advantage for a given state equals the amount of discord consumed for illumination. Subsequently, we find that states with identical initial discord can lead to varying advantages, indicating that the usable portion of discord for illumination depends on additional structural features of the state. Then, we consider the relation between the advantage and both entanglement and discord by performing a conditional extremal analysis. To this end, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial discord, we compute the maximum and minimum initial entanglement within each cluster. We demonstrate that, for states with fixed initial discord, the maximum (and not minimum) entanglement increases by increment of the advantage. We conclude that for any given initial discord, higher entanglement is a sufficient (but not necessary) resource for higher advantage. On the other hand, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial entanglement, we compute the maximum and minimum initial discord in each group. Here, the minimum (and not always maximum) discord scales monotonically with advantage. It shows that, for fixed initial entanglement, higher discord is a necessary (but not always sufficient) resource for higher advantage. This result provides a refined, operational perspective on how different forms of quantum correlations govern the performance of the illumination protocol. We finally find a persistent linear dependence of the advantage on initial discord in the high-noise regime, highlighting discord as the key resource for resilience to noise in the protocol.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A major challenge in photonic quantum technologies is developing strategies to prepare suitable discrete-variable quantum states using simple input states, linear optics, and auxiliary photon measurements to identify successful outcomes. Fundamentally, this challenge arises from the lack of strong non-linearities on the single-photon level, meaning that photonic state preparation based on linear optics cannot benefit from the deterministic gate-based approach available to other physical platforms. Instead, the preparation of quantum states can be probabilistically implemented using single photons, linear-optical networks, and photon detection. However, determining whether an input state can be transformed into a target state using a specific measurement pattern - a problem that can be mapped to deciding the feasibility of a system of polynomial equations - is a complex problem in general. To solve it, we apply the Nullstellensatz Linear Algebra algorithm from algebraic geometry to quantum state generation; this can provide definitive no-go results by proving infeasibility when the state preparation task in question has no solution. We demonstrate this capability to validate and establish lower bounds on the physical resource requirements for the realization of several ubiquitous optical states and gates.

Abstract: Quantum repeater networks distribute entanglement over long distances but must balance fidelity, delay, and resource contention. Prior work optimized throughput and end-to-end fidelity, yet little attention has been paid to the freshness of entanglement-the time since a usable Bell pair was last delivered. We introduce the Fidelity-Age (FA) metric, which measures this interval for states whose fidelity exceeds a threshold Fmin. A renewal formulation links slot-level success probability to long-run average FA, enabling a stochastic control problem that minimizes FA under budget and memory limits. Two lightweight schedulers, FA-THR and FA-INDEX, approximate Lyapunov-drift-optimal control. Simulations on slotted repeater grids show that FA-aware scheduling preserves throughput while reducing extreme-age events by up to two orders of magnitude. Fidelity-Age thus provides a tractable, physically grounded metric for reliable and timely entanglement delivery in quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum simulation of the linear non-unitary dynamics is crucial in scientific computing. In this work, we establish a generic framework, referred to as the Amplitude-Phase Separation (APS) methods, which formulates any non-unitary evolution into separate simulation of a unitary operator and a Hermitian operator, thus allow one to take best advantage of, and to even improve existing algorithms, developed for unitary or Hermitian evolution respectively. We utilize two techniques: the first achieves a provably optimal query complexity via a shifted Dyson series; the second breaks the conventional linear dependency, achieving fast-forwarding by exhibiting a square-root dependence on the norm of the dissipative part. Furthermore, one can derive existing methods such as the LCHS (Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation) and the NDME (Non-Diagonal Density Matrix Encoding) methods from APS. The APS provides an effective and generic pathway for developing efficient quantum algorithms for general non-unitary dynamics to achieve either optimal query complexity or fast-forwarding property, outperforming the existing algorithms for the same problems.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) is a key application of the quantum internet. We report the realization of DI-QKD between two single-atom nodes linked by 100-km fibers. To improve the entangling rate, single-photon interference is leveraged for entanglement heralding, and quantum frequency conversion is used to reduce fiber loss. A tailored Rydberg-based emission scheme suppresses the photon recoil effect on the atom without introducing noise. We achieved high-fidelity atom-atom entanglement and positive asymptotic key rates for fiber lengths up to 100 km. At 11 km, 1.2 million heralded Bell pairs were prepared over 624 hours, yielding an estimated extractable finite-size secure key rate of 0.112 bits per event against general attacks. Our results close the gap between proof-of-principle quantum network experiments and real-world applications.

Abstract: In this work, we study Bayesian quantum parameter estimation given a finite number of uses of the process encoding one or more unknown physical quantities. For multiple uses, it is conventional to classify quantum metrological protocols as parallel, sequential, or indefinite causal order. Within each class, the central question is to determine the optimal strategy -- namely, the choice of optimal input state, control operations, measurement, and estimator(s) -- to perform the estimation task. Using the formalism of higher-order operations, we develop an algorithm that looks for the optimal solution, and we provide an efficient numerical implementation based on semidefinite programming. Our benchmark examples, specifically those against existing analytical solutions, demonstrate how powerful and precise our method is. We further explore the potential of greedy adaptive strategies, which are based on classical feedforward to design the optimal protocol for the next round. Using this framework, we compare the optimal achievable Bayesian score across classes. We demonstrate the strength of our algorithm in several examples, from single to multiparameter estimation and with various prior distributions. Particularly, we find examples in which there is a strict hierarchy between different classes. Nonetheless, the performance of the different quantum memory-assisted classes are not significantly different, while they may significantly outperform the adaptive greedy strategy.

Abstract: Solving large-scale linear systems problems is a central task in scientific and industrial computing. Classical iterative solvers face increasing difficulty as the number of unknowns becomes large, while fully quantum linear solvers require fault-tolerant resources that remain far beyond near-term feasibility. Here we propose a quantum-accelerated conjugate gradient (QACG) framework in which a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm is used exclusively to construct a spectrally informed initial guess for a classical conjugate gradient (CG) solver. Rather than replacing classical kernels, the quantum subroutine functions as a cooperative accelerator that selectively suppresses low-energy spectral components responsible for slow classical convergence. We analyze the total runtime and resource requirements of this integrated quantum-HPC platform for the 3D Poisson equation. A central feature of QACG is a controllable decomposition of the condition number between the quantum and the classical solver, enabling flexible allocation of computational effort across quantum and classical resources. Under explicit architectural assumptions, we identify regimes in which this cooperative strategy yields a runtime advantage over purely classical approaches while requiring substantially fewer quantum resources than end-to-end quantum linear solvers. These results illustrate a concrete pathway toward the scientific and industrial use of early-stage fault-tolerant quantum computing and point to a scalable hybrid paradigm in which quantum devices act as accelerators within high-performance computing workflows rather than as standalone replacements.

Abstract: Direct fidelity estimation (DFE) is a famous tool for estimating the fidelity with a target pure state. However, such a method generally requires exponentially many sampling copies due to the large magic of the target state. This work proposes a sample- and gate-efficient fidelity estimation algorithm that is affordable within feasible quantum devices. We show that the fidelity estimation with pure states close to the structure of phase states, for which sample-efficient DFE is limited by their strong entanglement and magic, can be done by using $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ sampling copies, with a single $n$-qubit fan-out gate. As the target state becomes a phase state, the sampling complexity reaches $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Such a drastic improvement stems from a crucial step in our scheme, the so-called phase stripping, which can significantly reduce the target-state magic. Furthermore, we convert a complex diagonal gate resource, which is needed to design a phase-stripping-adapted algorithm, into nonlinear classical post-processing of Pauli measurements so that we only require a single fan-out gate. Additionally, as another variant using the nonlinear post-processing, we propose a nonlinear extension of the conventional DFE scheme. Here, the sampling reduction compared to DFE is also guaranteed, while preserving the Pauli measurement as the only circuit resource. We expect our work to contribute to establishing noise-resilient quantum algorithms by enabling a significant reduction in sampling overhead for fidelity estimation under the restricted gate resources, and ultimately to clarifying a fundamental gap between the resource overhead required to understand complex physical properties and that required to generate them.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML), as an interdisciplinary field bridging quantum computing and machine learning, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Currently, the field as a whole faces challenges due to incomplete theoretical foundations for the expressivity of quantum neural networks (QNNs). In this paper we propose a constructive QNN model and demonstrate that it possesses the universal approximation property (UAP), which means it can approximate any square-integrable function up to arbitrary accuracy. Furthermore, it supports switching function bases, thus adaptable to various scenarios in numerical approximation and machine learning. Our model has asymptotic advantages over the best classical feed-forward neural networks in terms of circuit size and achieves optimal parameter complexity when approximating Sobolev functions under $L_2$ norm.

Abstract: The reliable characterization of quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum information science. For this purpose, quantum state tomography provides a standard framework for reconstructing quantum states from measurement data, yet it is often degraded by experimental noise. Mitigating such noise is therefore essential for the accurate estimation of the states in realistic settings. In this work, we propose a scalable tomography method based on multilayer perceptron networks that mitigate unknown noise through supervised learning. This approach is data-driven and thus does not rely on explicit assumptions about the noise model or measurement, making it readily extendable to general quantum systems. Numerical simulations, ranging from special pure states to random mixed states, demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates noise across a broad range of scenarios, compared with the case without mitigation.

Abstract: While quantum algorithms for solving large scale systems of linear equations offer potential speedups, their application has largely been confined to sparse matrices. This work extends the scope of these algorithms to a broad class of structured dense matrices arise in potential theory, covariance modeling, and computational physics, namely, hierarchically block separable (HBS) matrices. We develop two distinct methods to make these systems amenable to quantum solvers. The first is a pre-processing approach that transforms the dense matrix into a larger but sparse format. The second is a direct block encoding scheme that recursively constructs the necessary oracles from the HBS structure. We provide a detailed complexity analysis and rigorous error bounds for both methods. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of our approaches.

Abstract: To build large-scale quantum computers while minimizing resource requirements, one may want to use high-rate quantum error-correcting codes that can efficiently encode information. However, realizing an addressable gate$\unicode{x2014}$a logical gate on a subset of logical qubits within a high-rate code$\unicode{x2014}$in a fault-tolerant manner can be challenging and may require ancilla qubits. Transversal and fold-transversal gates could provide a means to fault-tolerantly implement logical gates using a constant-depth circuit without ancilla qubits, but available gates of these types could be limited depending on the code and might not be addressable. In this work, we study a family of $[\![n=2^m,k={m \choose m/2}\approx n/\sqrt{π\log_2(n)/2},d=2^{m/2}=\sqrt{n}]\!]$ self-dual quantum Reed$\unicode{x2013}$Muller codes, where $m$ is a positive even number. For any code in this family, we construct a generating set of the full logical Clifford group comprising only transversal and fold-transversal gates, thus enabling the implementation of any addressable Clifford gate. To our knowledge, this is the first known construction of the full logical Clifford group for a family of codes in which $k$ grows near-linearly in $n$ up to a $1/\sqrt{\log n}$ factor that uses only transversal and fold-transversal gates without requiring ancilla qubits.

Abstract: We investigate the structure of $k$-positivity and Schmidt numbers for classes of linear maps and bipartite quantum states exhibiting symplectic group symmetry. Specifically, we consider (1) linear maps on $M_d(\mathbb{C})$ which are covariant under conjugation by unitary symplectic matrices $S$, and (2) $d\otimes d$ bipartite states which are invariant under $S\otimes S$ or $S\otimes \overline{S}$ actions, each parametrized by two real variables. We provide a complete characterization of all $k$-positivity and decomposability conditions for these maps and explicitly compute the Schmidt numbers for the corresponding bipartite states. In particular, our analysis yields a broad class of PPT states with Schmidt number $d/2$ and the first explicit constructions of (optimal) $k$-positive indecomposable linear maps for arbitrary $k=1,\ldots, d/2-1$, achieving the best-known bounds. Overall, our results offer a natural and analytically tractable framework in which both strong forms of positive indecomposability and high degrees of PPT entanglement can be studied systematically.
  We present two further applications of symplectic group symmetry. First, we show that the PPT-squared conjecture holds within the class of PPT linear maps that are either symplectic-covariant or conjugate-symplectic-covariant. Second, we resolve a conjecture of Pal and Vertesi concerning the optimal lower bound of the Sindici-Piani semidefinite program for PPT entanglement.

Abstract: We present a finite schematic axiomatisation of quantum circuits over d-level systems (qudits), uniform in every finite dimension d >= 2. For each d we define a PROP equipped with a family of control functors, treating control as a primitive categorical constructor. Using a translation between qudit circuits and the LOPP calculus for linear optics based on d-ary Gray codes, we obtain for each d a finite set of local axiom schemata that is sound and complete for unitary d-level circuits: two circuits denote the same unitary if and only if they are inter-derivable using axioms involving at most three wires. The generators are compatible with standard universal qudit gate families, yielding a sound equational basis for circuit rewriting and optimisation-by-rewriting. Conceptually, this extends the qubit circuit completeness results of Clément et al.\ to arbitrary finite dimension, and instantiates the control-as-constructor approach of Delorme and Perdrix in this setting, while keeping the axiom shapes uniform in d.

Abstract: Equational reasoning is central to quantum circuit optimisation and verification: one replaces subcircuits by provably equivalent ones using a fixed set of rewrite rules viewed as equations. We study such reasoning through finite equational theories, presenting restricted quantum gate fragments as symmetric monoidal categories (PROPs), where wire permutations are treated as structural and separated cleanly from fragment-specific gate axioms. For six widely used near-Clifford fragments: qubit Clifford, real Clifford, Clifford+T (up to two qubits), Clifford+CS (up to three qubits) and CNOT-dihedral, we transfer the completeness results of prior work into our PROP framework. Beyond completeness, we address minimality (axiom independence). Using uniform separating interpretations into simple semantic targets, we prove minimality for several fragments (including all arities for qubit Clifford, real Clifford, and CNOT-dihedral), and bounded minimality for the remaining cases. Overall, our presentations significantly reduce rule counts compared to prior work and provide a reusable categorical framework for constructing complete and often minimal rewrite systems for quantum circuit fragments.

Abstract: Adiabatic chiral state conversion (CSC) is one of the many counterintuitive effects associated with non-Hermitian physics. In quantum systems, numerous works have demonstrated this phenomenon under both non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindblad evolution. However, despite considerable progress, the physical mechanism behind it has been a subject of debate. In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a quantum generalization of the multinomial distribution for the transition probabilities of $m$ identical photons in a $k$-port linear optical interferometer: two multinomial coefficients (one for the input configuration, one for the output) times the squared modulus of a coherent sum over routing matrices, weighted by the multivariate hypergeometric distribution; no Hilbert space formalism is needed to state or evaluate it. The classical multinomial is recovered when all photons enter through a single port, the coherent sum degenerating to a single term with no interference; the quantum family is not a generalization in the Askey sense but a parallel family that departs from classical statistics through the coherence of the amplitude summation. The $r$-th factorial moment carries a squared multinomial coefficient in place of the classical single one, the extra factor arising from the two copies of the amplitude expansion whose indices the Fock state forces to agree; for the beam splitter, the third cumulant is invariant under bosonic interference and the quantum departure first appears in the fourth cumulant as negative excess kurtosis; for multiport interferometers, however, three-body interference breaks this invariance and the departure enters already at the third cumulant. Cross-mode covariances involve the phases of the scattering matrix through coherence terms that strengthen output anti-correlations beyond the classical value; together with the squared-coefficient signature in the single-mode moments, these provide low-order statistical witnesses for boson sampling verification without requiring the full permanent computation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recent years, the quantum nature of gravity has attracted significant attention as one of the most important problems in modern physics. Here, we analyze the mechanism of gravitationally-induced entanglement from the perspective of quantum resource theory. Building on the framework of Bose et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 240401 (2017)], we show that the gravitational interaction acts as a unitary channel, redistributing quantum resources between two spatially superposed masses. Specifically, we demonstrate that the resulting bipartite entanglement originates from the coherent conversion of local quantum coherence -- initially present in each subsystem -- into shared non-local correlations. We derive exact, analytical complementarity relations quantifying this conversion, link the decay of local coherence directly to the growth of entanglement, and support these findings with numerical simulations. Our results clarify the underlying mechanism and establish gravity as a coherence-to-entanglement conversion channel, offering a refined interpretive basis for forthcoming experimental tests. Crucially, we show that initial coherence is a necessary condition for entanglement generation and that its degree bounds the maximum achievable entanglement, with maximal entanglement requiring initial maximal coherence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) provides a geometric representation, within the Bloch picture, of all possible states to which one qubit can be steered through measurements performed on another correlated qubit. However, in most realistic settings, quantum systems are inevitably coupled to their surrounding environment, resulting in decoherence and the consequent degradation of the QSE. Here, by investigating how local dissipative environments coupled separately to each qubit affect the steering properties geometrized by the QSE within an exact non-Markovian framework, we find that the geometry of each party's QSE is closely tied to whether a bound state forms in the energy spectrum of the total qubit-environment system. We systematically examine the characteristics of QSEs under three distinct scenarios: two-sided bound states, one-sided bound states, and no bound state, revealing a diverse range of steering types. Our work establishes quantum reservoir engineering as a tunable strategy for protecting and controlling quantum steering in open systems, offering a practical pathway toward robust steering-based quantum technologies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The dissipative phase transitions in the open transverse and longitudinal Dicke-Ising model (DIM), which incorporates nearest-neighbor Ising-type spin interactions into the Dicke framework, are investigated within a mean-field approach and further validated by detailed stability analysis. While the dissipative phase diagram of the transverse DIM is only slightly shifted upward compared with its ground-state counterpart, dissipation in the longitudinal DIM stabilizes bistable nonequilibrium steady states and induces first-order phase transitions that are absent in the ground-state phase diagram. This bistable phase is characterized by the coexistence of superradiant and antiferromagnetic orders, and it converts a ground-state triple point into a tetracritical point, at which the boundaries of the first- and second-order transitions intersect. Our results reveal that the interplay among spin interactions, light-matter coupling, and dissipation supports a diverse set of nonequilibrium phase transitions and provides broad tunability of the phase diagram. These findings offer a theoretical foundation for exploring nonequilibrium physics in realistic open solid-state quantum systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic reconstruction of quantum dynamics based on inference over action space. The fundamental object is a density of action states encoding the multiplicity of dynamical alternatives between configurations. Maximum-entropy inference introduces a finite resolution scale in action, implying that sufficiently close action contributions are operationally indistinguishable. We show that this indistinguishability, together with probability normalization and action additivity, selects complex amplitudes and unitary evolution as the minimal continuous representation compatible with action additivity, probability normalization, and inference under finite resolution. Quantum interference and unitarity therefore emerge as consequences of these assumptions rather than independent postulates. From the resulting propagator, the Lagrangian, Hilbert-space structure, and Schrödinger equation follow as derived consequences. In the infinitesimal-time limit, action differences universally fall below the resolution scale, making coherent summation the minimal consistent description at every step. The numerical value of the action scale is fixed empirically and identified with $\hbar$.

Abstract: We propose a robust platform for simulating chiral quantum magnetism using linear arrays of trapped asymmetric top molecules, specifically 1,2-propanediol ($\mathrm{C_{3}H_{8}O_{2}}$). By mapping the Stark-dressed rotational states onto an effective spin-$1/2$ subspace, we rigorously derive a generalized $XXZ$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian governing the underlying many-body dynamics. Unlike standard solid-state models where the topological Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) is introduced phenomenologically, we demonstrate that DMI emerges \textit{ab initio} from the molecular stereochemistry. Specifically, the interference between the transition dipole moments of heterochiral enantiomer pairs (L-R), which breaks inversion symmetry, generates a tunable DMI that stabilizes a Chiral Luttinger Liquid phase. Through a comprehensive phase-diagram analysis, we identify an optimal experimental regime characterized by intermolecular separations of \( r \approx 1.5~\mathrm{nm} \) and intermediate electric-field strengths \( d\varepsilon/B \approx 2.5 \). In this window, the system is protected from trivial field-polarized phases and exhibits a robust gapless spin-spiral texture. Our results establish 1,2-propanediol arrays as a versatile quantum simulator, providing a direct microscopic link between molecular chirality and topological many-body phases.

Abstract: Recent developments in the field of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have shifted the prerequisites for trainability for many barren plateau-free models onto the data encoding state fed into a classically trainable unitary. By strengthening proofs relating to small-angle initialisation, we provide a full circuit model which does not suffer from barren plateaus and is robust against current classical simulation techniques, specifically tensor network contraction and Pauli propagation. We propose this as a quantum generative model amenable towards NISQ devices and quantum-classical hybrid models, raising new questions in the debate regarding usefulness of VQCs.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法可用于非线性反问题中的非参数拟合优度检验，且在适当条件下能实现一致的后验收缩和有效的假设检验。

Abstract: This work is concerned with nonparametric goodness-of-fit testing in the context of nonlinear inverse problems with random observations. Bayesian posterior distributions based upon a Gaussian process prior distribution are proven to contract at a certain rate uniformly over a set of true parameters. The corresponding posterior mean is shown to converge uniformly at the posterior contraction rate in the sense of satisfying a concentration inequality. Distinguishability for bounded alternatives separated from a composite null hypothesis at the posterior contraction rate is established using infimum plug-in tests based on the posterior mean and also on maximum a posteriori estimators. The results are applied to a class of inverse problems governed by ordinary differential equation initial value problems that is widely used in pharmacokinetics. For this class, uniform posterior contraction rates are proven and then used to establish distinguishability.

Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation from a generalized linear model with a random design matrix that is orthogonally invariant in law. Such a model allows the design have an arbitrary distribution of singular values and only assumes that its singular vectors are generic. It is a vast generalization of the i.i.d. Gaussian design typically considered in the theoretical literature, and is motivated by the fact that real data often have a complex correlation structure so that methods relying on i.i.d. assumptions can be highly suboptimal. Building on the paradigm of spectrally-initialized iterative optimization, this paper proposes optimal spectral estimators and combines them with an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, establishing rigorous performance guarantees for these two algorithmic steps. Both the spectral initialization and the subsequent AMP meet existing conjectures on the fundamental limits to estimation -- the former on the optimal sample complexity for efficient weak recovery, and the latter on the optimal errors. Numerical experiments suggest the effectiveness of our methods and accuracy of our theory beyond orthogonally invariant data.

Abstract: Geometric quantiles are popular location functionals to build rank-based statistical procedures in multivariate settings. They are obtained through the minimization of a non-smooth convex objective function. As a result, the singularity of the directional derivatives leads to numerical instabilities and poor sample properties as well as surprising `phase transitions' from empirical to population distributions. To solve these issues, we introduce a regularized version of geometric distribution functions and quantiles that are provably close to the usual geometric concepts and share their qualitative properties, both in the empirical and continuous case, while allowing for a much broader applicability of asymptotic results without any moment condition. We also show that any linear assignment of probability measures (such as the univariate distribution function), that is also translation- and orthogonal-equivariant, necessarily coincides with one of our regularized geometric distribution functions.

Abstract: We study discrete-time, discrete-state multistate Markov models from the perspective of algebraic statistics. These models are widely studied in event history analysis, and are characterized by the state space, the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. A finite path under the multistate Markov model is a particular set of states occupied at finite time instances $\{1, \dots, n\}$. The main goal of this paper is to establish a bridge between event history analysis and algebraic statistics. The joint probabilities of finite paths in these models have a natural monomial parametrization in terms of the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. We study the polynomial relations among joint path probabilities. When the statistical constraints on the parameters are disregarded, nonhomogeneous multistate Markov models of arbitrary order can be viewed as slices of decomposable hierarchical models. This yields a complete description of their vanishing ideals as toric ideals generated by explicit families of binomials. Moreover, the variety of this vanishing ideal equals the nonhomogeneous multistate Markov model on the probability simplex. In contrast, homogeneous multistate Markov models exhibit different algebraic behavior, as time homogeneity imposes additional polynomial relations, leading to vanishing ideals that are strictly larger than in the nonhomogeneous case. We also derive families of binomial relations that vanish on homogeneous multistate Markov models. We investigate maximum likelihood estimation from statistical and algebraic perspectives. For nonhomogeneous models, classical and algebraic formulas agree; in the homogeneous case, the algebraic approach is more complex. Lastly, we provide data applications where we demonstrate the statistical theory to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters under specific multistate Markov models.

Abstract: The Gaussian kernel is one of the most important kernels, applicable to many research fields, including scientific computing and data science. In this paper, we present asymptotic analysis of the Gaussian kernel matrix in high dimension under a statistical model of noisy data. The main result is a nice combination of Karoui's asymptotic analysis with procedures of constrained low rank matrix approximations. More specifically, Karouli clarified an important asymptotic structure of the Gaussian kernel matrix, leading to strong consistency of the eigenvectors, though the eigenvalues are inconsistent. This paper focuses on the above results and presents a consistent estimator with the use of the smallest eigenvalue, whenever the target kernel matrix tends to low rank in the asymptotic regime. Importantly, asymptotic analysis is given under a statistical model representing partial noise. Although a naive estimator is inconsistent, applying an optimization method for low rank approximations with constraints, we overcome the difficulty caused by the inconsistency, resulting in a new estimator with strong consistency in rank deficient cases.

Abstract: The broken random sample problem was first introduced by DeGroot, Feder, and Gole (1971, Ann. Math. Statist.): in each observation (batch), a random sample of $M$ i.i.d. point pairs $ ((X_i,Y_i))_{i=1}^M$ is drawn from a joint distribution with density $p(x,y)$, but we can observe only the unordered multisets $(X_i)_{i=1}^M$ and $(Y_i)_{i=1}^M$ separately; that is, the pairing information is lost. For large $M$, inferring $p$ from a single observation has been shown to be essentially impossible. In this paper, we propose a parametric method based on a pseudo-log-likelihood to estimate $p$ from $N$ i.i.d. broken sample batches, and we prove a fast convergence rate in $N$ for our estimator that is uniform in $M$, under mild assumptions.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-index models (MIMs), where the label depends on the input $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ only through an unknown $\mathsf{s}$-dimensional projection $\boldsymbol{W}_*^\mathsf{T} \boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\mathsf{s}$. Exploiting the equivariance of this problem under the orthogonal group $\mathcal{O}_d$, we obtain a sharp harmonic-analytic characterization of the learning complexity for MIMs with spherically symmetric inputs -- which refines and generalizes previous Gaussian-specific analyses. Specifically, we derive statistical and computational complexity lower bounds within the Statistical Query (SQ) and Low-Degree Polynomial (LDP) frameworks. These bounds decompose naturally across spherical harmonic subspaces. Guided by this decomposition, we construct a family of spectral algorithms based on harmonic tensor unfolding that sequentially recover the latent directions and (nearly) achieve these SQ and LDP lower bounds. Depending on the choice of harmonic degree sequence, these estimators can realize a broad range of trade-offs between sample and runtime complexity. From a technical standpoint, our results build on the semisimple decomposition of the $\mathcal{O}_d$-action on $L^2 (\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ and the intertwining isomorphism between spherical harmonics and traceless symmetric tensors.

Abstract: This paper considers the asymptotic behavior in $β$-Hölder spaces, and under $L^p$ loss, of the gamma kernel density estimator introduced by Chen [Ann. Inst. Statist. Math. 52 (2000), 471-480] for the analysis of nonnegative data, when the target's support is assumed to be upper bounded. It is shown that this estimator can achieve the minimax rate asymptotically for a suitable choice of bandwidth whenever $(p,β)\in [1,3)\times(0,2]$ or $(p,β)\in [3,4)\times ((p-3)/(p-2),2]$. It is also shown that this estimator cannot be minimax when either $p\in [4,\infty)$ or $β\in (2,\infty)$.

Abstract: The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct an array of spin singlet and/or triplet qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings describe a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits and therefore provide a platform for performing many-body quantum simulations on spin excitations like magnons and triplons.

Result: 发现增强电子-声子耦合会引发一级相变，导致陈绝缘体突然转变为具有扩展电荷序参量的交错电荷密度波；同时观察到布特指数和局域陈标记崩溃、能隙闭合以及边界谱权重消失；尽管存在由时间反演对称性破缺引起的相位问题，但在低频区域仍较轻微且平均相位因子能清晰追踪相界。

Conclusion: 电子-声子耦合可触发陈拓扑的不连续崩塌，为理解相关拓扑平台中的退拓扑机制提供了明确路径，并给出了可用于实验探测的关键特征。

Abstract: We study the half-filled Haldane-Holstein model, where a paradigmatic Chern insulator is coupled to fully dynamical phonons, and provide an unbiased characterization of how retarded electron-phonon interactions destabilize Chern topology. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms.

Abstract: Interaction effects are dramatically enhanced in flat-band systems due to quenched kinetics, facilitating the binding of single excitations into composite quasiparticles. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of spin polarons over the entire momentum and energy space within the Mielke-Tasaki model using projected exact diagonalization. We identify distinct low-energy spin polarons at momenta q=0 and q=π, and also find multiple high-energy branches of spin polaron. It is demonstrated that the interaction-induced Hartree dispersion plays a decisive role in determining the momentum sector of low-energy spin polarons. Furthermore, by introducing a finite bandwidth, we unravel the underlying binding mechanisms: the formation of low-energy spin polarons is governed by the conventional virtual exchange mechanism, whereas the high-energy spin polarons arise from a joint effect of the effective attraction and virtual exchange. Our results suggest promising avenues for realizing spin polaron crystals and exploring novel superconducting pairing mechanisms in moiré materials like twisted WSe2 and MoTe2.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids, a highly topologically entangled, dynamically correlated state where quantum fluctuations preclude any long-range ordering down to absolute zero. In the search for a topologically robust qubit, the scientific community has been in continuous hunt for real quantum spin liquid systems. Alexei Kitaev in his exactly solvable model for a spin-1/2 two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, presented a system that hosts a topologically protected state (Majorana zero-modes). Under an applied external field, the Kitaev spin liquids turn into a topologically non-trivial chiral spin-liquid state with non-abelian anionic excitations, which is crucial for quantum computing. Earlier theoretical predictions advocated that Kitaev physics can be realized in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators such as honeycomb irradiates and ruthenates. However, the experimental findings continuously challenge the theoretical aspects, indicating the presence of non-Kitaev interactions in real materials, where the dimensionality, disorder (vacancy), chemical composition, generalized spin-S, and external perturbations (pressure, magnetic field, temperature) can actively tune the Kitaev interactions and the ground state excitations. In this review article, a comprehensive discussion is included with an updated literature survey in the context of the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a probe for Kitaev quantum spin liquids.

Abstract: The Weyl exceptional nodal lines usually occur in 3D topological semimetals, but also emerge in the parameter space of 1D systems. In this work, we study the impact of dissipation on the nodal ring in a 3D topological semimetal. We find that the energy spectrum becomes fully complex in the presence of dissipation, and the original nodal ring is split into two exceptional rings. We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings. We also propose a 1D model that has the same topological feature in the parameter space. It provides a simple way to measure the topological invariant in a low-dimensional system. Numerical simulations indicate that the topological invariant is robust under the random perturbations of the system parameters.

Motivation: 研究Hf取代对铀氢化物中亚稳相α-UH3的稳定性及其物理性质的影响，以实现对该相的系统表征。

Conclusion: Hf取代能有效稳定α-UH3相并调控其电子结构和磁性，揭示了铁磁不均匀性和强无序对低温物性的关键影响。

Abstract: Hf substitution stabilizes the metastable body-centered cubic (bcc) $α$-UH$3$ phase in uranium hydrides, enabling systematic measurements of its magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties. (UH$3$)${1-x}$Hf$x$ hydrides ($x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.30, 0.40$) were obtained by hydrogenation of U${1-x}$Hf$x$ precursor alloys. Powder X-ray diffraction shows a progressive suppression of $β$-UH$3$ phase with increasing $x$, with $α$-UH$3$ domination at $x = 0.30$ and $β$-UH$3$ nearly fully suppressed at $x = 0.40$. Magnetization measurements show ferromagnetic behavior for all compositions with Curie temperatures in the range $T\mathrm{C} \approx 178$--$185$ K and a maximum near $x = 0.15$; however, the spontaneous magnetization is strongly reduced with Hf content, decreasing from $1.0,μ\mathrm{B}$/U in pure $β$-UH$3$ to $0.46,μ\mathrm{B}$/U for (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$. Specific-heat data show a broadened Curie anomaly in the $α$-UH$3$ rich hydride samples, consistent with a distribution of $T\mathrm{C}$ values arising from ferromagnetic inhomogeneities. Specific heat also reveals a monotonic decrease in the Sommerfeld coefficient with increasing Hf concentration, reflecting a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, especially in (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$. The resistivity of (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$ is very large, exhibits a robust negative temperature coefficient over 2--300 K, and shows only weak magnetoresistance, placing transport in a strongly incoherent, disorder-dominated regime.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, we study a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t_\parallel$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model, which has been proposed as an effective low-energy description of LNO. Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\times 8\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms.

Abstract: Topological invariants govern many important physical properties in condensed matter systems. In this work, we obtain the complete set of topological invariants for a family of one-dimensional quasicrystals. The first and best-studied member of the family is the Fibonacci chain, while the successive ones are known in the literature as silver, bronze... and collectively as the metallic mean chains. By considering rational approximants, and by making use of the relationship between these chains and two dimensional Quantum Hall problems, we write down a gap labeling scheme for finite systems, and extend it to the quasiperiodic limit. We show, by numerical computations on open chains, that the proposed scheme correctly yields the winding numbers of edge states in each of the gaps, in all of the quasicrystals. In the strict 1D limit, we discuss properties of a simplified Hofstadter ``butterfly" diagram, with the analogues of Landau levels appearing in the asymptotic limit.

Abstract: Simulating low-temperature properties of three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets is challenging due to the sign problem and the system sizes required to mitigate substantial finite-size effects. However, there are many experimental examples of three-dimensional crystals that could host exotic low-temperature states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations.

Abstract: The distinctive symmetry properties of pure altermagnets make them natural candidates for piezomagnetism. Previous work motivated by the piezomagnetic properties of altermagnets has primarily focused on the spin magnetization response to applied strain. In this paper we study orbital piezomagnetic effects--the orbital magnetization response to applied strain--in minimal lattice models of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions. We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed.

Abstract: In this paper we apply the canonical spin wave theory developed for itinerant Kondo lattice magnets in the strong coupling regime to Kondo ferromagnets, and address two general questions pertaining to their magnetic excitations. First, we compute corrections to the strong coupling (i.e., double-exchange) spin wave dispersion of itinerant ferromagnets. We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction. We show that in the case of the Kane-Mele honeycomb lattice Kondo ferromagnet this leads to topological magnon bands, and discuss the implications of this result for itinerant ferromagnets more broadly.

Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) -- a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials.

Abstract: In recent years, tokenomic systems, decentralized systems that use cryptographic tokens to represent value and rights, have evolved considerably. Growing complexity in incentive structures has expanded the applicability of blockchain beyond purely transactional use. Existing research predominantly examines token economies within specific use cases, proposes conceptual frameworks, or studies isolated aspects such as governance, incentive design, and tokenomics. However, the literature offers limited empirically grounded, end-to-end guidance that integrates these dimensions into a coherent, step-by-step design approach informed by concrete token-economy development efforts. To address this gap, this paper presents the Token Economy Design Method (TEDM), a design-science artifact that synthesizes stepwise design propositions for token-economy design across incentives, governance, and tokenomics. TEDM is derived through an iterative qualitative synthesis of prior contributions and refined through a co-designed case. The artifact is formatively evaluated via the Currynomics case study and additional expert interviews. Currynomics is an ecosystem that maintains the Redcurry stablecoin, using real estate as the underlying asset. TEDM is positioned as reusable design guidance that facilitates the analysis of foundational requirements of tokenized ecosystems. The specificity of the proposed approach lies in the focus on the socio-technical context of the system and early stages of its design.

### [87] [Triggered: A Statistical Analysis of Environmental Influences on Extremist Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09289)
*Christine de Kock,Eduard Hovy*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究通过七年数据，从系统视角分析了极端主义论坛（Stormfront和Incels）与主流社区（r/News）之间的信息互动，发现不同极端群体对外界事件和新闻的反应存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现实事件、媒体报道和跨社区互动如何影响极端主义社区的行为与语言演变。

Method: 结合反事实合成法、向量自回归和格兰杰因果分析，评估事件影响并建模新闻信号、行为结果和语言变化之间的动态关系。

Result: Stormfront和r/News对新闻和暴力事件更敏感，而Incels较少受到外界影响；语言扩散在主流与极端社区间及不同极端意识形态之间存在差异。

Conclusion: 极端主义社区并非同质，它们与周围信息生态系统的耦合程度不同，对外部刺激的反应方式也各异。

Abstract: Online extremist communities operate within a wider information ecosystem shaped by real-world events, news coverage, and cross-community interaction. We adopt a systems perspective to examine these influences using seven years of data from two ideologically distinct extremist forums (Stormfront and Incels) and a mainstream reference community (r/News). We ask three questions: how extremist violence impacts community behaviour; whether news coverage of political entities predicts shifts in conversation dynamics; and whether linguistic diffusion occurs between mainstream and extremist spaces and across extremist ideologies. Methodologically, we combine counterfactual synthesis to estimate event-level impacts with vector autoregression and Granger causality analyses to model ongoing relationships among news signals, behavioural outcomes, and cross-community language change. Across analyses, our results indicate that Stormfront and r/News appear to be more reactive to external stimuli, while Incels demonstrates less cross-community linguistic influence and less responsiveness to news and violent events. These findings underscore that extremist communities are not homogeneous, but differ in how tightly they are coupled to the surrounding information ecosystem.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为UniShare的统一框架，用于联合预测短视频平台上的视频分享和接收者推荐，通过增强表示学习和联合训练范式显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将分享行为解耦为两个独立任务，导致建模孤立和信息利用不足，性能受限。

Method: 提出UniShare框架，结合预训练GNN、多模态嵌入以及双向兴趣与关系匹配，并采用联合训练范式利用双任务信号相互增强。

Result: 在离线实验中显著优于强基线模型，在快手平台的在线A/B测试中，分享次数提升1.95%，接收者回复率提升0.482%。

Conclusion: UniShare通过统一建模和联合训练有效提升了分享预测的性能，兼顾了双边满意度，验证了其在真实场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Sharing behavior on short-video platforms constitutes a complex ternary interaction among the user (sharer), the video (content), and the receiver. Traditional industrial solutions often decouple this into two independent tasks: video recommendation (predicting share probability) and receiver recommendation (predicting whom to share with), leading to suboptimal performance due to isolated modeling and inadequate information utilization. To address this, we propose UniShare, a novel unified framework for joint sharing prediction on both video and receiver recommendation. UniShare models the share probability through an enhanced representation learning module that incorporates pre-trained GNN and multi-modal embeddings, alongside explicit bilateral interest and relationship matching. A key innovation is our joint training paradigm, which leverages signals from both tasks to mutually enhance each other, mitigating data sparsity and improving bilateral satisfaction. We also introduce K-Share, a large-scale real-world dataset constructed from Kuaishou platform logs to support research in this domain. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that UniShare significantly outperforms strong baselines on both tasks. Furthermore, online A/B testing on the Kuaishou platform confirms its effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in key metrics including the number of shares (+1.95%) and receiver reply rate (+0.482%).

TL;DR: 流行度反馈会减少文化多样性并延缓创新，影响选择与创造过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究流行度评分如何影响文化动态中的集体创造力。

Method: 通过一项大规模在线实验，参与者迭代地从不断变化的市场中选择图像并创作自己的修改版本。

Result: 暴露图像的流行度会降低文化多样性，减缓创新速度，延迟美学改进；在选择阶段引发累积优势效应，在创作阶段导致更少颠覆性更改。

Conclusion: 文化市场中的反馈循环不仅影响选择行为，还直接影响文化创新的形式与方向。

Abstract: Real-world creative processes ranging from art to science rely on social feedback-loops between selection and creation. Yet, the effects of popularity feedback on collective creativity remain poorly understood. We investigate how popularity ratings influence cultural dynamics in a large-scale online experiment where participants ($N = 1\,008$) iteratively \textit{select} images from evolving markets and \textit{produce} their own modifications. Results show that exposing the popularity of images reduces cultural diversity and slows innovation, delaying aesthetic improvements. These findings are mediated by alterations of both selection and creation. During selection, popularity information triggers cumulative advantage, with participants preferentially building upon popular images, reducing diversity. During creation, participants make less disruptive changes, and are more likely to expand existing visual patterns. Feedback loops in cultural markets thus not only shape selection, but also, directly or indirectly, the form and direction of cultural innovation.

Method: 通过控制性的词语猜测任务，比较纯人类、纯AI以及人机混合群体在任务表现和结果多样性上的差异，利用语义相似性评分衡量猜测效果。

Result: 混合组表现最佳，兼具高性能和高猜测多样性；人类和AI在混合环境中均调整了自身策略，表现出高阶互动效应；异构AI系统间的协作可部分复现该效果，但人机协作仍更优。

Abstract: Generative AI is increasingly transforming creativity into a hybrid human-artificial process, but its impact on the quality and diversity of creative output remains unclear. We study collective creativity using a controlled word-guessing task that balances open-endedness with an objective measure of task performance. Participants attempt to infer a hidden target word, scored based on the semantic similarity of their guesses to the target, while also observing the best guess from previous players. We compare performance and outcome diversity across human-only, AI-only, and hybrid human-AI groups. Hybrid groups achieve the highest performance while preserving high diversity of guesses. Within hybrid groups, both humans and AI agents systematically adjust their strategies relative to single-agent conditions, suggesting higher-order interaction effects, whereby agents adapt to each other's presence. Although some performance benefits can be reproduced through collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems, human-AI collaboration remains superior, underscoring complementary roles in collective creativity.

Conclusion: 研究结果为互联结构设计提供了显式框架，可用于能量吸收与 containment 控制策略的设计，并兼顾响应速度。

Abstract: Gyroscopic interconnections enable redistribution of energy among degrees of freedom while preserving passivity and total energy, and they play a central role in controlled Lagrangian methods and IDA-PBC. Yet their quantitative effect on transient energy exchange and subsystem performance is not well characterised. We study a conservative mechanical system with constant skew-symmetric velocity coupling. Its dynamics are integrable and evolve on invariant two-tori, whose projections onto subsystem phase planes provide geometric description of energy exchange. When the ratio of normal-mode frequencies is rational, these projections become closed resonant Lissajous curves, enabling structured analysis of subsystem trajectories. To quantify subsystem behaviour, we introduce the inscribed-radius metric: the radius of the largest origin-centred circle contained in a projected trajectory. This gives a lower bound on attainable subsystem energy and acts as an internal performance measure. We derive resonance conditions and develop an efficient method to compute or certify the inscribed radius without time-domain simulation. Our results show that low-order resonances can strongly restrict energy depletion through phase-locking, whereas high-order resonances recover conservative bounds. These insights lead to an explicit interconnection-shaping design framework for both energy absorption and containment control strategies, while taking responsiveness into account.

Abstract: Non-contact current monitoring has emerged as a prominent research focus owing to its non-intrusive characteristics and low maintenance requirements. However, while they offer high sensitivity, contactless sensors necessitate sophisticated design methodologies and thorough experimental validation. In this study, a Giant Magneto-Resistance (GMR) sensor is employed to monitor the instantaneous currents of a three-phase 400-volt overhead line, and its performance is evaluated against that of a conventional contact-based Hall effect sensor. A mathematical framework is developed to calculate current from the measured magnetic field signals. Furthermore, a MATLAB-based dashboard is implemented to enable real-time visualization of current measurements from both sensors under linear and non-linear load conditions. The GMR current sensor achieved a relative accuracy of 64.64% to 91.49%, with most phases above 80%. Identified improvements over this are possible, indicating that the sensing method has potential as a basis for calculating phase currents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模拟退火（SA）被广泛使用，但其理论理解主要局限于渐近收敛保证或一般的谱界，缺乏对有限时间内行为的精确刻画。本文旨在建立一个适用于恒温SA的有限时间分析框架，以更准确地描述其优化动态。

Abstract: Simulated Annealing (SA) is a widely used stochastic optimization algorithm, yet much of its theoretical understanding is limited to asymptotic convergence guarantees or general spectral bounds. In this paper, we develop a finite-time analytical framework for constant-temperature SA by studying a piecewise linear cost function that permits exact characterization. We model SA as a discrete-state Markov chain and first derive a closed-form expression for the expected time to escape a single linear basin in a one-dimensional landscape. We show that this expression also accurately predicts the behavior of continuous-state searches up to a constant scaling factor, which we analyze empirically and explain via variance matching, demonstrating convergence to a factor of sqrt(3) in certain regimes.
  We then extend the analysis to a two-basin landscape containing a local and a global optimum, obtaining exact expressions for the expected time to reach the global optimum starting from the local optimum, as a function of basin geometry, neighborhood radius, and temperature. Finally, we demonstrate how the predicted basin escape time can be used to guide the design of a simple two-temperature switching strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计算法常依赖局部坐标或四元数表示，易出现奇异性或“退绕”问题，且难以保证快速收敛与噪声鲁棒性。为实现对任意刚体运动的高效、稳定估计，尤其适用于自主系统，需要一种直接定义在李群SE(3)上的有限时间稳定估计方法。

Method: 基于李群SE(3)的切丛状态空间，利用李导数与几何力学原理构建全状态观测器；通过李雅普诺夫分析证明其有限时间稳定性与对有界测量噪声的鲁棒性；采用几何离散化方法实现数值与实验部署；设计了一种仅使用点云和陀螺仪数据、无需平移速度输入的简化版本。

Result: 数值仿真表明FTS-PE在收敛速度与精度上优于对偶四元数扩展卡尔曼滤波器和先前提出的变分姿态估计器（VPE）；实验使用Zed 2i双目深度相机获取点云与角速度数据，验证了该方法在真实传感器噪声下的稳定性与实用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的FTS-PE是一种直接定义在SE(3)流形上的有限时间稳定全状态观测器，具有快速收敛、抗噪能力强、无奇异性等优点，适用于复杂环境下的自主飞行器与机器人系统的实时姿态估计任务。

Abstract: This work presents a finite-time stable pose estimator (FTS-PE) for rigid bodies undergoing rotational and translational motion in three dimensions, using measurements from onboard sensors that provide position vectors to inertially-fixed points and body velocities. The FTS-PE is a full-state observer for the pose (position and orientation) and velocities and is obtained through a Lyapunov analysis that shows its stability in finite time and its robustness to bounded measurement noise. Further, this observer is designed directly on the state space, the tangent bundle of the Lie group of rigid body motions, SE(3), without using local coordinates or (dual) quaternion representations. Therefore, it can estimate arbitrary rigid body motions without encountering singularities or the unwinding phenomenon and be readily applied to autonomous vehicles. A version of this observer that does not need translational velocity measurements and uses only point clouds and angular velocity measurements from rate gyros, is also obtained. It is discretized using the framework of geometric mechanics for numerical and experimental implementations. The numerical simulations compare the FTS-PE with a dual-quaternion extended Kalman filter and our previously developed variational pose estimator (VPE). The experimental results are obtained using point cloud images and rate gyro measurements obtained from a Zed 2i stereo depth camera sensor. These results validate the stability and robustness of the FTS-PE.

Abstract: The accurate characterization of tire dynamics is critical for advancing control strategies in autonomous road vehicles, as tire behavior significantly influences handling and stability through the generation of forces and moments at the tire-road interface. Smart tire technologies have emerged as a promising tool for sensing key variables such as road friction, tire pressure, and wear states, and for estimating kinematic and dynamic states like vehicle speed and tire forces. However, most existing estimation and control algorithms rely on empirical correlations or machine learning approaches, which require extensive calibration and can be sensitive to variations in operating conditions. In contrast, model-based techniques, which leverage infinite-dimensional representations of tire dynamics using partial differential equations (PDEs), offer a more robust approach. This paper proposes a novel model-based, output-feedback lateral tracking control strategy for all-wheel steering vehicles that integrates distributed tire dynamics with smart tire technologies. The primary contributions include the suppression of micro-shimmy phenomena at low speeds and path-following via force control, achieved through the estimation of tire slip angles, vehicle kinematics, and lateral tire forces. The proposed controller and observer are based on formulations using ODE-PDE systems, representing rigid body dynamics and distributed tire behavior. This work marks the first rigorous control strategy for vehicular systems equipped with distributed tire representations in conjunction with smart tire technologies.

Abstract: Dynamic models, particularly rate-dependent models, have proven effective in capturing the key phenomenological features of frictional processes, whilst also possessing important mathematical properties that facilitate the design of control and estimation algorithms. However, many rate-dependent formulations are built on empirical considerations, whereas physical derivations may offer greater interpretability. In this context, starting from fundamental physical principles, this paper introduces a novel class of first-order dynamic friction models that approximate the dynamics of a bristle element by inverting the friction characteristic. Amongst the developed models, a specific formulation closely resembling the LuGre model is derived using a simple rheological equation for the bristle element. This model is rigorously analyzed in terms of stability and passivity -- important properties that support the synthesis of observers and controllers. Furthermore, a distributed version, formulated as a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), is presented, which enables the modeling of frictional processes commonly encountered in rolling contact phenomena. The tribological behavior of the proposed description is evaluated through classical experiments and validated against the response predicted by the LuGre model, revealing both notable similarities and key differences.

Abstract: Urban energy systems face increasing challenges due to high penetration of renewable energy sources, extreme weather events, and other high-impact, low-probability disruptions. This project proposes a community-centered, open-access framework to enhance the resilience and reliability of urban power and gas networks by integrating microgrid partitioning, mobile energy storage deployment, and data-driven risk assessment. The approach involves converting passive distribution networks into active, self-healing microgrids using distributed energy resources and remotely controlled switches to enable flexible reconfiguration during normal and emergency operations. To address uncertainties from intermittent renewable generation and variable load, an adjustable interval optimization method combined with a column and constraint generation algorithm is developed, providing robust planning solutions without requiring probabilistic information. Additionally, a real-time online risk assessment tool is proposed, leveraging 25 multi-dimensional indices including load, grid status, resilient resources, emergency response, and meteorological factors to support operational decision-making during extreme events. The framework also optimizes the long-term sizing and allocation of mobile energy storage units while incorporating urban traffic data for effective routing during emergencies. Finally, a novel time-dependent resilience and reliability index is introduced to quantify system performance under diverse operating conditions. The proposed methodology aims to enable resilient, efficient, and adaptable urban energy networks capable of withstanding high-impact disruptions while maximizing operational and economic benefits.

Abstract: Modern applications, such as orchestrating the collective behavior of robotic swarms or traffic flows, require the coordination of large groups of agents evolving in unstructured environments, where disturbances and unmodeled dynamics are unavoidable. In this work, we develop a scalable macroscopic density control framework in which a feedback law is designed directly at the level of an advection--diffusion partial differential equation. We formulate the control problem in the density space and prove global exponential convergence towards the desired behavior in $\mathcal{L}^2$ with guaranteed asymptotic rejection of bounded unknown drift terms, explicitly accounting for heterogeneous agent dynamics, unmodeled behaviors, and environmental perturbations. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by numerical experiments spanning heterogeneous oscillators, traffic systems, and swarm robotics in partially unknown environments.

Abstract: While data-driven weather models have achieved remarkable deterministic accuracy, they fundamentally rely on discrete-time mappings and closed-system assumptions, failing to capture the multi-scale continuous dynamics and thermodynamic openness of the atmosphere. To address these limitations, we propose UniPhy, a continuous-time non-Hermitian neural stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) solver. Geometrically, we employ Riemannian-Clifford gauge transformations to flatten planetary heterogeneity, enabling globally consistent operations. Dynamically, we construct non-Hermitian biorthogonal spectral operators integrated with a global flux tracker to capture transient energy growth and open-system exchange. Computationally, by identifying the algebraic associativity of the analytic solution, we reformulate adaptive physical integration as a parallel prefix-sum problem, achieving log-linear sequence parallelism. UniPhy establishes a physically complete foundation model architecture that unifies geometric adaptivity, thermodynamic consistency, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Brittle materials subjected to thermal shocks experience strong temperature gradients that in turn give rise to mechanical stresses that can be large enough to induce fracture. This work presents a complete model for phase-field fracture for coupled thermo-mechanical problems, wherein the bulk material properties, the material strength, and the fracture toughness are specified independently. The capabilities of the model are assessed across a wide span of scenarios in thermo-mechanical fracture, from the propagation of large pre-existing cracks to crack nucleation under spatially uniform states of stress. In particular, we revisit the controlled quenching of glass plates, and demonstrate how the model captures experimentally observed crack patterns across a range of thermal loads. Ceramic disks subjected to infrared radiation are also examined, with the model reproducing both straight cracks in notched specimens and branching in intact specimens. Finally, ceramic pellets subjected to rapid power pulses are examined, with the model explaining experimental transitions from intact to fractured pellets and the important role of material strength. The results demonstrate that the complete phase-field model unifies the treatment of distinct fracture scenarios under thermal shock, surpassing classical approaches and enabling more reliable prediction of brittle fracture in extreme environments.

Abstract: This study presents the development of a compact gas-kinetic scheme using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for structured meshes. Unlike the Eulerian formulation, the ALE approach effectively tracks flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and contact discontinuities. However, mesh motion alters the geometry and increases computational costs. To address this, two key strategies were introduced to reduce costs and enhance accuracy. The first strategy is to use the gas-kinetic scheme to construct a third-order gas-kinetic flux, rather than the Runge-Kutta method to achieve high-order time accuracy, which allows a single reconstruction and flux calculation per time step. This approach enables direct updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients using a time-accurate flux function, facilitating compact reconstruction. Second, the significant computational expense is spent on reconstruction, which requires recalculating the reconstruction matrix at each time step due to mesh changes. A simplified fourth-order compact reconstruction using a small matrix was used to mitigate this cost. The combination of fourth-order spatial reconstruction and third-order time-accurate flux evolution ensures both high resolution and computational efficiency in the ALE framework. The tests shows that the current reconstruction is 2.4x to 3.0x faster than the previous reconstruction. Additionally, a generalized ENO(GENO) method for handling discontinuities enhances the scheme's robustness. The numerical test cases, such as the Riemann problem, Sedov problem, Noh problem, and Saltzmann problem, demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of our method.

Abstract: High-temperature spin transport in integrable quantum spin chains exhibits a rich dynamical phase diagram, including ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes. While integrability is known to survive in static and periodically driven systems, its fate in the complete absence of time-translation symmetry, particularly in interacting random quantum circuits, has remained unclear. Here we construct integrable random quantum circuits built from inhomogeneous XXZ R-matrices. Remarkably, integrability is preserved for arbitrary sequences of gate layers, ranging from quasiperiodic to fully random, thereby explicitly breaking both continuous and discrete time-translation symmetry. Using large-scale time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group simulations at infinite temperature and half filling, we map out the resulting spin-transport phase diagram and identify ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes controlled by the spectral parameters of the R-matrices. The spatiotemporal structure of spin correlations within each regime depends sensitively on the inhomogeneity, exhibiting spatial asymmetry and sharp peak structures tied to near-degenerate quasiparticle velocities. To account for these findings, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics framework adapted to time-dependent integrable circuits, yielding Euler-scale predictions for correlation functions, Drude weights, and diffusion bounds. This approach identifies the quasiparticles governing transport and quantitatively captures both the scaling exponents and fine structures of the correlation profiles observed numerically. Our results demonstrate that exact Yang-Baxter integrability is compatible with stochastic quantum dynamics and establish generalized hydrodynamics as a predictive framework for transport in time-dependent integrable systems.

Abstract: Chirality in active and passive fluids gives rise to odd transport properties, most notably the emergence of robust edge currents that defy standard dissipative dynamics. While these phenomena are well-described by continuum hydrodynamics, a microscopic framework connecting them to their topological origins has remained elusive. Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p<1$). This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators. Our results provide a discrete microscopic description for odd diffusion, offering a powerful toolkit to predict transport in confined geometries and disordered chiral media.

### [104] [Impact of Market Reforms on Deterministic Frequency Deviations in the European Power Grid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09645)
*Philipp C. Böttcher,Carsten Hartmann,Andrea Benigni,Thiemo Pesch,Dirk Witthaut*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 欧洲2025年10月1日的日前市场改革将交易时段从小时级改为15分钟级，显著减少了电网频率的系统性偏差，抑制了每小时和半小时尺度的主导频谱成分，但15分钟级波动相对增强；尽管大幅偏离频率的发生概率总体下降，极端事件的改善程度因指标而异，表明需结合技术与监管措施进一步应对低惯量系统中的大频率波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力市场调度引发的同步发电爬坡会导致系统性且可预测的电网频率偏差（DFDs），影响电网稳定性，尤其是在低惯量电力系统中。2025年欧洲日前市场改革引入15分钟交易区块，旨在提高调度精度，但其对频率稳定性的影响尚不明确，因此需要评估该改革对DFDs的实际效果。

Method: 基于公开的电网频率测量数据，采用多种统计与信号处理方法，包括日频率曲线对比、频率偏差指标分析、主成分分析（PCA）、基于傅里叶的函数型数据分析以及功率谱密度分析，比较改革前后中欧同步电网区域的频率行为变化。

Result: 改革显著降低了每小时尺度的特征性频率偏差，并抑制了每小时和半小时时间尺度上的主导频谱成分；相比之下，15分钟尺度的频率结构相对变得更加明显。整体上大频率偏差发生的可能性降低，但极端事件的改善程度依赖于所使用的评估指标。

Conclusion: 市场设计改革能够有效缓解系统性频率偏差，提升电网运行的稳定性；然而，在低惯量电力系统中进一步减少大频率波动仍需依赖技术手段与监管政策的协同作用。

Abstract: Deterministic frequency deviations (DFDs) are systematic and predictable excursions of grid frequency that arise from synchronized generation ramps induced by electricity market scheduling. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the European day-ahead market reform of 1 October 2025, which replaced hourly trading blocks with quarter-hourly blocks, on DFDs in the Central European synchronous area. Using publicly available frequency measurements, we compare periods before and after the reform based on daily frequency profiles, indicators characterizing frequency deviations, principal component analysis, Fourier-based functional data analysis, and power spectral density analysis. We show that the reform substantially reduces characteristic hourly frequency deviations and suppresses dominant spectral components at hourly and half-hourly time scales, while quarter-hourly structures gain relative importance. While the likelihood of large frequency deviations decreases overall, reductions for extreme events are less clear and depend on the metric used. Our results demonstrate that market design reforms can effectively mitigate systematic frequency deviations, but also highlight that complementary technical and regulatory measures are required to further reduce large frequency excursions in low-inertia power systems.

TL;DR: 研究了一维具有平均非可逆对称性的无序系统，提出基于二维拓扑序的拓扑全息框架，实现了对平均对称性保护拓扑相和反常的完整分类，并构造了精确可解格点模型验证理论预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在淬火无序下部分对称性仅在平均意义上保持的系统的拓扑性质与临界行为，扩展传统对称性保护拓扑相的理论框架。

Method: 发展了一个拓扑全息框架，将一维系统的对称性数据编码到由Drinfeld中心描述的二维拓扑序中，并引入平均G对称性进行增强；通过磁性拉格朗日代数的存在性判断反常；构造基于对称性增强弦网结构的精确可解格点模型。

Result: 得到了平均SPT相和反常的完整分类：当非平凡G分次成分仅在平均下实现时，系统无反常当且仅当Z[A]存在G作用下不变的磁性拉格朗日代数；若存在反常，则单个无序实现的基态以概率1呈现长程纠缠并表现出幂律Griffiths奇异行为；提出了一个精确可解模型，在无反常时给出平庸基态系综，在有平均反常时展现奇特低能行为。

Conclusion: 平均非可逆对称性可导致新的拓扑分类和奇异低能物理，拓扑全息框架为理解此类无序系统中的对称性保护现象提供了统一工具。

Abstract: We study one-dimensional disordered systems with average non-invertible symmetries, where quenched disorder may locally break part of the symmetry while preserving it upon disorder averaging. A canonical example is the random transverse-field Ising model, which at criticality exhibits an average Kramers-Wannier duality. We consider the general setting in which the full symmetry is described by a $G$-graded fusion category $\mathcal{B}$, whose identity component $\mathcal{A}$ remains exact, while the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized either exactly or only on average. We develop a topological holographic framework that encodes the symmetry data of the 1D system in a 2D topological order $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ (the Drinfeld center of $\mathcal{A}$), enriched by an exact or, respectively, average $G$ symmetry. Within this framework, we obtain a complete classification of anomalies and average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases: when the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized only on average, the symmetry is anomaly-free if and only if $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ admits a magnetic Lagrangian algebra that is invariant under the permutation action of $G$ on anyons. When an anomaly is present, we show that the ground state of a single disorder realization is long-range entangled with probability one in the thermodynamic limit, and is expected to exhibit power-law Griffiths singularities in the low-energy spectrum. Finally, we present an explicit, exactly solvable lattice model based on a symmetry-enriched string-net construction. It yields trivial ground state ensemble in the anomaly-free case, and exhibits exotic low-energy behavior in the presence of an average anomaly.

Abstract: This paper considers the scattering of a time-harmonic acoustic plane wave by an elastic body with an unbounded periodic surface. The original problem can be confined to the analysis of the fields in one periodic cell. With the help of the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique, we can truncate the unbounded physical domain into a bounded computational domain. By respectively constructing the equivalent transparent boundary conditions of acoustic and elastic waves simultaneously, the well-posedness and exponential convergence of the solution to the associated truncated PML problem are established. The finite element method is applied to solve the PML problem of acoustic-elastic interaction. To address the singularity caused by the non-smooth surface of the elastic body, we establish a residual-type a posteriori error estimate and develop an adaptive PML finite element algorithm. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive algorithm.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm designed for nonlinear least-squares problems. The method is derived by preconditioning the gradient descent direction using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the Jacobian. This SVD-based preconditioner is then integrated with the first- and second-moment adaptive learning rate mechanism of the Adam optimizer. We establish the local linear convergence of the proposed method under standard regularity assumptions and prove global convergence for a modified version of the algorithm under suitable conditions. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated experimentally across a range of tasks, including function approximation, partial differential equation (PDE) solving, and image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms standard Adam, achieving faster convergence and lower error in both regression and classification settings.

Method: 采用冯·诺依曼稳定性分析方法，分别研究显式和隐式ADER-DG方法在经典和退化时空几何下的稳定性特性，特别在1D情况下通过虚构插入退化单元模拟Voronoi网格重构行为。

Result: 确认了显式ADER-DG方法的CFL稳定性条件及其局限性；明确了ALE方法在特定网格速度条件下基于给定CFL的稳定性；发现即使在包含退化时空单元的情况下，显式和隐式ADER-DG方法的CFL稳定性约束与经典情况相同。

Conclusion: 退化时空单元的引入不影响ADER-DG方法的CFL稳定性条件，为在拓扑变化场景中使用此类单元的直接ALE方法奠定了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a thorough von Neumann stability analysis of explicit and implicit Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods on classical and degenerate spacetime geometries for hyperbolic equations. First, we rigorously study the CFL stability conditions for the explicit ADER-DG method, confirming results widely used in the literature while specifying their limitations. Moreover, we highlight under which conditions on the mesh velocity the ALE methods, constrained to a given CFL, are actually stable. Next, we extend the stability study to ADER-DG in the presence of degenerate spacetime elements, with zero size at the beginning and the end of the time step, but with a non zero spacetime volume. This kind of elements has been introduced in a series of articles on direct ALE methods by Gaburro et al. to connect via spacetime control volumes regenerated Voronoi tessellations after a topology change. Here, we imitate this behavior in 1d by fictitiously inserting degenerate elements in between two cells. Then, we show that over this degenerate spacetime geometry, both for the explicit and implicit ADER-DG, the CFL stability constraints remain the same as those for classical geometries, laying the theoretical foundations for their use in the context of ALE methods.

Abstract: Regularizing a linear ill-posed operator equation can be achieved by manipulating the spectrum of the operator's pseudo-inverse. Tikhonov regularization and spectral cutoff are well-known techniques within this category. This paper introduces an interpolating formula that defines a one-parameter family of regularizations, where Tikhonov and spectral cutoff methods are represented as limiting cases. By adjusting the interpolating parameter taking into account the specific operator equation under consideration, it is possible to mitigate the limitations associated with both Tikhonov and spectral cutoff regularizations. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations in the fields of signal and image processing.

The linear-map-based tensor-tensor multiplication is a matrix-mimetic operation that extends the notion of matrix multiplication to higher order tensors, and which is a generalization of the T-product. Under this framework, we introduce the tensor CUR decomposition, show its performance in video foreground-background separation for different linear maps and compare it to a robust matrix CUR decomposition, another tensor approximation and the slice-based singular value decomposition (SS-SVD). We also provide a theoretical analysis of our tensor CUR decomposition, extending classical matrix results to establish exactness conditions and perturbation bounds.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a new method for the unsteady incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations on convex domains with hybrid approximations of both vector-valued and scalar-valued fields. The proposed method is convection-semirobust, meaning that, for sufficiently smooth solutions, one can derive a priori estimates for the velocity and the magnetic field that do not depend on the inverse of the diffusion coefficients. This is achieved while at the same time providing relevant additional features, namely an improved order of convergence for the (asymptotic) diffusion-dominated regime, a small stencil (owing to the absence of inter-element penalty terms), and the possibility to significantly reduce the size of the algebraic problems through static condensation. The theoretical results are confirmed by a complete panel of numerical experiments.

Method: 引入传输多项式精确性（TPE(k)）作为新准则，并提出通过兼容离散物理变量的辅助输运方程求解演化几何矩（EGMs），结合SSPRK3时间积分构造满足TPE(2)的三阶守恒有限体积移动网格格式。

Result: 证明了在SSPRK3下二阶EGMs与真实几何矩完全一致，源于超收敛机制（退化为Simpson法则）；新方案在任意（包括不连续）网格运动下保持三阶收敛和TPE(2)性质，且伪时间步数从O(h⁻¹)降至O(1)，大幅提升效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的EGM框架打破了传统再映射步骤的效率瓶颈，在极端网格变形下仍保持高阶精度和稳定性，为高阶移动网格方法的实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: High-order moving-mesh methods can effectively reduce numerical diffusion, but their formal accuracy typically relies on the regularity of the mesh velocity. This dependency creates a fundamental conflict in the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws, where solution-driven adaptation may induce nonsmooth mesh motion, thereby degrading convergence order. We introduce \emph{transport polynomial exactness} (TPE($k$)), a mesh-motion-independent criterion that generalizes classical free-stream preservation (TPE(0)) to the exact advection of degree-$k$ polynomials. We show that the classical geometric conservation law (GCL) is insufficient to ensure TPE($k$) for $k \ge 1$ due to mismatches in higher-order geometric moments. To resolve this, we propose \emph{evolved geometric moments} (EGMs), obtained by solving auxiliary transport equations discretized compatibly with the physical variables. We rigorously prove that second-degree EGMs evolved via the third-order strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta (SSPRK3) method coincide with the exact geometric moments. This exactness arises from a \emph{superconvergence} mechanism wherein SSPRK3 reduces to Simpson's rule for EGM evolution. Leveraging this result, we construct a third-order conservative finite-volume rezoning moving-mesh scheme. The scheme satisfies the TPE(2) property for \emph{arbitrary mesh motion} and \emph{any pseudo-time step size}, thereby naturally accommodating spatiotemporally discontinuous mesh velocity. Crucially, this \emph{breaks the efficiency bottleneck} in the conventional advection-based remapping step and reduces the required pseudo-time levels from $\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ under bounded but discontinuous mesh velocity. Numerical experiments verify exact quadratic transport and stable third-order convergence under extreme mesh deformation, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains.

### [115] [Asymptotic error distribution for tamed Euler method with coupled monotonicity condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09854)
*Xinjie Dai,Diancong Jin,Jiaoyang Xu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文研究了在耦合单调性条件下，由乘性噪声驱动的随机微分方程（SDEs）的截断欧拉方法的渐近误差分布，提出了一种参数化的截断欧拉方法，并建立了其强收敛率为 $α\wedge\frac{1}{2}$。进一步推导出该方法的渐近误差分布，并比较了不同参数下长期均方误差的表现，扩展结果至加性噪声情形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了分析具有超线性增长系数的SDEs在数值求解中的渐近误差行为，尤其是在乘性噪声下的截断欧拉方法的极限误差分布，弥补现有理论在该类问题上的不足。

Method: 引入一个参数 $α\in (0, 1]$ 的截断欧拉方法，基于耦合单调性条件分析其强收敛性，并通过正则化系数调节实现稳定收敛；利用极限方程推导归一化误差过程的渐近分布，进一步比较不同 $α$ 值对应的长期误差表现。

Result: 证明了截断欧拉方法的强收敛率为 $α\wedge\frac{1}{2}$；得出当 $α=\frac{1}{2}$ 时长期均方误差最大，而 $α>\frac{1}{2}$ 的方法具有统一的渐近误差分布；并将结论推广到加性噪声情形。

Conclusion: 对于满足耦合单调性条件的SDEs，参数 $α=\frac{1}{2}$ 的截断欧拉方法虽达到最优强收敛阶，但在长期模拟中误差最大；更优的 $α>\frac{1}{2}$ 配置可带来更优的渐近误差表现，且不影响收敛速率，为数值方法设计提供了新指导。

Abstract: This paper establishes the asymptotic error distribution of the tamed Euler method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a coupled monotonicity condition, that is, the limit distribution of the corresponding normalized error process. Specifically, for SDEs driven by multiplicative noise, we first propose a tamed Euler method parameterized by $α\in (0, 1]$ and establish that its strong convergence rate is $α\wedge\frac{1}{2}$. Notably, $α$ can take arbitrary positive values by adjusting the regularization coefficient without altering the strong convergence rate. We then derive the asymptotic error distribution for this tamed Euler method. Further, we infer from the limit equation that among the tamed Euler method of strong order $\frac{1}{2}$, the one with $α= \frac{1}{2}$ yields the largest mean-square error after a long time, while those of $α>\frac{1}{2}$ share a unified asymptotic error distribution. In addition, our analysis is also extended to SDEs with additive noise and similar conclusions are obtained. Additional treatments are required to accommodate super-linearly growing coefficients, a feature that distinguishes our analysis on the asymptotic error distribution from established results.

TL;DR: 本研究利用蒙特卡洛模拟和实验验证，提出了一种基于干体积密度和体积含水量的简单中子衰减预测模型，可用于实地快速校正非弹性中子散射-伴随粒子成像（INS-API）技术中的中子衰减，从而实现对土壤元素成分（包括碳）的自洽测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确解释INS-API数据需要校正土壤中伽马射线和中子的衰减，其中中子衰减受多种因素影响，建模复杂，限制了其在实地的应用。因此需要一种简单且实用的中子衰减校正方法。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛模拟不同组分、体积密度和含水量的土壤中的中子衰减，并据此建立仅需干体积密度和体积含水量的简化预测模型，随后使用可控土柱实验结合INS-API系统对该模型进行实验验证。

Result: 所提出的模型在30厘米深度范围内与实验数据吻合度在10%以内，能够有效预测中子衰减。

Conclusion: 该模型为INS-API技术提供了实用的中子衰减校正手段，推动了其在大范围土壤碳评估等实地应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) enables rapid, non-destructive in situ measurements of soil elemental composition over large soil volumes. Standard INS yields bulk elemental concentrations, but spatially resolved measurements require techniques such as Associated Particle Imaging (API), which pairs neutron detection with coincident alpha detection to reconstruct the location of the neutron interaction. One of the unique advantages of API is its capability to measure all major soil components simultaneously, allowing for the estimation of both bulk density and water content directly from the measured neutron-induced gamma-ray spectra. Accurate interpretation of bulk INS-API data depends on correcting for both gamma-ray and neutron attenuation in soil. Although gamma attenuation can be calculated from known mass attenuation coefficient data and density, neutron attenuation is more complex, depending on neutron energy, soil composition, bulk density, and hydrogen content from water and organic matter. We use Monte Carlo simulations of soils with varied compositions, bulk densities, and water contents to model neutron attenuation and develop a simple predictive model requiring only dry bulk density and volumetric water content. We validate this model experimentally using an INS-API system with controlled soil columns, finding agreement within 10 percent at 30 cm depth. This approach enables practical, field-ready correction of INS-API measurements for neutron attenuation, laying the groundwork for a self-consistent measurement framework that can address the elemental composition of soil carbon assessments.

TL;DR: 将基于分数的扩散模型应用于二维SU(2)格点规范理论，通过四元数参数化处理流形结构，并利用物理条件采样生成不同耦合常数和格点尺寸的构型，结果与精确解析预测高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展在U(1)规范理论上的近期工作，探索扩散模型在非阿贝尔规范场生成中的适用性，特别是处理SU(2)群的流形结构问题。

Method: 采用基于分数的扩散模型，结合四元数参数化表示SU(2)流形；使用Hybrid Monte Carlo生成训练数据，并通过随机规范变换增强样本；利用β依赖性的线性特性实现无需重新训练的条件采样；采用具有周期边界条件的全卷积U-Net架构以支持不同格点尺寸的生成。

Result: 在8×8格点上训练后，模型能在β∈[1.5,2.5]范围内以偏差|Δ|≤0.001复现平均plaquette值，在β∈[1,4]范围内偏差小于0.06；对于至少一个方向为L=8的格点，β∈[1.5,2.5]时偏差低于~0.003；并通过生成不同β和格点大小的构型验证了模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在非阿贝尔规范场生成中展现出良好潜力，为未来应用于更高维规范理论提供了基础。

Abstract: We apply score-based diffusion models to two-dimensional SU(2) lattice pure gauge theory with the Wilson action, extending recent work on U(1) gauge theories. The SU(2) manifold structure is handled through a quaternion parameterization. The model is trained on 10,000 configurations generated via Hybrid Monte Carlo at a fixed coupling $β_0= 2.0$ on an $8\times 8$ lattice, augmented to 20,000 samples via random gauge transformations. Through physics-conditioned sampling exploiting the linear $β$-dependence of the score function, we generate configurations at different values of the coupling without retraining; through the fully convolutional U-Net architecture with periodic boundary conditions, we generate configurations on lattices of different spatial extents. We validate our approach by comparing the average plaquette and Wilson action density against exact analytical predictions. At the training lattice size ($8\times 8$), the model reproduces the exact plaquette with biases $|Δ| \leq 0.001$ for $β\in [1.5, 2.5]$ and $|Δ| < 0.06$ across $β\in [1, 4]$. For lattices sharing the training extent $L=8$ in at least one direction, biases remain below $\sim 0.003$ for $β\in [1.5, 2.5]$, with larger deviations at higher couplings. This work demonstrates that diffusion models are a promising tool for non-Abelian gauge field generation and motivates further investigation toward higher-dimensional theories.

Conclusion: QCD真空的对偶超导性是对色禁闭机制的合理解释，且通过独立方法验证了禁闭现象的存在。

Abstract: In this paper we produce evidence that confinement of colour is due to dual superconductivity of $QCD$ vacuum. To do that we put together results of old numerical simulations and results of more recent investigations. The starting point is the expectation that gauge theories admit a dual description in terms of monopoles. The strategy is then to construct the creation operator $μ$ of a monopole and to compute its vacuum expectation value $\langle μ\rangle$ , the disorder parameter which indicates dual superconductivity. The Imechanism of confinement is dual superconductivity of vacuum if $\langle μ\rangle \neq 0 $ in the confined phase , and $\langle μ\rangle =0$ in the deconfined phase. Confinement has to be certified by independent methods.
  It is shown that gauge invariance requires that field strengths be replaced by gauge invariant field strengths, which are their parallel transports to infinity. The resulting disorder parameter is a sum of correlation functions of gauge invariant field strength, and its behaviour understood by use of existing lattice data of two-point gauge invariant correlations.
  As a byproduct an apparent existing inconsistency, the lack of preferred orientation in colour space of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes, is resolved.

Conclusion: 在所研究的能量区域之间，没有证据表明存在束缚态或共振态。

Abstract: We study near-threshold $D\bar{D}$ scattering in $S$ and $D$-wave to determine whether or not resonances or bound states are present. Working in the approximation where charm-annihilation is forbidden, with two degenerate light-quark flavors and a heavier strange quark, isospin is a good quantum number, and the only other other channel that is kinematically open is $η_cη$. Using lattice QCD we compute, as a function of varying light-quark mass, the $S$-matrix for coupled-channel $η_cη- D\bar{D}$ scattering and find only weakly interacting meson pairs. In contrast to several other studies, we find no evidence for any bound-state or resonance singularity in the energy region between the deeply-bound $χ_{c0}(1P)$ state and the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ threshold.

Conclusion: simplicity是一种有潜力的新型序参量，为理解QCD相结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce a novel observable associated to Abelian monopole currents defined in the Maximal Abelian Projection of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory that captures the topology of the current loop. This observable, referred to as the $\textit{simplicity}$, is defined as the ratio of the zeroth over the first Betti number of the current graph for a given field configuration. A numerical study of the expectation value of the simplicity performed in the framework of Lattice Gauge Theories enables us to determine the deconfinement temperature to a higher degree of accuracy than that reached by conventional methods at a comparable computational effort. Our results suggest that Abelian current loops are strongly correlated with the degrees of freedoms of the theory that determine confinement. Our investigation opens new perspectives for the definition of an order parameter for deconfinement in Quantum Chromodynamics able to expose the potentially rich phase structure of the theory.

Abstract: Iteration limited model predictive control (MPC) can stabilize a feedback control system under sufficient conditions; this work explores combining a low iteration limit MPC with a high iteration limit MPC for mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) where the suboptimality is due to solver iteration limits. To combine the two MPCs a hybrid systems controller is developed that ``unites'' two MIQP-MPC solvers where the iteration limits of interest are the branch-and-bound and quadratic programming iteration limits. Asymptotic stability and robustness of the hybrid feedback control system are theoretically derived. Then an interpretable branch-and-bound algorithm and implementable uniting controller algorithm are developed. Finally, the developed algorithms and varying iteration limits are empirically evaluated in simulation for the switching thruster and minimum thrust spacecraft rendezvous problems.

Abstract: We consider infinite-dimensional linear Gaussian Bayesian inverse problems with uncorrelated sensor data, and focus on the problem of finding sensor placements that maximize the expected information gain (EIG). This study is motivated by optimal sensor placement for linear inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs). We consider measurement models where each sensor collects a single-snapshot measurement. This covers sensor placement for inverse problems governed by linear steady PDEs or evolution equations with final-in-time observations. It is well-known that in the finite-dimensional (discretized) formulations of such inverse problems, EIG is a monotone submodular function. This also entails a theoretical guarantee for greedy sensor placement in the discretized setting. We extend the result on submodularity of the EIG to the infinite-dimensional setting, proving that the approximation guarantee of greedy sensor placement remains valid in the infinite-dimensional limit. We also discuss computational considerations and present strategies that exploit problem structure and submodularity to yield an efficient implementation of the greedy procedure.

Abstract: Many modern iterative solvers for large-scale tomographic reconstruction incur two major computational costs per iteration: expensive forward/adjoint projections to update the data fidelity term and costly proximal computations for the regulariser, often done via inner iterations. This paper studies for the first time the application of methods that couple randomised skipping of the proximal with variance-reduced subset-based optimisation of data-fit term, to simultaneously reduce both costs in challenging tomographic reconstruction tasks. We provide a series of experiments using both synthetic and real data, demonstrating striking speed-ups of the order 5x--20x compared to the non-skipped counterparts which have been so far the standard approach for efficiently solving these problems. Our work lays the groundwork for broader adoption of these methods in inverse problems.

Abstract: To every nearly convex optimization problem, that is a minimization problem with a nearly convex objective function and a nearly convex constraint set, we associate a uniquely defined convex optimization problem with a lower semicontinuous objective function and a closed constraint set. Interesting relationships between the original nearly convex problem and the associated convex problem are established. Optimality conditions in the form of Fermat's rules are obtained for both problems. We then get a Lagrange multiplier rule for a nearly convex optimization problem under a geometrical constraint and functional constraints from the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for the associated convex optimization problem. The obtained results are illustrated by concrete examples.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the input-to-state stabilization problem for an ordinary differential equation (ODE) cascaded by parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) in the presence of Dirichlet-Robin boundary disturbances, as well as in-domain disturbances. For the cascaded system with a Dirichlet pointwise interconnection, the ODE takes the value of a Robin boundary condition at the ODE-PDE interface as its direct input, and the PDE is driven by a Dirichlet boundary input at the opposite end. We first employ the backstepping method to design a boundary controller and to decouple the cascaded system. This decoupling facilitates independent stability analysis of the PDE and ODE systems sequentially. Then, to address the challenges posed by Dirichlet boundary disturbances to the application of the classical Lyapunov method, we utilize the generalized Lyapunov method to establish the ISS in the max-norm for the cascaded system involving Dirichlet boundary disturbances and two other types of disturbances. The obtained result indicates that even in the presence of different types of disturbances, ISS analysis can still be conducted within the framework of Lyapunov stability theory. For the well-posedness of the target system, it is conducted by using the technique of lifting and the semigroup method. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and ISS properties for a cascaded system with different disturbances.

Conclusion: 所采用的距离函数和反事实的鲁棒性对模型的安全性有重大影响，设计解释系统时需权衡可解释性与安全性。

Abstract: In model extraction attacks, the goal is to reveal the parameters of a black-box machine learning model by querying the model for a selected set of data points. Due to an increasing demand for explanations, this may involve counterfactual queries besides the typically considered factual queries. In this work, we consider linear models and three types of queries: factual, counterfactual, and robust counterfactual. First, for an arbitrary set of queries, we derive novel mathematical formulations for the classification regions for which the decision of the unknown model is known, without recovering any of the model parameters. Second, we derive bounds on the number of queries needed to extract the model's parameters for (robust) counterfactual queries under arbitrary norm-based distances. We show that the full model can be recovered using just a single counterfactual query when differentiable distance measures are employed. In contrast, when using polyhedral distances for instance, the number of required queries grows linearly with the dimension of the data space. For robust counterfactuals, the latter number of queries doubles. Consequently, the applied distance function and robustness of counterfactuals have a significant impact on the model's security.

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of stochastic optimization methods in terms of their sensitivity with respect to the step size. We identify a key quantity that, for each method, describes how the performance degrades as the step size becomes too large. For convex problems, we show that this quantity directly impacts the suboptimality bound of the method. Most importantly, our analysis provides direct theoretical evidence that adaptive step-size methods, such as SPS or NGN, are more robust than SGD. This allows us to quantify the advantage of these adaptive methods beyond empirical evaluation. Finally, we show through experiments that our theoretical bound qualitatively mirrors the actual performance as a function of the step size, even for nonconvex problems.

Abstract: We study a representation of a problem that appears in numerous transport systems: $N$ servers distributed over a given space (e.g., cars on an urban network), receive random requests from arriving users who get assigned to the closest server, after which this server is replaced by a new one at a random location. We show that this creates a negative feedback loop, which we call \textit{Increasing Gap Dynamics} (IGD): when a server is assigned a spatial gap forms, which is more likely to attract new users that further widen the gap. The simplest version of our model is a one-dimensional circle, for which we derive analytical results showing that the system converges to an inefficient equilibrium, worse than both balanced and fully random distributions of servers. We prove that an optimal assignment policy always matches the user to one of its two neighbouring servers so that long gaps tend to widen. Hence, the IGD persists even when assigning optimally rather than greedily. In two dimensions, the appearance of the IGD is illustrated through simulations on a square region. Finally, simulations of a proper ride-hailing system using real data from Manhattan confirms that the IGD arises and that it is responsible for the appearance of the well-known Wild Goose Chase.

Abstract: Feedback optimization refers to a class of methods that steer a control system to a steady state that solves an optimization problem. Despite tremendous progress on the topic, an important problem remains open: enforcing state constraints at all times. The difficulty in addressing it lies on mediating between the safety enforcement and the closed-loop stability, and ensuring the equivalence between closed-loop equilibria and the optimization problem's critical points. In this work, we present a feedback-optimization method that enforces state constraints at all times employing high-order control-barrier functions. We provide several results on the proposed controller dynamics, including well-posedness, safety guarantees, equivalence between equilibria and critical points, and local and global (in certain convex cases) asymptotic stability of optima. Various simulations illustrate our results.

Abstract: Outer-approximation-based branch-and-bound is a common algorithmic framework for solving MINLPs (mixed-integer nonlinear programs) to global optimality, with branching variable selection critically influencing overall performance. In modern global MINLP solvers, it is unclear whether branching on fractional integer variables should be prioritized over spatial branching on variables, potentially continuous, that show constraint violations, with different solvers following different defaults. We address this question using a data-driven approach. Based on a test set of hundreds of heterogeneous public and industrial MINLP instances, we train linear and random forest regression models to predict the relative speedup of the FICO(R) Xpress Global solver when using a branching rule that always prioritizes variables with violated integralities versus a mixed rule, allowing for early spatial branches.
  We introduce a practical evaluation methodology that measures the effect of the learned model directly in terms of the shifted geometric mean runtime. Using only four features derived from strong branching and the nonlinear structure, our linear regression model achieves an 8-9% reduction in geometric-mean solving time for the Xpress solver, with over 10% improvement on hard instances. We also analyze a random regression forest model. Experiments across solver versions show that a model trained on Xpress 9.6 still yields significant improvements on Xpress 9.8 without retraining.
  Our results demonstrate how regression models can successfully guide the branching-rule selection and improve the performance of a state-of-the-art commercial MINLP solver.

Abstract: It is known that when minimizing smooth Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) functions, momentum algorithms cannot significantly improve the convergence bound of gradient descent, contrasting with the acceleration phenomenon occurring in the strongly convex case. To bridge this gap, the literature has proposed strongly quasar-convex functions as an intermediate non-convex class, for which accelerated bounds have been suggested to persist. We show that this is not true in general: the additional structure of strong quasar-convexity does not suffice to guaranty better worst-case bounds for momentum compared to gradient descent. As an alternative, we study PL functions under an aiming condition that measures how well the descent direction points toward a minimizer. This perspective clarifies the geometric ingredient enabling provable acceleration by momentum when minimizing PL functions.

Abstract: This paper provides a detailed historical account of early debates over wave-function realism, the modern term for the view that the wave function of quantum theory is physically real. As this paper will show, the idea of physical waves associated with particles had its roots in work by Einstein and de Broglie, who both originally thought of these waves as propagating in three-dimensional physical space. De Broglie quickly turned this wave-particle duality into an early pilot-wave theory, on which a particle's associated phase wave piloted or guided the particle along its trajectory. Schrödinger built on de Broglie's phase-wave hypothesis to provide a comprehensive account of the nascent quantum theory. However, Schrödinger's new undulatory mechanics came at the cost of replacing de Broglie's phase waves propagating in physical space with a wave function propagating in a system's abstract configuration space. The present work will argue that this move from three-dimensional physical space to a many-dimensional configuration space was a key reason why the founders of quantum theory uniformly abandoned the physical reality of the wave function. This paper will further clarify that de Broglie introduced two distinct pilot-wave theories, and will then argue that it was Bohm's rediscovery of the second of these two pilot-wave theories over two decades later, as well as Bohm's vociferous defense of wave-function realism, that were responsible for resurrecting the idea of an ontological wave function. This idea ended up playing a central role in Everett's development of the many-worlds interpretation.
