They are caused by the\ninteraction between the longitudinal dynamics, governed by the tesseral\nharmonics of the geopotential, and the orbital precession forced by Earth's\noblateness and lunisolar perturbations. The transitions are extremely sensitive\nto small perturbations, making the long-term evolution unpredictable. Recently,\na Monte Carlo analysis of trajectories starting in the immediate vicinity of\nthe 165 degrees E unstable equilibrium point, revealed that the evolution to\nchaos is not gradual. It occurs via sudden episodes of disorder at specific\npoints of the precession cycle, when the orbital inclination is minimal. Due to\nthe high cost of the statistical analysis, the results were limited to a single\ninitial longitude. This paper applies modified versions of the diameter\nLagrangian descriptor to reduce the computational burden. This enables mapping\nthe dynamical behavior over the complete range of longitudes where transitions\nbetween modes of motion are possible, considering both unstable equilibrium\npoints (165 degrees E and 15 degrees W). It is found that the episodes of chaos\nremain linked to the orbital inclination cycle, but their timing depends on the\ninitial spacecraft longitude. As the initial position moves farther away from\nthe unstable point, the transitions take place at higher values of the orbital\ninclination. The longitudes where the transitions occur at maximum inclination\ncorrespond to the boundaries of the chaotic region."}

The increase of\nrenewables has made significant impacts both on central electricity markets and\ndistribution-level grids as renewable power generation is often connected to\nthe latter. These stochastic renewable technologies have both advantages and\ndisadvantages. On one hand they offer very low marginal cost and carbon\nemissions, while on the other hand, their output is uncertain, requiring\nflexible backup power with high marginal cost. Flexibility from end-prosumers\nor smaller market participants is therefore seen as a key enabler of\nlarge-scale integration of renewables. However, current central electricity\nmarkets do not directly include uncertainty into the market clearing and do not\naccount for physical constraints of distribution grids.

We derive explicit relations linking the Lyapunov\nexponent and the tail index to the statistics of the condition number,\n$\\gamma\\!\\sim\\!\\gamma_0+\\ln\\kappa$ and\n$\\alpha\\!\\sim\\!-2\\gamma/\\sigma_\\kappa^2$, confirmed by numerical simulations.\nThis framework offers a unifying geometric perspective that help interpret\ndiverse phenomena, including polymer stretching in turbulence, magnetic field\namplification in dynamos, volatility clustering and wealth inequality in\nfinancial systems. Non-normal interactions provide a collective route to\nscale-free behavior in globally stable systems, defining a new universality\nclass where multiplicative feedback and transient amplification generate\ncritical-like statistics without spectral criticality."}

The increase of\nrenewables has made significant impacts both on central electricity markets and\ndistribution-level grids as renewable power generation is often connected to\nthe latter. These stochastic renewable technologies have both advantages and\ndisadvantages. On one hand they offer very low marginal cost and carbon\nemissions, while on the other hand, their output is uncertain, requiring\nflexible backup power with high marginal cost. Flexibility from end-prosumers\nor smaller market participants is therefore seen as a key enabler of\nlarge-scale integration of renewables. However, current central electricity\nmarkets do not directly include uncertainty into the market clearing and do not\naccount for physical constraints of distribution grids. In this paper we\npropose a local electricity market framework based on probabilistic locational\nmarginal pricing, effectively accounting for uncertainties in production,\nconsumption and grid variables. The model includes a representation of the grid\nusing the lindistflow equations and accounts for the propagation of uncertainty\nusing general Polynomial Chaos (gPC). A two-stage convex model is proposed; in\nthe day-ahead stage, probability distributions of prices are calculated for\nevery timestep, where the expected values represent the day-ahead (spot)\nprices. In the real-time stage, uncertainties are realized (measured) and a\ntrivial calculation reveals the real-time price. Through four instructive\ncase-studies we highlight the effectiveness of the method to incentivize\nend-prosumers' participation in the market, while ensuring that their behavior\ndoes not have an adverse impact on the operation of the grid."}

Traffic conflict indicators such as\ntime-to-collision (TTC) provide continuous measures of collision proximity but\nrequire thresholds to distinguish routine from safety-critical interactions.\nExtreme Value Theory (EVT) offers statistically defined thresholds, yet these\ndo not necessarily represent how drivers perceive and respond to conflict. This\nstudy introduces a behavioural modelling framework that identifies candidate\nbehavioural thresholds (CBTs) by explicitly modelling how drivers adjust their\nmovements under conflict conditions. The framework is based on a Latent Class\nLogit Kernel (LC-LK) model that captures inter-class heterogeneity (routine vs.\ndefensive driving) and intra-class correlation between overlapping spatial\nalternatives. This yields probability curves showing how the likelihood of\ndefensive manoeuvres varies with conflict indicators, from which CBTs such as\ninflection points and crossovers can be extracted. The framework tests four\nhypotheses: (1) drivers exhibit varying degrees of membership in both low- and\nhigh-risk classes; (2) membership shifts systematically with conflict values,\nrevealing behavioural thresholds; (3) this relationship follows a logistic\nshape, with stable behaviour at safe levels and rapid transitions near critical\npoints; and (4) even in free flow, drivers maintain a baseline caution level.\nApplication to naturalistic roundabout trajectories revealed stable TTC\nthresholds (0.8-1.1 s) but unstable MTTC2 estimates (e.g., 34 s), suggesting\ncognitive limits in processing complex indicators.

Our results reveal temporal\nstability in aggregate route choice behavior across the entire urban region\nthroughout 2023. Also, we found heterogeneity dependent on the origin and\ndestination (OD) pair. This variation is reflected as a bimodal split in the\nestimated route parameters, indicating that for certain attributes, commuters\nfall into two distinct groups with contrasting preference signs. We believe\nthat our findings serve a basis for future urban route choice modeling by\nsuggesting the importance of elabolating the model of transfer in railway."}

The observed consensus is rare-only 11.5% of notes reach\nagreement on publication, while 69% of posts receive conflicting\nclassifications. A majority of noted posts (approximately 68%) are annotated as\n\"Note Not Needed\", reflecting the repurposing of the platform for debate rather\nthan moderation. We found that such posts are paradoxically more likely to\nyield published notes (OR = 3.12). Temporal analyses show that the notes, on\naverage, are published 65.7 hours after the original post, with longer delays\nsignificantly reducing the likelihood of consensus. These results portray\nCommunity Notes as a stratified, deliberative system dominated by a small\ncontributor elite, marked by persistent dissensus, and constrained by\ntimeliness. We conclude this study by outlining design strategies to promote\nequity, faster consensus, and epistemic reliability in community-based\nmoderation."}

This paper revisits the\n$\\alpha$--regression framework, which uses a flexible power transformation\nparameterized by $\\alpha$ to interpolate between raw data analysis and\nlog-ratio methods, naturally handling zeros without imputation while allowing\ndata-driven transformation selection. We formulate $\\alpha$--regression as a\nnon-linear least squares problem, provide efficient estimation via the\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm with explicit gradient and Hessian derivations,\nestablish asymptotic normality of the estimators, and derive marginal effects\nfor interpretation. The framework is extended to spatial settings through two\nmodels: the $\\alpha$--spatially lagged X regression model, which incorporates\nspatial spillover effects via spatially lagged covariates with decomposition\ninto direct and indirect effects, and the geographically weighted\n$\\alpha$--regression, which allows coefficients to vary spatially for capturing\nlocal relationships. Application to Greek agricultural land-use data\ndemonstrates that spatial extensions substantially improve predictive\nperformance."}

For the path-based case, we use\ncycles on the graph expansion of the operational lines as variables and,\ntherefore, include more of the problem inherent structure into the model. A\nconsequence is the validity of several known inequalities and a lower bound on\nthe LP-relaxation, that is the best known to date.

The proposed models have an advantage in\nthe linear programming relaxation, on the one hand, but have an increased\nproblem size, on the other hand. We define the corresponding pricing problems\nfor the use of column generation to handle the size. Both models are\npractically tested on different problem instances."}
