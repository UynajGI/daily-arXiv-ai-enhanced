In this work, I present a general mechanism, motivated by meson dominance and implemented through the variational method, that identifies which excited states are enhanced by the choice of inserted current and kinematics. The argument is supported by numerical evidence and predictions from chiral perturbation theory across different hadronic channels, in particular in the nucleon sector, and provides both conceptual insight and practical guidance for controlling excited-state effects in hadron three-point function analyses."}

The approach automatically incorporates two-body $DD^*$ and three-body $DDπ$ effects and treats left-hand cuts due to single $π$ exchanges. Two CLS ensembles, X252 and X253, with pion mass $M_π\\approx 280$ MeV, are used, and an operator set comprised of two- and three-hadron and tetraquark operators is employed to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis, in the form of amplitudes for the $I=1$ $DD$ and $I=1/2$ $Dπ$ two-body subsystems.

However, systematic evaluation has remained challenging due to the absence of publicly available, task-specific datasets and standardized performance metrics. We present BEMEval, a benchmark framework designed to assess foundation models' performance across BEM tasks. The first benchmark in this suite, BEMEval-Doc2Schema, focuses on structured data extraction from building documentation, a foundational step toward automated BEM processes. BEMEval-Doc2Schema introduces the Key-Value Overlap Rate (KVOR), a metric that quantifies the alignment between LLM-generated structured outputs and ground-truth schema references. Using this framework, we evaluate two leading models (GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5) under zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies across three datasets: HERS L100, NREL iUnit, and NIST NZERTF. Results show that Gemini 2.5 consistently outperforms GPT-5, and that few-shot prompts improve accuracy for both models. Performance also varies by schema: the EPC schema yields significantly higher KVOR scores than HPXML, reflecting its simpler and reduced hierarchical depth. By combining curated datasets, reproducible metrics, and cross-model comparisons, BEMEval-Doc2Schema establishes the first community-driven benchmark for evaluating LLMs in performing building energy modeling tasks, laying the groundwork for future research on AI-assisted BEM workflows."}

The proposed approach is based on a nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) that satisfies the summation-by-parts (SBP) property. At the semidiscrete level, entropy stability is established through the SBP structure and the discrete metric identities associated with curvilinear coordinate mappings. By incorporating entropy-stable numerical fluxes at element interfaces, a global discrete entropy inequality is obtained. To further control nonphysical oscillations near strong discontinuities, the entropy-stable DG formulation is combined with a modified oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) method, which was originally proposed in [59]. We observe that the zero-order damping coefficient in the original OEDG method naturally serves as an effective shock indicator, which enables localization of the oscillation control mechanism and significantly reduces computational cost. Moreover, while the original OEDG formulation relies on local orthogonal modal bases and is primarily restricted to simplicial meshes, we reformulate the OE procedure using projection operators, allowing for a systematic extension to general curvilinear meshes. The resulting method preserves conservation and entropy stability while effectively suppressing spurious oscillations. A series of challenging numerical experiments is presented to demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed entropy-stable OEDG method on both Cartesian and curvilinear meshes."}

The exact energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of the Dunkl number coherent states. Furthermore, we compute the Mandel $Q$ parameter and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ to analyze the statistical properties of the Dunkl squeezed states. We show that, for the squeezed vacuum, the Mandel parameter remains independent of the Dunkl deformation, whereas the correlation function exhibits an explicit dependence on the Dunkl parameter $μ$, which modifies the photon bunching effects. Finally, we show that our results reduce to the standard parametric amplifier case in the limit of vanishing Dunkl deformation parameter."}

A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes.

The question naturally arises if the two tests substantially differ and, if so, which of them is better in which data situation. In large samples, both tests are similar: they are asymptotically equivalent under the null hypothesis and under sequences of local alternatives. In small samples, there may be quite noticeable differences, which is in line with a different asymptotic behavior under fixed alternatives. We derive a simple criterion for deciding which test is more powerful. We examine the examples Gini's mean difference, the sample variance, and Kendall's tau in detail. Particularly, when testing for changes in scale by Gini's mean difference, we show that the first-vs-full approach has a higher power if and only if the scale changes from a smaller to a larger value -- regardless of the population distribution or the location of the change. The asymptotic derivations are under weak dependence. The results are illustrated by numerical simulations and data examples."}

This stands in contrast to a common claim in the recent literature on \"higher-order networks\" that graph-based representations are fundamentally limited to \"pairwise\" interactions, requiring hypergraph formulations to capture richer dependencies. We clarify this issue by emphasizing two frequently overlooked facts. First, graph-based models are not restricted to pairwise interactions, as they naturally accommodate interactions that depend simultaneously on multiple adjacent nodes. Second, hypergraph formulations are strict special cases of more general graph-based representations, as they impose additional constraints on the allowable interactions between adjacent elements rather than expanding the space of possibilities. We show that key phenomenology commonly attributed to hypergraphs -- such as abrupt transitions -- can, in general, be recovered exactly using graph models, even locally tree-like ones, and thus do not constitute a class of phenomena that is inherently contingent on hypergraphs models. Finally, we argue that the broad relevance of hypergraphs for applications that is sometimes claimed in the literature is not supported by evidence. Instead it is likely grounded in misconceptions that network models cannot accommodate multibody interactions or that certain phenomena can only be captured with hypergraphs. We argue that clearly distinguishing between multivariate interactions, parametrized by graphs, and the functions that define them enables a more unified and flexible foundation for modeling interacting systems."}

While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of \"distilled\" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.\n  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model \"superclusters\", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts."}

Here, we quantify the impact of Greenland meltwater on the AMOC until 2100 under SSP5-8.5 forcing for the first time in a strongly eddying (1/10° horizontal resolution) ocean model. The meltwater-induced additional AMOC weakening is small (0.6 $\\pm$ 0.2 Sv) compared to the weakening due to warming alone, and similar at high and low resolution.

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation."}

There, the transformer architecture, which has been highly successful in language and vision applications, allows us to account for the fact that the most recently observed time points in an individual's history may not always be the most important for the immediate future. This is achieved by assigning attention weights to observations of an individual based on a transformation of their values. One reason why these ideas have not yet been fully leveraged for longitudinal cohort data is that typically, large datasets are required. Therefore, we present a simplified transformer architecture that retains the core attention mechanism while reducing the number of parameters to be estimated, to be more suitable for small datasets with few time points. Guided by a statistical perspective on transformers, we use an autoregressive model as a starting point and incorporate attention as a kernel-based operation with temporal decay, where aggregation of multiple transformer heads, i.e. different candidate weighting schemes, is expressed as accumulating evidence on different types of underlying characteristics of individuals. This also enables a permutation-based statistical testing procedure for identifying contextual patterns. In a simulation study, the approach is shown to recover contextual dependencies even with a small number of individuals and time points. In an application to data from a resilience study, we identify temporal patterns in the dynamics of stress and mental health. This indicates that properly adapted transformers can not only achieve competitive predictive performance, but also uncover complex context dependencies in small data settings."}

Although SD has been empirically shown to often improve generalization, its formal guarantees remain limited. We study SD for ridge regression in unconstrained setting in which the mixing weight $ξ$ may be outside the unit interval. Conditioned on the training data and without any distributional assumptions, we prove that for any squared prediction risk (including out-of-distribution), the optimally mixed student strictly improves upon the ridge teacher for every regularization level $λ> 0$ at which the teacher ridge risk $R(λ)$ is nonstationary (i.e., $R'(λ) \\neq 0$). We obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal mixing weight $ξ^\\star(λ)$ for any value of $λ$ and show that it obeys the sign rule: $\\operatorname{sign}(ξ^\\star(λ))=-\\operatorname{sign}(R'(λ))$. In particular, $ξ^\\star(λ)$ can be negative, which is the case in over-regularized regimes. To quantify the risk improvement due to SD, we derive exact deterministic equivalents for the optimal SD risk in the proportional asymptotics regime (where the sample and feature sizes $n$ and $p$ both diverge but their aspect ratio $p/n$ converges) under general anisotropic covariance and deterministic signals. Our asymptotic analysis extends standard second-order ridge deterministic equivalents to their fourth-order analogs using block linearization, which may be of independent interest.

We establish sharp spectral characterizations: stability holds if and only if all eigenvalues of the pseudo-gradient matrix $G$ lie in $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$, with the convergence direction additionally requiring diagonalizability of $G$. Remarkably, complex eigenvalues with positive real parts, which ensure stability for first-order gradient dynamics, induce exponential instability in NAGD.

We address this gap with a benchmark that computes energies and forces directly from predicted Hamiltonians.

The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated. We find it to be strongly anisotropic and very sensitive to the magnon lifetime."}

This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias."}

Topic modeling approaches are often used for analyzing and making sense of social media discussions consisting of millions of short text messages.

In this paper, we introduce Narrative Topic Labels derived with Retrieval Augmented Generation (NTLRAG), a scalable and extensible framework that generates semantically precise and human-interpretable narrative topic labels. Our narrative topic labels provide a context-rich, intuitive concept to describe topic model output. In particular, NTLRAG uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques and considers multiple retrieval strategies as well as chain-of-thought elements to provide high-quality output. NTLRAG can be combined with any standard topic model to generate, validate, and refine narratives which then serve as narrative topic labels. We evaluated NTLRAG with a user study and three real-world datasets consisting of more than 6.7 million social media messages that have been sent by more than 2.7 million users.

While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of \"distilled\" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.\n  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model \"superclusters\", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts."}

Unlike most existing studies that approximate the expected SE by substituting the random channel gain with its mean value, thereby evaluating the SE at the average channel realization and overestimating the true expected SE due to Jensen's inequality, we approximate the expected SE by numerically integrating the SE over the channel distributions. Specifically, instead of relying on average-channel-based approximations, we develop a conservative yet tractable quadrature-based approximation by discretizing the associated cumulative distribution functions. The resulting finite-sum representation explicitly accounts for the probabilistic LoS structure and channel fading effects, while remaining tractable for optimization. Leveraging this lower bound, we formulate a mission completion time minimization problem subject to minimum expected-SE requirements for all ground nodes. The resulting problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization, which is tackled via a penalty-based block coordinate descent framework. The proposed algorithm alternately optimizes the scheduling decisions and the UAV trajectory along with adaptive time-slot durations, and maintains feasibility with respect to the original expected-SE constraints by leveraging successive convex approximation and quadratic transform techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method strictly satisfies the minimum expected-SE constraints and achieves a significantly shorter mission completion time than conventional average-channel-based approaches, which are shown to yield infeasible or overly conservative solutions."}

Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing."}

Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability.

We establish asymptotic linearity and normality and propose asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We also develop an approximately greedy sampling strategy that improves efficiency relative to uniform sampling.

While physical aggression is prototypical, contemporary societies increasingly debate whether exclusion, humiliation, online harassment or symbolic acts should be classified within the same moral category. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) are being consulted in everyday contexts to interpret and label complex social behaviors. Whether these systems reproduce, reshape or simplify human conceptions of violence remains an open question. Methods: Here we present a systematic comparison between human judgements and LLM classifications across 22 scenarios carefully designed to be morally dividing, spanning from physical and verbally aggressive behavior, relational dynamics, marginalization, symbolic actions and verbal expressions. Human responses were compared with outputs from multiple instruction-tuned models of varying sizes and architectures. We conducted global, sentence-level and thematic-domain analyses, and examined variability across models to assess patterns of convergence and divergence. Findings: This study treats violence as a strategically chosen proxy through which broader belief formation dynamics can be observed. Violence is not the focus of the study, but it serves as a tool to investigate broader analysis. It enables a structured investigation of how LLMs operationalize ambiguous moral constructs, negotiate conceptual boundaries, and transform plural human interpretations into singular outputs. More broadly, the findings contribute to ongoing debates about the epistemic role of conversational AI in shaping everyday interpretations of harm, responsibility and social norms, highlighting the importance of transparency and critical engagement as these systems increasingly mediate public reasoning."}

Unlike most existing studies that approximate the expected SE by substituting the random channel gain with its mean value, thereby evaluating the SE at the average channel realization and overestimating the true expected SE due to Jensen's inequality, we approximate the expected SE by numerically integrating the SE over the channel distributions. Specifically, instead of relying on average-channel-based approximations, we develop a conservative yet tractable quadrature-based approximation by discretizing the associated cumulative distribution functions. The resulting finite-sum representation explicitly accounts for the probabilistic LoS structure and channel fading effects, while remaining tractable for optimization. Leveraging this lower bound, we formulate a mission completion time minimization problem subject to minimum expected-SE requirements for all ground nodes. The resulting problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization, which is tackled via a penalty-based block coordinate descent framework. The proposed algorithm alternately optimizes the scheduling decisions and the UAV trajectory along with adaptive time-slot durations, and maintains feasibility with respect to the original expected-SE constraints by leveraging successive convex approximation and quadratic transform techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method strictly satisfies the minimum expected-SE constraints and achieves a significantly shorter mission completion time than conventional average-channel-based approaches, which are shown to yield infeasible or overly conservative solutions."}

This stands in contrast to a common claim in the recent literature on \"higher-order networks\" that graph-based representations are fundamentally limited to \"pairwise\" interactions, requiring hypergraph formulations to capture richer dependencies. We clarify this issue by emphasizing two frequently overlooked facts. First, graph-based models are not restricted to pairwise interactions, as they naturally accommodate interactions that depend simultaneously on multiple adjacent nodes. Second, hypergraph formulations are strict special cases of more general graph-based representations, as they impose additional constraints on the allowable interactions between adjacent elements rather than expanding the space of possibilities. We show that key phenomenology commonly attributed to hypergraphs -- such as abrupt transitions -- can, in general, be recovered exactly using graph models, even locally tree-like ones, and thus do not constitute a class of phenomena that is inherently contingent on hypergraphs models. Finally, we argue that the broad relevance of hypergraphs for applications that is sometimes claimed in the literature is not supported by evidence. Instead it is likely grounded in misconceptions that network models cannot accommodate multibody interactions or that certain phenomena can only be captured with hypergraphs. We argue that clearly distinguishing between multivariate interactions, parametrized by graphs, and the functions that define them enables a more unified and flexible foundation for modeling interacting systems."}

Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \\approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \\approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system.

We see that the $\\check{R}$-matrix, that appears in the baxterization approach to integrability, transforms in a simple manner. We further show for a broad class of MPOs that the usual Yang--Baxter $R$-matrix satisfies a modified algebra, previously identified in the unitary case, that gives a local integrable structure underlying the commuting transfer matrices of the dual model. We illustrate these results with two case studies, analysing an invertible unitary MPO and a non-invertible MPO both applied to the canonical XXZ spin chain.

Using similarity transformations, we determine the conditions yielding real energy spectra and skin effect, and identify the emergence of exceptional points where spectra transition from real to complex. We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges.

First, this method reconstructs system's high-dimensional state using data assimilation from limited and noisy observations.

Third, we capture underlying changes in the system by splitting the reconstructed timeseries into sliding windows and analyzing the changes in the temporally local attractor's structural complexity. The structural information is provided as graph Laplacian and measured by Von Neumann entropy in this framework.

The question naturally arises if the two tests substantially differ and, if so, which of them is better in which data situation. In large samples, both tests are similar: they are asymptotically equivalent under the null hypothesis and under sequences of local alternatives. In small samples, there may be quite noticeable differences, which is in line with a different asymptotic behavior under fixed alternatives. We derive a simple criterion for deciding which test is more powerful. We examine the examples Gini's mean difference, the sample variance, and Kendall's tau in detail. Particularly, when testing for changes in scale by Gini's mean difference, we show that the first-vs-full approach has a higher power if and only if the scale changes from a smaller to a larger value -- regardless of the population distribution or the location of the change.

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems.

These beams are then translated across the object to bring different regions of interest into focus. The Fourier diffraction relation adapted to this setting differs in one crucial point from the plane-wave case: while certain Fourier coefficients of the measurements still directly correspond to individual Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential, others are given by linear combinations of two Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential.\n  This article investigates which Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential can be uniquely recovered from these relations.

We distinguish conditional and marginal treatment effect estimands and show how transportability depends on effect modification, collapsibility, and alignment between the scale of effect modification and the effect measure. Using illustrative examples, we demonstrate that even when effect modifiers are shared across treatments, marginal effects are generally population-dependent for commonly used non-collapsible measures, including hazard ratios and odds ratios. Conversely, collapsible and conditional effects defined on the linear predictor scale exhibit more favorable transportability properties. We further show that pairwise PAIC approaches typically identify effects defined in the comparator population and that applying these estimates to other populations entails an additional, often implicit, transport step requiring further assumptions. This has direct implications for HTA, where PAIC-derived effects are routinely applied within cost-effectiveness and decision models defined for different target populations. Our results clarify when applying PAIC-derived treatment effects to desired target populations is justified, when doing so requires additional assumptions, and when results should instead be interpreted as population-specific rather than decision-relevant, supporting more transparent and principled use of indirect evidence in HTA and related decision-making contexts."}

Adaptively collecting the expensive measurements can increase efficiency but complicates statistical inference. We give valid estimators and confidence intervals for M-estimation under adaptive two-phase multiwave sampling. We focus on the case where proxies for the expensive variables -- such as predictions from pretrained machine learning models -- are available for all units and propose a Multiwave Predict-Then-Debias estimator that combines proxy information with the expensive, higher-quality measurements to improve efficiency while removing bias. We establish asymptotic linearity and normality and propose asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We also develop an approximately greedy sampling strategy that improves efficiency relative to uniform sampling. Data-based simulation studies support the theoretical results and demonstrate efficiency gains."}

Nonetheless, this premise can be a severe oversimplification in the presence of market competitors, as customers may prefer facilities installed by one of them. The monopolistic assumption can particularly worsen planning performance when demand depends on prior location decisions of the market participants, namely, when unmet demand from one period carries over to the next. Such a demand behaviour creates an intrinsic relationship between customer demand and location decisions of all market participants, and requires the decision-maker to anticipate the competitor's response. This work studies a novel competitive facility location problem that combines cumulative demand and market competition to devise high-quality solutions. We propose bilevel mixed-integer programming formulations for two variants of our problem, prove that the optimistic variant is $Σ^{p}_{2}$-hard, and develop branch-and-cut algorithms with tightened value-function cuts that significantly outperform general-purpose bilevel solvers. Our results quantify the severe cost of planning under a monopolistic assumption (profit drops by half on average) and the gains from cooperation over competition (6% more joint profit), while drawing managerial guidelines on how instance attributes and duopolistic modelling choices shape robust location schedules."}

This stands in contrast to a common claim in the recent literature on \"higher-order networks\" that graph-based representations are fundamentally limited to \"pairwise\" interactions, requiring hypergraph formulations to capture richer dependencies. We clarify this issue by emphasizing two frequently overlooked facts. First, graph-based models are not restricted to pairwise interactions, as they naturally accommodate interactions that depend simultaneously on multiple adjacent nodes. Second, hypergraph formulations are strict special cases of more general graph-based representations, as they impose additional constraints on the allowable interactions between adjacent elements rather than expanding the space of possibilities. We show that key phenomenology commonly attributed to hypergraphs -- such as abrupt transitions -- can, in general, be recovered exactly using graph models, even locally tree-like ones, and thus do not constitute a class of phenomena that is inherently contingent on hypergraphs models. Finally, we argue that the broad relevance of hypergraphs for applications that is sometimes claimed in the literature is not supported by evidence. Instead it is likely grounded in misconceptions that network models cannot accommodate multibody interactions or that certain phenomena can only be captured with hypergraphs. We argue that clearly distinguishing between multivariate interactions, parametrized by graphs, and the functions that define them enables a more unified and flexible foundation for modeling interacting systems."}

Such measurement setups, combining focused illumination with scanning, have not yet been incorporated into the diffraction tomography framework. To bridge this gap, we extend diffraction tomography by modeling incident fields as Herglotz waves, thereby incorporating focused beams into the theory. Within this setting, we derive a new Fourier diffraction relation, which forms the basis for quantitative tomographic reconstruction from scanning data.

A Gradient Variance Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "Based on our experimental findings, we propose the following decision framework for practitioners. Quantum annealing is recommended when the problem formulation QUBO exhibits a high gradient variance (greater than 0.3) and the energy landscape contains numerous thin barriers characterized by sharp peaks and narrow valleys. Additionally, quantum approaches are particularly suitable when classical methods are observed to get trapped in local minima, the problem size is manageable given hardware constraints (less than 5000 variables for pure quantum annealing), and the time overhead of approximately 10 seconds is acceptable for the application.\n  In contrast, classical methods are recommended when the gradient variance is low (less than 0.2), indicating smooth landscapes where quantum tunneling provides little advantage. Classical approaches are also preferable when the problem size is small and classical solvers can provide nearly instantaneous results, when solution quality requirements are modest and local optima suffice, or when hardware access or cost is a limiting factor.\n  For problems that exceed pure quantum capacity but possess a favorable landscape structure, hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical techniques are recommended. Such hybrid methods are particularly effective when decomposition quality can be verified and both solution quality and scalability are important considerations."}

The parametric ones are sometimes too biased while the nonparametric ones are sometimes too variable. In the present paper a certain semiparametric approach to hazard rate estimation, proposed in Hjort (1991), is developed further, aiming to combine parametric and nonparametric features. It uses a dynamic local likelihood approach to fit the locally most suitable member in a given parametric class of hazard rates, and amounts to a version of nonparametric parameter smoothing within the parametric class. Thus the parametric hazard rate estimate at time $s$ inserts a parameter estimate that also depends on $s$. We study bias and variance properties of the resulting estimator and methods for choosing the local smoothing parameter. It is shown that dynamic likelihood estimation often leads to better performance than the purely nonparametric methods, while also having capacity for not losing much to the parametric methods in cases where the model being smoothed is adequate."}

In particular, recent encoder-based methods with artificial neural network state-space (ANN-SS) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, using computationally efficient methods and offering consistent model estimation in the presence of noisy data. However, inclusion of prior knowledge of the system can be further exploited to increase (i) estimation speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) interpretability of the resulting models. This paper proposes a model augmentation method that incorporates prior knowledge from first-principles (FP) models in a flexible manner.

Although effective in practice, its mathematical structure and potential for parallelization have remained unexplored. In this work, we establish a rigorous functional-analytic foundation for the TV-Stokes model. We formulate both steps in appropriate infinite-dimensional function spaces, derive their dual formulations, and analyze the compatibility and mathematical consistency of the coupled system. In particular, we identify analytical inconsistencies in the original formulation and demonstrate how an alternative model resolves them. We also examine the orthogonal projection onto the divergence-free subspace, proving its existence in a continuous setting and establishing consistency with its discrete counterpart.\n  Building on this theoretical framework, we develop the first domain decomposition method for TV-Stokes by applying overlapping Schwarz-type iterations to the duals of both steps. Although the divergence-free constraint gives rise to a global projection operator in the continuous model, we show that it becomes locally computable in the discrete setting. This insight enables a fully parallelizable algorithm suitable for large-scale image processing in memory-constrained environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate the correctness of the domain decomposition approach and its usability in parallel image reconstruction."}

By comparing Johnson-Nyquist noise generated by Joule and microwave heating, measured through the amplification chain, the attenuation of the input line, and hence the gain of the chain, is determined without requiring knowledge of the attenuator temperature.

However, when dealing with optimal control problems of stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs) with completely monotone kernels, deep mathematical difficulties arise and it is still not understood. These very classical problems have applications in most fields and have now become even more popular due to their applications in mathematical finance under rough volatility. In this article, we consider a class of optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. Via a recent Markovian lift \\cite{FGW2024}, the problem can be reformulated as an optimal control problem of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on suitable Hilbert spaces, which due to the roughness of the kernel, presents a generator of an analytic semigroup and unbounded control and diffusion operators.\n  This analysis leads us to study a general class of optimal control problems of abstract SDEs on Hilbert spaces with unbounded control and diffusion operators. This class includes optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels, but it is also motivated by other models. We analyze the regularity of the associated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transition semigroup. We prove that the semigroup exhibits a new smoothing property in control directions through a general observation operator $Γ$, which we call $Γ$-smoothing. This allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, establish a verification theorem, and construct optimal feedback controls. We apply these results to optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. To the best of our knowledge these are the first results of this kind for this abstract class of infinite dimensional problems and for the optimal control of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels."}

This relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing and no more. Here we develop an axiomatisation of quantum computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimisation, including brute force computer search, to optimise quantum computations. The free model may be interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model, but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning."}

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation."}

Current QEC controllers execute all scheduled syndrome (parity-bit) measurement rounds before decoding, even when early syndrome data indicates that the run will result in an error. The resulting excess measurements increase the decoder's workload and system latency. To address this, we introduce an adaptive abort module that simultaneously reduces decoder overhead and suppresses logical error rates in surface codes and color codes under an existing QEC controller. The key idea is that initial syndrome information allows the controller to terminate risky shots early before additional resources are spent. An effective scheme balances the cost of further measurement against the restart cost and thus increases decoder efficiency.\n  Adaptive abort schemes dynamically adjust the number of syndrome measurement rounds per shot using real-time syndrome information. We consider three schemes: fixed-depth (FD) decoding (the standard non-adaptive approach used in current state-of-the-art QEC controllers), and two adaptive schemes, AdAbort and One-Step Lookahead (OSLA) decoding. For surface and color codes under a realistic circuit-level depolarizing noise model, AdAbort substantially outperforms both OSLA and FD, yielding higher decoder efficiency across a broad range of code distances. Numerically, as the code distance increases from 5 to 15, AdAbort yields an improvement that increases from 5% to 35% for surface codes and from 7% to 60% for color codes.\n  To our knowledge, these are the first adaptive abort schemes considered for QEC. Our results highlight the potential importance of abort rules for increasing efficiency as we scale to large, resource-intensive quantum architectures."}

In single-molecule localisation microscopy, this problem is particularly acute as fluorescent molecules used to tag protein oligomers display heterogenous photophysical behaviour that can complicate photobleach step analysis; a key step in resolving nanoscale protein organisation. Existing methods often require extensive filtering or prior calibration, and can fail to accurately account for blinking or reversible dark states that may contaminate downstream analysis. In this paper, an extension to RJMCMC is proposed for change point detection with heterogeneous temporal dynamics. This approach is applied to the problem of estimating per-frame active fluorophore counts from one-dimensional integrated intensity traces derived from Fluorescence Localisation Imaging with Photobleaching (FLImP), where compound change point pair moves are introduced to better account for short-lived events known as blinking and dark states. The approach is validated using simulated and experimental data, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness when compared with current photobleach step analysis methods and with the existing analysis approach for FLImP data. This Compound RJMCMC (CRJMCMC) algorithm performs reliably across a wide range of fluorophore counts and signal-to-noise conditions, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) down to 0.001 and counts as high as seventeen fluorophores, while also effectively estimating low counts observed when studying EGFR oligomerisation. Beyond single molecule imaging, this work has applications for a variety of time series change point detection problems with heterogeneous state persistence. For example, electrocorticography brain-state segmentation, fault detection in industrial process monitoring and realised volatility in financial time series."}

Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing."}

This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias."}

Building on a recent double-slit interferometry experiment with real weak values [Phys. Rev.

We demonstrate that the Allan-variance noise floor scales with the inverse of the detected photon number $1/N_r$, confirming shot-noise-limited operation with WVA. Furthermore, this $1/N_r$ scaling experimentally validates that WVA can outperform conventional measurement under fixed detected photon number and detector saturation, in the presence of technical noise, as theoretically predicted [Phys.

The method assumes the motion is a stationary random process over an image exposure interval. Displacement, smear, and jitter covariances are computed from the solution to a Lyapunov differential equation. These covariances parameterize statistical image motion modulation transfer functions (MTFs), and they can be used to verify pointing and image motion MTF requirements. The method in the present paper extends a previous method to include smear, as well as displacement, and hence jitter. The approach in the present paper also leads, as a special case, to a more efficient method to compute the displacement covariance than the previous method. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed method."}

One of the key performance metrics in quantum information theory, namely the Holevo bound, quantifies the amount of classical information that can be transmitted reliably over a quantum channel. However, computing and optimizing the Holevo bound remains a challenging task due to its dependence on both the quantum input ensemble and the quantum channel. In order to maximize the Holevo bound, we propose a unified projected gradient ascent algorithm to optimize the quantum channel given a fixed input ensemble. We provide a detailed complexity analysis for the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantum channel optimization yields higher Holevo bounds than input ensemble optimization."}

In particular, we show that by quenching the magnetic field strength from the symmetric phase to the broken phase, we can achieve a significant enhancement in stored energy, as well as stable and efficient ergotropy extraction.

Strain engineering of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) enables the tuning of light-matter interactions and associated optoelectronic properties, and generates new functionalities, including the formation of quantum dots (QDs). Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($μ$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device.

The game structures corresponding to generic experiments such as fixed-causal-order process matrices or causal contextuality scenarios, together with a deterministic non-Nashian resolution algorithm that abandons unilateral deviation assumptions (free choice) and assumes Perfect Prediction instead, were described in previous work.\n  In this new research, we learn the reward functions of the game, which contain a hidden variable, using neural networks.

The obstruction is intrinsic: with finite sampling, normalization becomes a statistical bottleneck, and support mismatch between numerator and denominator estimators can render the empirical objective ill-conditioned and even sub-variational. Moreover, to reproduce the ground state with constant-depth ansatzes or with linear-depth circuits forming unitary 2-designs, the required reweighting range (and hence the sampling cost) grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Motivated by this no-go result, we develop a normalization-free alternative, the unitary variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (U-VQNHE).

We show that the Krylov bounds converge to the QFI exponentially fast with increasing order and can surpass the state-of-the-art polynomial lower bounds known to date. Moreover, we show that certain low-order Krylov bound can already match the QFI exactly for low-rank states prevalent in practical settings.

The probability curves obtained from the two methods completely overlap before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, a slight difference appears, but this difference does not amplify with evolution and tends to converge in the later stage. Method B yields a slightly higher dissipative-state probability, indicating that the photon escapes faster. Visualization of the two-dimensional probability distribution shows that the three scenarios (closed system, open system with Method A, and open system with Method B) exhibit identical probability distributions before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, the open systems exhibit significant probability loss, which increases rapidly with evolution. The probability distribution patterns of the two open systems are highly similar, exhibiting synchronized evolution."}

Here, we investigate whether sets of quantum measurements can be modelled by using only devices that are operationally classical, in the sense that they have no superposition properties. This leads us to propose classical measurement models, which we show to be stronger than commutative measurements but weaker than joint measurability. We determine both the exact depolarisation noise rate and the measurement loss rate at which the all projective measurements in $d$-dimensional quantum theory admit a classical model. For finite sets of quantum measurements we develop methods both for constructing classical models and for falsifying the existence of such model via prepare-and-measure setups. Furthermore, we show that this concept also has operational implications. For that, we consider whether quantum measurements with classical side-information can be implemented in sequence without causing a disturbance and we show that classical models imply an affirmative answer. Our work sheds light on superposition as a resource for quantum measurement devices."}

Among existing approaches, variational quantum algorithms and quantum annealing dominate current research; however, both typically rely on one-hot encodings that severely limit scalability. Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) was recently introduced as an alternative paradigm that reduces qubit requirements by embedding problem variables into Pauli correlations. Despite its promise, PCE has not yet been studied in the context of constrained optimization. In this work, we extend the PCE framework to constrained combinatorial optimization problems and evaluate its performance across multiple problem sizes. Our results show that the standard PCE formulation struggles to reliably enforce constraints, which motivates the introduction of the Iterative-$α$ PCE. This iterative strategy significantly improves solution quality, achieving consistent constraint satisfaction while yielding better cut sizes across a wide range of instances. These findings highlight both the limitations of current PCE formulations for constrained problems and the effectiveness of iterative strategies for advancing quantum optimization in the NISQ era."}

Although not a genuine entanglement measure, both TE and OE are connected to the efficiency of matrix product state simulations and thus of fundamental interest. As in many quantum algorithms, at the end of the Grover circuit entanglement decreases as the system converges towards the target product state. While we find that this is well captured in the OE dynamics, quantum trajectories rarely follow paths of reducing entanglement. Optimized unraveling schemes can lower TE slightly, however we show that deep in the circuit OE is generally smaller than TE. This implies that matrix product density operator (MPDO) simulations of quantum circuits can in general be more efficient than quantum trajectories. In addition, we investigate the noise-rate scaling of success probabilities for both amplitude-damping and phase-flip noise in Grover's algorithm."}

We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector. This thus not quite so simple harmonic oscillator provides an explicit realization of our general contention that antilinearity is more basic to quantum theory than Hermiticity."}

Our scheme requires only two-mode squeezing, passive optics, and static homodyne measurements, and enables post-hoc classical estimation of many properties from the same experimental dataset. We prove that our protocol enables a quantum speedup for common classical sensing tasks, including measuring electromagnetic correlations, real-time feedback control of interferometric cavities, and Fourier-domain matched filtering. To establish these separations, we introduce an optimal-transport conditioning method, and show both worst-case exponential separations from all entanglement-free strategies and practical speedups over homodyne and heterodyne baselines. We further show that when squeezing is treated as a resource, a protocol with squeezed light can sense a structured classical background exponentially faster than any coherent classical probe."}

SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates. Together, our empirical scaling laws and rigorous per-iteration guarantees establish SEGQE as a measurement-efficient state-preparation primitive well suited to early fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures."}

This is the case for a canonical problem: estimating the amplitude and frequency of an AC magnetic field, where the generators are parallel to each other. Here, we introduce a quantum control protocol that resolves this singularity. Our control protocol strategically engineers the sensor's time evolution so the generators for the two parameters become orthogonal. It not only removes the singularity but also restores the optimal scaling of precision with interrogation time for both parameters simultaneously. We experimentally validate this protocol using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at room temperature, demonstrating the concurrent achievement of the optimal scaling for both parameters under realistic conditions."}
