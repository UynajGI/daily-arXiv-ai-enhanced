In theory, this\nhierarchy should be observable as clear scale breaks in turbulent kinetic\nenergy spectra as one physical mechanism transitions to the next. Here, we show\nthat this view is not supported by global dropsonde and radiosonde datasets of\nhorizontal winds. Instead, the structure function for horizontal wind\ncalculated for vertical separations between 200 m and 8 km has a Hurst exponent\nof $H_v \\approx 0.6$, which is inconsistent with either gravity waves ($H_v =\n1$) or 3D turbulence ($H_v = 1/3$). For horizontal separations between 200 km\nand 1800 km, the Hurst exponent is $H_h \\approx 0.4$, which is inconsistent\nwith quasi-geostrophic dynamics ($H_h = 1$). We argue that sonde observations\nare most consistent with a lesser known \"Lovejoy-Schertzer\" model for\nstratified turbulence where, at all scales, the dynamics of the atmosphere obey\na single anisotropic turbulent cascade with $H_v=3/5$ and $H_h =1/3$.

To this end, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph\nconvolutional network (ST-GCN) for adaptive prediction of distribution factors\n(DFs), thereby capturing the dynamic influence of individual T-DERs across the\ntransmission system. Furthermore, an iterative constraint identification\nstrategy is incorporated to alleviate transmission security constraints without\ncompromising system reliability.

However,\nthe inherent stochasticity of LLMs, in terms of their tendency to produce\ndifferent outputs for the same input, creates a significant measurement error\nproblem that is often neglected with a single round of output, or addressed\nwith ad-hoc methods like majority voting. Such naive approaches fail to\nquantify uncertainty and can produce biased estimates of population-level\nmetrics. In this paper, we propose a principled solution by reframing LLM\nvariability as a statistical measurement error problem and introducing a\nBayesian latent state model to address it. Our model treats the true\nclassification (e.g., customer dissatisfaction) as an unobserved latent\nvariable and the multiple LLM ratings as noisy measurements of this state. This\nframework allows for the simultaneous estimation of the LLM's false positive\nand false negative error rates, the underlying base rate of the phenomenon in\nthe population, the posterior probability of the true state for each individual\nobservation, and the causal impact of a business intervention, if any, on the\nlatent state. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our model\naccurately recovers true parameters where naive methods fail.

This study proposes to quantify the structural modifications implied\nby the disruption of single elements in a transportation network through the\nGromov-Wasserstein distance. Specifically, we iteratively remove one single\nedge from the original network to simulate a disruptive event and then compute\nthe Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the original network and the disrupted\none. Finally, edges are ranked depending on the observed Gromov-Wasserstein\ndistance: the higher the value of the distance, the more critical the edge is\nin terms. Two transportation networks from Berlin are considered in the\nexperiments, namely Berlin Friedrichshain Center (BFC) and Berlin Tiergarten\n(BT).

The emulator integrates a\nseparately excited DC motor (SEDCM), a four-quadrant DC-DC converter, a battery\nemulator, and a mechanical load emulator. The system models tractive effort,\naerodynamic drag, and gradient resistance using Newton's second law. In\ncontrast to conventional graphical modeling tools (e.g., block diagrams and\nbond graphs), the adopted Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) framework\noffers clear advantages by explicitly representing energy interactions and\nfacilitating the systematic derivation of control structures. A control\nstrategy developed within this framework governs energy flow across the\npowertrain, enabling accurate speed control via armature voltage regulation.\nExperimental tests conducted on a Lucas-Nulle test bench show strong\ncorrelation with simulation results. The study also introduces a methodology to\ncompute the maximum admissible vehicle mass - determined to be 13.5 kg for a\n180 W motor operating at 1900 rpm - based on acceleration and slope\nconstraints. Furthermore, a switching algorithm for the bidirectional converter\nensures reliable four quadrant operation. Overall, the proposed framework\nprovides a scalable and effective approach for EV emulation, control design,\nand energy management validation."}

In particular,\nthe gradient descent (GD) optimization algorithm has been extensively studied\nin recent years. A key assumption about GD has appeared in several recent\nworks: the \\emph{GD map is non-singular} -- it preserves sets of measure zero\nunder preimages. Crucially, this assumption has been used to prove that GD\navoids saddle points and maxima, and to establish the existence of a computable\nquantity that determines the convergence to global minima (both for GD and\nstochastic GD). However, the current literature either assumes the\nnon-singularity of the GD map or imposes restrictive assumptions, such as\nLipschitz smoothness of the loss (for example, Lipschitzness does not hold for\ndeep ReLU networks with the cross-entropy loss) and restricts the analysis to\nGD with small step-sizes. In this paper, we investigate the neural network map\nas a function on the space of weights and biases. We also prove, for the first\ntime, the non-singularity of the gradient descent (GD) map on the loss\nlandscape of realistic neural network architectures (with fully connected,\nconvolutional, or softmax attention layers) and piecewise analytic activations\n(which includes sigmoid, ReLU, leaky ReLU, etc.) for almost all step-sizes. Our\nwork significantly extends the existing results on the convergence of GD and\nSGD by guaranteeing that they apply to practical neural network settings and\nhas the potential to unlock further exploration of learning dynamics."}

We show that, for fixed $t$, each level of the\nhierarchy can be verified via a semidefinite program of size polynomial in $n$,\nthe size of the ground set of the set function. This is particularly relevant\ngiven existing hardness results around testing whether a set function is\nsubmodular (Crama, 1989). We derive several equivalent algebraic\ncharacterizations of $t$-sos submodularity and identify\nsubmodularity-preserving operations that also preserve $t$-sos submodularity.\nWe further present a complete classification of the cases for which\nsubmodularity and $t$-sos submodularity coincide, as well as examples of\n$t$-sos-submodular functions. We demonstrate the usefulness of $t$-sos\nsubmodularity through three applications: (i) a new convex approach to\nsubmodular regression, involving minimal manual tuning; (ii) a systematic\nprocedure to derive lower bounds on the submodularity ratio in approximate\nsubmodular maximization, and (iii) improved difference-of-submodular\ndecompositions for difference-of-submodular optimization.

Traditional graph_theoretic\nmetrics, such as betweenness and degree centrality, offer insights into local\nnetwork structure but often fail to capture global structural distortions\nresulting from link failures. On the other hand, global indices, such as those\nbased on spectral analysis of the networks graph, fail in identifying critical\nelements. This study proposes to quantify the structural modifications implied\nby the disruption of single elements in a transportation network through the\nGromov-Wasserstein distance. Specifically, we iteratively remove one single\nedge from the original network to simulate a disruptive event and then compute\nthe Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the original network and the disrupted\none. Finally, edges are ranked depending on the observed Gromov-Wasserstein\ndistance: the higher the value of the distance, the more critical the edge is\nin terms. Two transportation networks from Berlin are considered in the\nexperiments, namely Berlin Friedrichshain Center (BFC) and Berlin Tiergarten\n(BT). Results reveal that Gromov-Wasserstein is largely uncorrelated with edge\nbetweenness (rho<0.1), proving its ability to capture vulnerability aspects\noverlooked by local network measures. Moreover, Gromov-Wasserstein exhibits an\nalmost perfect correlation (rho=0.9999) against a proxy measure of the\ntransportation service level, that is, the increase in the maximum shortest\npath. As a result, the Gromov-Wasserstein distance can be used to rank edges\ndepending on their criticality with respect to their individual impact on the\noverall infrastructure and level, allowing for prioritizing maintenance,\nemergency planning, and enhancing the resilience of the urban transport\nnetwork."}
