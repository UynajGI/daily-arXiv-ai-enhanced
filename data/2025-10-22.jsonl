One way that society could withstand such\ndisruptions is to make food without agriculture. Here, I evaluate the\nfeasibility of rapidly scaling up nonagricultural food production in response\nto a disaster. I find that even in an idealized worst-case scenario where all\ncurrent agricultural production ends instantaneously and cannot be restarted,\nit may be possible for at least some countries to begin producing enough food\nwithout agriculture to feed their populations before existing food supplies run\nout. As a proof of principle, for the US, producing edible bacteria grown on\nnatural gas appears to be one feasible option for quickly making food without\nagriculture. Feeding the US population this way would require about 16% of US\nannual natural gas production, 6% of US annual electricity consumption, and\n$530 billion (1.9% of US GDP) worth of food production facilities. Several key\nfindings from this report remain uncertain, and if a disaster hits at the worst\npossible time with respect to annual variation in stored food supplies, there\nmay not be enough time to scale up other food production options. However, this\nreport suggests that some countries are close to, or may already be at, the\npoint where they could survive just about any agricultural disaster, as long as\nmodern industry remains intact. I find that there are several interventions\nthat could more thoroughly close this window of vulnerability: designing and\npiloting alternative food production facilities in advance of a disaster,\nimproving the nutritional quality of alternative foods through research and\ndevelopment, and increasing crop stock levels."}

Classical work established sufficient\nconditions, typically combining KL support with complexity bounds on sieves of\nhigh prior mass, to guarantee consistency with respect to the Hellinger\ndistance. Yet no systematic theory explains a widely held belief: under KL\nsupport, Hellinger consistency is exceptionally hard to violate. This suggests\nthat existing sufficient conditions, while useful in practice, may overlook\nsome key aspects of posterior behavior. We address this gap by directly\ninvestigating what must fail for inconsistency to arise, aiming to identify a\nsubstantive necessary condition for Hellinger inconsistency. Our starting point\nis Andrew Barron's classical counterexample, the only known violation of\nHellinger consistency under KL support, which relies on a contrived family of\noscillatory densities and a prior with atoms. We show that, within a broad\nclass of models including Barron's, inconsistency requires persistent posterior\nconcentration on densities with exponentially high likelihood ratios.

In the case of a dichotomous outcome $Y$, receiver operating\ncharacteristic analysis and the asymmetric area under the curve (AUC) measure\nare used to assess monotone dependence of $Y$ on a covariate $X$. Here we unify\nand extend thus far disconnected strands of literature, by developing common\npopulation level theory, estimators, and tests that bridge continuous and\ndichotomous settings and apply to all linearly ordered outcomes. In particular,\nwe introduce asymmetric grade correlation, AGC$(X,Y)$, as the covariance of the\nmid distribution function transforms, or grades, of $X$ and $Y$, divided by the\nvariance of the grade of $Y$. The coefficient of monotone association then is\nCMA$(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{2} ($AGC$(X,Y) + 1)$. When $X$ and $Y$ are continuous, AGC\nis symmetric and equals Spearman's Rho. When $Y$ is dichotomous, CMA equals\nAUC.

We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field\ndisordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission\namplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply\nit to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier,\nwhich formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the\ninfluence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators,\nwe identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading\nin Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by\nrare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase\nwhere such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size\nphase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the\nAnderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based\non real-space spin-spin correlation functions.

They are expected to\nplay a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the\ndevelopment of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their\nstatistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field\ndisordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission\namplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply\nit to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier,\nwhich formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the\ninfluence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators,\nwe identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading\nin Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by\nrare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase\nwhere such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size\nphase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the\nAnderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based\non real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even\ninfinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite\ndisorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction\nstrengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space\ngraph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral\nprobes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes\nstems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and\nshorter-ranged deep in the localized phase."}

However, many of the current methods struggle when it\ncomes to fully embracing circular economy principles. Enhancing the design and\nmanagement of these networks holds significant potential to promote stronger\ncollaboration among supply chain partners, ultimately fostering more\nsustainable and efficient operational practices. For this purpose, this study\naddresses a new circular economy model based on a real case study of a mask SC\nin the healthcare sector in British Columbia, Canada. The objective is to show\nthat implementing circular practices can lead to considerable financial and\nenvironmental benefits, as well as the creation of new job opportunities. To\nachieve this, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is\ndeveloped to identify the most efficient trade-off among sustainable\nobjectives, while adhering to imposed constraints. The proposed closed-loop SC\nmodel outperforms the existing linear model in all three aspects of\nsustainability, namely economic, environmental and social. The improvement\nleads to significant economic and environmental benefits by preventing the\ndisposal of used masks, giving them a second chance for disinfection and\nreprocessing, and reintroducing them into the SC as new ones. While the results\nof the circular economy model demonstrate profit gains and environmental\nrecovery, the linear SC model showed negative profit with higher carbon\nemissions. Regarding the social aspects, compared to the current system, our\napproach not only nearly doubles the number of jobs created but also\nsignificantly reduces shortages, highlighting sustainable development aspects\nrelated to equity and social welfare. The findings offer valuable insights for\nresearchers and practitioners seeking to implement sustainability within a\ncircular economy framework in SCs."}

Nevertheless, adaptive identification methods that\nintegrate quantized observations with $\\ell_1$-optimization remain largely\nunderexplored. Motivated by this gap, we develop a novel $\\ell_1$-based\nadaptive identification algorithm specifically designed for quantized\nobservations. Without relying on the traditional persistent excitation\ncondition, we establish global convergence of the parameter estimates to their\ntrue values and show that the average regret asymptotically vanishes as the\ndata size increases. Finally, we apply our new identification algorithm to a\njudicial sentencing problem using real-world data, which demonstrates its\nsuperior performance and practical significance."}

This letter proposes a self-governing harmonic mitigation strategy\nthrough coordinated operation of multiple ELZs in large power-to-hydrogen (P2H)\nplants. First, the harmonic model of TR-powered ELZs is derived, revealing a\nnatural harmonic cancellation mechanism among them. Based on this, a\nsystem-level operation scheme based on phasor modulation is developed and\nintegrated into plant scheduling. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod reduces harmonic currents by 21.2%-39.7% and ensures grid-code\ncompliance, with only a 0.25% loss in hydrogen output, while increasing total\nrevenue by over 21\\% compared to production-oriented strategies."}

However, DRO problems often involve\ninfinitely many inequality constraints, rendering exact solutions\ncomputationally expensive. In this study, we propose a discrete DRO (DDRO)\nmethod that significantly simplifies the problem by reducing it to a single\ntrivial constraint. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes two types of\ndistributional uncertainty balls to reformulate the DDRO problem into a\nsingle-layer smooth convex program, significantly improving tractability.\nFurthermore, we provide practical guidance for selecting the appropriate ball\nsizes. The original DDRO problem is further reformulated into two optimization\nproblems: one minimizing the mean and standard deviation, and the other\nminimizing the conditional value at risk (CVaR). These formulations account for\nthe choice of ball sizes, thereby enhancing the practical applicability of the\nmethod. The proposed method was applied to a distributionally robust\npatrol-agent design problem, identifying a Pareto front in which the mean and\nstandard deviation of the mean hitting time varied by up to 3% and 14%,\nrespectively, while achieving a CVaR reduction of up to 13%."}
