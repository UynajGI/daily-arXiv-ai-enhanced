In this work, we investigate the nonequilibrium steady states\nof the Haldane model driven by a continuous-wave laser and coupled to a thermal\nreservoir. Dissipation is modeled within the Lindblad formalism adapted for\nquadratic fermionic systems, enabling us to study both the relaxation dynamics\nand the emergence of quasi-steady states. While conventional topological\ninvariants and the bulk-boundary correspondence do not directly apply to such\nnonequilibrium settings, we introduce an occupation-weighted Chern number that\ncaptures the residual topological character of this quasi-steady state. We\nadditionally examine the charge transport of this system under simultaneous\ndriving and damping, showing that inversion symmetry breaking via a staggered\nsublattice potential generates a finite DC current. The magnitude and direction\nof this DC current are sensitive to the driving strength, highlighting the\nintricate interplay between topology, symmetry, and dissipation in open quantum\nsystems."}

For static sources, the metric\narises from a relativistic formulation of D'Alembert's principle, where the\ninertial force is treated as a real dynamical entity that exactly compensates\ngravity. This leads to a conformastatic metric whose geodesic equation,\nparametrized by proper time, reproduces the relativistic version of Newton's\nsecond law for free fall. To extend the description to moving matter, uniformly\nor otherwise, we apply a Lorentz transformation to the static metric. The\nresulting non static metric accounts for the motion of the sources and,\nremarkably, matches the weak field limit of general relativity as obtained from\nthe linearized Einstein equations in the de Donder or Lorenz gauge.

However, finding high-quality solutions\nto MINLPs is often computationally demanding. This has motivated the\ndevelopment of specialized algorithms that take advantage of the structure of\nsome MINLPs to improve their tractability. In this work, we propose the\nMixed-integer Smoothing Surrogate Optimization with Constraints (MiSSOC)\napproach, a novel optimization algorithm that builds and solves surrogate\nproblems for complex MINLPs which are more tractable in practice. MiSSOC\nintegrates statistical modeling into mathematical optimization by approximating\ncomplex functions in an MINLP using smooth additive regression models with\n$B-$splines. Expert knowledge can be incorporated into the building phase of\nthe approximating functions through shape constraints related to sign (or\nbounds), monotonicity and convexity over the observed domain. Thus, MiSSOC\nfills a gap in the literature by building surrogates that are both data-driven\nand knowledge-driven. The surrogate problem is formulated by replacing the\noriginal complex functions with their approximations. The proposed MiSSOC\nalgorithm is evaluated through a set of experiments, including benchmark\ninstances and a real-world case study. MiSSOC is tested with different\nstate-of-the-art solvers and with the tailored Sequential Convex MINLP\n(SC-MINLP) algorithm.

In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to\nunderstand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing\non the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional\nquantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent\nphotons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte\nCarlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which\nis further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show\nthat the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal\ncharacteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the\nglobal phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the\nferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as\ntwo distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI\nshows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the\nclassical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss\nour results, especially for the $\\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing\nexperimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results\ndemonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also\nbe viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of\nquantum magnets."}

While most existing\napplications of QKD in the power sector focus on building secure point-to-point\ncommunication tunnels, they rarely consider the system-level coupling between\nkey dynamics and control scheduling. In contrast, our approach integrates\nquantum key generation, consumption, inventory prediction, and control latency\ninto a unified model, enabling key-aware reconfiguration of SCADA control\nchains based on task security demands and real-time resource constraints. To\nresolve conflicts in key resource allocation between transmission system\noperators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs), we formulate a\nbi-level Stackelberg game and transform it into a mathematical program with\ncomplementarity constraints (MPCC). We further develop an efficient Level\nDecomposition-Complementarity Pruning (LD-CP) algorithm to solve the problem.\nTo support reproducible evaluation, we build an end-to-end co-simulation\nplatform that integrates physical-layer disruptions via OpenQKD-Sim,\nQ3P/IEC-104 protocol stack binding, and real-time control-chain monitoring\nthrough Grafana.

In particular, during\nthe preliminary design phase of space missions, the combinatorial complexity of\nMGA sequencing is very large, and current optimization approaches require\nextensive experience and can take many days to simulate. Therefore, a novel\noptimization approach is developed here -- called the Recursive Target Body\nApproach (RTBA) -- that uses the hodographic-shaping low-thrust trajectory\nrepresentation together with a unique combination of tree-search methods to\nautomate the optimization of MGA sequences. The approach gradually constructs\nthe optimal MGA sequence by recursively evaluating the optimality of subsequent\ngravity-assist targets. Another significant contribution to the novelty of this\nwork is the use of parallelization in an original way involving the Generalized\nIsland Model (GIM) that enables the use of new figures of merit to further\nincrease the robustness and accelerate the convergence. An Earth-Jupiter\ntransfer with a maximum of three gravity assists is considered as a reference\nproblem. The RTBA takes 21.5 hours to find an EMJ transfer with 15.4 km/s\n$\\Delta V$ to be the optimum. Extensive tuning improved the quality of the MGA\ntrajectories substantially, and as a result a robust low-thrust trajectory\noptimization could be ensured.

The main\ncontribution of this work is the analysis of the rank of such matrices where\nthe particles (sources/targets) are arbitrarily distributed within these\nhypercubes. To our knowledge, this is the first work to formally investigate\nthe rank of such matrices for an arbitrary distribution of particles. We model\nthe arbitrary distribution of particles to arise from an underlying random\ndistribution and obtain bounds on the expected rank and variance of the rank of\nthe kernel matrix corresponding to various neighbor interactions. These bounds\nare useful for understanding the performance and complexity of hierarchical\nmatrix algorithms (especially hierarchical matrices satisfying the\nweak-admissibility criterion) for an arbitrary distribution of particles. We\nalso present numerical experiments in one-, two-, and three-dimensions, showing\nthe expected rank growth and variance of the rank for different types of\ninteractions. The numerical results, not surprisingly, align with our\ntheoretical predictions."}

However, theoretical analysis of their computational complexity lags\nbehind practice. In particular, it is important to bound the number of function\nevaluations required to achieve a desired level of accuracy.
