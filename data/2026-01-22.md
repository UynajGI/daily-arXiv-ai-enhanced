### [1] [Acoustic phonons in a magnetized vacuum? First-principle lattice results on the mass spectrum of the electroweak model in a strong magnetic field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14573)
*M. N. Chernodub,V. A. Goy,A. V. Molochkov*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: 通过数值蒙特卡洛模拟研究电弱模型玻色子谱在电弱尺度强磁场下的行为，发现沿磁场方向的W玻色子自旋分量在所有相中均为最轻激发，并在中间非均匀相中接近无质量，对应于电弱涡旋晶格的戈德斯通声子模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强磁场下电弱真空相变过程中玻色子质量谱的变化，特别是W玻色子在不同相中的低能激发特性。

Method: 采用零温下的数值蒙特卡洛模拟方法，计算电弱模型玻色子在强度为10^20 T的外部磁场中的质量谱。

Result: 发现沿磁场方向的W玻色子自旋分量始终是最轻激发，在中间涡旋相中其质量极小，表现为类似戈德斯通声子的模式；在高场对称恢复相中质量回升；Higgs和Z玻色子质量在整个过程中均不趋于零。

Conclusion: W玻色子在强磁场下的低质量激发与电弱涡旋晶格的动力学密切相关，揭示了非均匀相中潜在的集体激发模式。

Abstract: We use numerical Monte Carlo simulations to determine the mass spectrum of the bosonic sector of the electroweak model in an external magnetic field of the electroweak-scale strength ($10^{20}\,{\rm T}$) at zero temperature. It is known that as the magnetic field gets stronger, the electroweak vacuum undergoes two consecutive crossover-type transitions, passing from (i) the conventional symmetry-broken homogeneous phase to (ii) an intermediate inhomogeneous vortex phase characterized by a (superconducting) condensate of electrically charged $W$ bosons and then to (iii) a homogeneous phase with a restored electroweak symmetry. We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again. Neither Higgs nor $Z$ boson masses vanish across all studied phases and crossover transitions.

### [2] [Shear and bulk viscosities of gluon plasma across the transition temperature from lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14967)
*Heng-Tong Ding,Hai-Tao Shu,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: 通过格点QCD研究胶子等离子体在0.76–2.25 Tc温度范围内的剪切粘度和体积粘度，发现η/s在Tc附近有最小值，而ζ/s在整个范围内单调递减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解强相互作用物质在极端温度下的输运性质，特别是在QCD相变附近的粘滞行为。

Method: 采用高精度格点QCD模拟，结合梯度流和阻断技术，对能量-动量张量关联函数进行连续极限外推，并利用模型化谱分析提取粘度系数。

Result: 剪切粘度与熵密度比η/s在Tc附近达到最小值，随后随温度升高而增加；体积粘度与熵密度比ζ/s在整个温度范围内单调下降。

Conclusion: 胶子等离子体在相变区域表现出强烈的非微扰效应，η/s的极小值暗示该系统在Tc附近接近完美流体。

Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity ($η$) and bulk viscosity ($ζ$) of the gluon plasma using lattice QCD over the range 0.76--2.25 $T_c$, extending from below the transition temperature $T_c$ across the transition region and into the deconfined phase. At each temperature, we employ three large, fine lattices, which enables controlled continuum extrapolations of the energy-momentum tensor correlators. Using gradient flow together with a recently developed blocking technique, we achieve percent level precision for these correlators, providing strong constraints for a model-based spectral analysis. Since the inversion to real-time information is intrinsically ill posed, we extract viscosities by fitting spectral functions whose ultraviolet behavior is matched to the best available perturbative result, while the infrared region is described by a Lorentzian transport peak. The dominant modeling uncertainty associated with the transport-peak width is bracketed by varying it over a physically motivated range set by thermal scales. We find that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $η/s$, exhibits a minimum near the transition temperature $T_c$ and increases for $T>T_c$, whereas the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $ζ/s$, decreases monotonically over the entire temperature range studied.

### [3] [The burden of Fundamentality: Metaphysical ambiguities and the issue of Superdeterminism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14316)
*Gabriele Cafiero,Luca Molinari,Jonte R. Hance*

Main category: physics.hist-ph

TL;DR: 本文从新的视角探讨了超决定论，强调其更偏向形而上学而非科学命题的性质，区分了两种类型的超决定论理论，并指出其中一种存在显著的认识论缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示超决定论在科学与形而上学之间的界限问题，批判其假设自身基础性的方法论缺陷。

Method: 通过区分朴素超决定论（NSD）与形而上学超决定论（MSD），分析其认识论基础，并以不变集理论为例进行批判性考察。

Result: 发现NSD具有显著的认识论缺陷，且最发达的MSD模型隐含了一种混乱的优先一元论形式。

Conclusion: 理论应通过论证展示其基础性，而不应为回避批评而预设自身的基础性地位。

Abstract: In this paper we approach the problem of superdeterminism from a novel point of view, highlighting its character as a more metaphysical than scientific proposition. First, we introduce a distinction between two types of superdeterministic theories, naïve (NSD) and metaphysical (MSD), and argue how NSD presents significant epistemic flaws. We show how NSD justifies itself through claims to fundamentality, thus connoting itself as a metaphysical theory rather than a scientific one. We finally illustrate that the most developed MSD model so far, Invariant Set Theory, implicitly proposes a confused form of priority monism. Our paper thus reinforces the thesis that theories should demonstrate rather than assume fundamentality and that it is methodologically flawed for a theory to assume its own fundamentality for the sole purpose of defending against criticisms.

### [4] [Limits of the Formal Integrals of Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14899)
*George Contopoulos,Athanasios C. Tzemos,Foivos Zanias*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: 本文研究了一类广义哈密顿系统中形式化的运动积分，考虑了频率比为有理数和无理数的情况，特别分析了多种共振情形下的积分存在性，并通过不变曲线与轨道比较了数值与理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在更一般的非线性扰动哈密顿系统中近似运动积分的存在性和结构，扩展以往仅限于特定参数条件的研究。

Method: 采用形式化摄动方法构造近似运动积分，分析不同频率比（特别是共振情况）下的积分形式，并结合数值模拟计算不变曲线与轨道进行验证。

Result: 得到了当ω₁/ω₂为无理数时的通用积分形式；针对4/1、5/1、3/2等共振情形进行了具体分析；在2/1和1/1情况下计算了不变曲线与轨道，并发现当ηαβγ≠0时1/1共振下无法找到精确积分，但可用接近1.010的非共振积分近似。

Conclusion: 在广泛参数范围内建立了近似运动积分的存在性，揭示了共振与非共振条件下系统动力学行为的差异，表明即使在不可积情况下也可用非共振积分有效逼近系统行为。

Abstract: We consider a formal (approximate) integral of motion in Hamiltonians of the form $H=\frac{1}{2}(X^2+Y^2+ω_1^2x^2+ω_2^2y^2)+ε(ηxy^2+αx^3+βx^2y+γy^3)$ generalizing previous cases with $β=γ=0$. First we give the general form of this integral when $ω_1/ω_2$ is irrational and then we consider the case of commensurable frequencies. In particular we study the integrals for the resonances $ω_1/ω_2=4/1, 5/1, 3/2, 4/3, 3/1$ and $2/1$. We also calculate the invariant curves and the orbits in the cases $ω_1/ω_2=2/1$ and $1/1$ (with $β=γ=0$) and we compare the exact-numerical and the theoretical results predicted by the formal integral when $βγ\neq0$. In the special case $ω_1/ω_2=1/1$ we find an integral when $β=γ=0$ and $ηα\neq0$ or $η=α=0$ and $βγ\neq 0$, but this is not possible when $ηαβγ\neq 0$. However, we find that the invariant curves and the orbits can be approximated by a non-resonant integral with $ω_1/ω_2=5\sqrt{2}/7=1.010\dots$.

### [5] [The phenomenon of resonance in the continuous phase transition of finite-size systems: A passage from Classical World to Quantum World through the resonance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15225)
*Yiannis F. Contoyiannis,Stelios M. Potirakis*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: 在经历连续相变的有限系统中，共振现象出现在滞后区域内，并与准粒子的存在相关联，可能标志着从经典相到量子相的连续过渡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索有限系统中连续相变时滞后区域内的共振现象及其物理意义。

Method: 通过理论分析研究滞后区内的平均等待时间随温度的变化，探讨共振现象与准粒子（如扭结孤子）的关系。

Result: 发现滞后区内存在共振现象，表现为平均等待时间在某一温度下达到最大值，并提出该共振可能连接经典相与量子相。

Conclusion: 共振现象不仅揭示了滞后区域内的动力学特征，还可能为理解二元系统的经典-量子相变提供新视角。

Abstract: In finite-size systems undergoing a continuous phase transition, the passage from the symmetric phase to the broken-symmetry phase is accomplished through a hysteresis zone, up to spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In the present work, we find that a resonance phenomenon takes place within this zone. This resonance is manifested as a maximization of the mean waiting time as a function of temperature inside the hysteresis region. An interesting issue concerns how this resonance is connected with the existence of particles (tachyons) or quasiparticles (kink solitons) within the hysteresis zone. Finally, we introduce the idea that this resonance delineates a continuous passage from a "classical" phase to a "quantum" phase for a binary system, such as the three-dimensional Ising model, which belongs to the same universality class as a fermion-antifermion system or, more generally, a matter-antimatter system.

### [6] [Dirac's Dilemma of the Economy of Inheritance: Parental Care, Equality of Opportunity, and Managed Inequality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14322)
*Karl Svozil*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 本文探讨了P.A.M.狄拉克提出的一个社会困境：父母为子女谋求更好未来与所有人应有平等机会之间的冲突，分析其在政治哲学中的根源，并主张采取“受管理的不平等”政策，在保障基本公平和流动性的前提下，有限度地接受继承性优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回应狄拉克提出的关于亲子偏爱与社会公平之间结构性矛盾的问题，探索如何在维护社会正义的同时不破坏促进整体繁荣的社会机制。

Method: 通过重建狄拉克困境，结合复利优势与继承机制的动态分析，联系罗尔斯、德沃金、诺齐克等人的政治哲学理论进行比较与综合。

Result: 发现完全消除由继承带来的不公可能损害产生普遍繁荣的非零和结构；提出‘受管理的不平等’作为解决方案。

Conclusion: 应建立坚实的社会底线和真实的流动性，限制极端的世袭财富积累，同时明确接受一定程度被约束的继承优势，以实现正义与激励之间的平衡。

Abstract: In a brief reflection on the principles of human society, P. A. M. Dirac articulated a structural tension between two widely affirmed norms: that it is good and natural for parents to improve the prospects of their own children, and that justice requires that all children have equal opportunities in life. These principles, each compelling on its own, cannot be fully realized together. This paper reconstructs Dirac's dilemma, connects it to the dynamics of compounding advantage and inheritance, and situates it within the broader history of political philosophy, including the work of Rawls, Dworkin, Cohen, Brighouse and Swift, Nozick, Murphy and Nagel, and others. The paper argues that attempts to eliminate the resulting injustices entirely risk damaging the non--zero--sum structures that generate general prosperity, and defends a position of "managed inequality": a robust social floor and real mobility, combined with limits on extreme dynastic accumulation and an explicit acceptance of some residual, but constrained, inherited advantage.

### [7] [Understanding Crash Dynamics and Severity of EV Paratransit: Evidence From Easy Bike Accidents in Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14276)
*Nazmul Haque*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 本研究分析了2016至2024年孟加拉国便捷自行车（easy bike）交通事故数据，探讨事故发生与严重程度的影响因素，发现事故多发于白天、铺装道路和低密度城乡结合部，交叉口与弯道为高风险区域；碰撞类型是决定致死率的关键，涉及行人和追尾事故更易致死，而翻车事故较轻；环境因素影响较小；建议加强特定地点和碰撞类型的针对性安全措施，并提升事故数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便捷自行车在孟加拉国作为经济实惠的“最后一公里”交通工具日益普及，但随之而来的道路安全问题日益突出，亟需系统分析其事故成因与严重性影响因素，以制定有效的安全管理策略。

Method: 利用2016至2024年全国交通事故数据，采用描述性统计分析事故发生特征，并通过二元Logit和Probit模型评估事故严重程度的影响因素。

Result: 事故多发生于白天、铺装道路和低密度城乡地区，交叉口和弯道为高风险位置；碰撞类型显著影响严重性，行人碰撞和追尾事故更可能导致死亡，翻车事故后果较轻；温度、降雨和时段等环境因素对严重性影响有限；不同车辆类型（如摩托车、公交、卡车）参与的事故危险性不同。

Conclusion: 需针对高风险地点（如交叉口、弯道）和高危碰撞类型（如行人碰撞、追尾）制定基于证据的干预措施，并改善事故数据收集质量，以支持科学决策，降低便捷自行车事故频率与严重性。

Abstract: Easy bikes have emerged as a popular and affordable mode of last-mile transport in Bangladesh, yet their widespread use has been accompanied by growing concerns about road safety. This study investigates the underlying factors influencing both the occurrence and severity of easy bike crashes by analyzing nationwide crash data spanning from 2016 to 2024. The findings reveal that crashes predominantly occur during daytime, on paved (pucca) roads, and in low-density peri-urban areas. Intersections and curved road segments are also identified as high-risk zones for crash occurrence. Crash severity analysis, supported by binary logit and probit models, emphasizes that the type of collision plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of fatal outcomes. Pedestrian-involved crashes and rear-end collisions are more frequently associated with fatalities, whereas crashes involving overturns tend to result in less severe consequences. In contrast, environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and time of day exhibit limited impact on crash severity. The distribution of crash types also varies across vehicle categories, with motorcycles, buses, and trucks commonly involved in more dangerous collision scenarios. These findings focus on the urgent need for targeted road safety interventions focusing on specific crash types, high-risk locations such as intersections and curves, and vulnerable road users. Moreover, the study underscores the necessity for improving crash data quality, especially in underreported cases, to support informed decision-making. Based on these insights, the study also proposes a set of evidence-based and context-specific interventions aimed at reducing both the frequency and severity of easy bike crashes in Bangladesh.

### [8] [How the Shale Revolution is Shaping the Future of the Oil and Gas Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14281)
*Binh T. Bui*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 本文探讨了页岩革命技术如何通过工业化生产模式提升油气产量，并可能延长低油价时期，影响全球能源政策和投资策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析页岩革命技术在非常规和常规油藏中的应用潜力，及其对全球原油供应和价格的长期影响。

Method: 通过回顾美国和阿根廷的成功案例，总结水平钻井、多级水力压裂和循环气体注入等关键技术的作用，并评估工业化生产模式对成本和效率的影响。

Result: 该模式显著提高了钻井效率，降低了成本，推动了原油产量大幅增长，并有望在全球范围内扩展至常规储层。

Conclusion:  abundant supply from both unconventional and conventional developments could lead to a prolonged period of low oil prices, with significant implications for energy policy and investment.

Abstract: The shale revolution, driven by advances in horizontal drilling, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, and cyclic gas injection, has reshaped the oil and gas industry over the past two decades. In the United States, these technologies transformed ultra-low permeability shale formations into commercially viable resources, increasing crude oil production from 5 million bpd in 2008 to more than 12 million by 2019. Horizontal drilling became the standard after 2010, with nearly 200,000 horizontal wells completed by the end of 2023, accounting for more than 80% of all new wells in the US. This success is now being replicated in Argentina making the country a leading unconventional producer. The common driver in both cases is the mass manufacturing approach, which industrializes oil production through standardized well designs, repeatable workflows, multi-well pad drilling, and continuous process optimization. Supported by a competitive oilfield service market and a skilled technical workforce, this model has reduced drilling times from months to weeks and cut well costs by half over the past decade. New technologies such as precision geosteering, advanced completion designs, real-time drilling analytics, and cyclic gas injection continue to improve efficiency and productivity. Applying these methods and technologies to conventional reservoirs could significantly expand global production capacity and place sustained downward pressure on crude oil prices. This paper argues that in a period of slowing economic growth and potential financial deleveraging, abundant supply from both unconventional and conventional developments could extend a prolonged phase of relatively low oil prices. Such a scenario would have far-reaching implications for energy policy, investment strategies, and the competitive position of oil-producing nations.

### [10] [Assessing the livability within the 15-minute city concept based on mobile phone data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14307)
*Tianqi Wang,Teemu Jama,Henrikki Tenkanen*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 本研究利用赫尔辛基大都会区的手机数据，评估了密度、多样性、邻近性等传统宜居性指标对实际人类活动模式的预测能力，发现这些指标在白天有效，但在夜间作用减弱，且空间上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市规划中关于步行友好性和宜居性的研究多关注静态空间特征，缺乏对时间动态和真实人类活动的结合分析。本研究旨在通过实证数据揭示时空动态下宜居性指标的有效性与局限性。

Method: 基于文献选取多样性、密度、可达性等宜居性指标，构建吸引力与步行友好性两个维度，并利用移动电话数据提取人类活动模式；采用地理加权回归分析其时空关系。

Result: 综合宜居性指数比单一吸引力更能解释人类活动分布，但该关系具有时间不稳定性（夜间显著减弱）和空间异质性；传统步行友好性目标对15分钟城市可持续出行目标的影响有限。

Conclusion: 城市规划需超越传统的功能混合与高密度策略，采取更具时空针对性和功能细分的大尺度发展路径，以真正实现可持续城市 mobility 目标。

Abstract: Many cities promote walkability through concepts such as the compact city and 15-minute city to enhance urban livability, yet few methods link spatial walkability features to empirically measured livability and account for temporal dynamics. The method developed for this study uses mobile phone data from the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Finland) to assess whether commonly used, literature-derived livability indicators (diversity, density, proximity, accessibility) predict observed human activity patterns across different times of day.
  We constructed two key dimensions of livability: attractiveness and walkability with quantifiable sub-indicators that were selected based on literature. Our analysis shows that walkability, and even more so the combined livability index, correlates with activity patterns, outperforming the pure attractiveness perspective. However, this relationship is temporally unstable, significantly weakening at night and fluctuating daily. Moreover, based on Geographically Weighted Regression analysis, our results reveal significant spatial variation in the relationship between livability and the intensity of human activities. The findings suggest that traditional urban planning goals, such as functional diversity to enhance walkability, contribute to livability but have a limited impact on the 15-minute city's overall sustainable mobility objectives, necessitating a larger-scale perspective and more functionally profiled approaches for urban development.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Building upon previous research, this paper further explores the topological foundations for maintaining universal rules within ultra-large-scale societies. It finds that in small-scale societies, absolute egalitarianism and the rule of law can be compatible through peer monitoring within a fully connected network. However, in ultra-large-scale societies, to maintain high-dimensional rules capable of protecting innovation and property rights, a complex hierarchical structure including "high-fragility" nodes must be constructed. Through quantitative analysis of power structures, this paper proves that a flattened, two-tier structure inevitably leads to the degradation of the rule of law. Only a social topology with sufficient hierarchical depth can escape the deathly trap of the Leviathan while expanding in scale, thereby sustaining the dynamic evolution of civilization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study investigates the mathematical existence and asymptotic properties of Ulanowicz's structural resilience in complex systems such as supply chain networks. While ecological evidence suggests that sustainable systems gravitate toward an optimal state at $α= 1/\mathrm{e}$, the universality of this configuration in generalized networks remains theoretically unverified. We prove that while optimal resilience is unattainable in two-node networks due to structural over-determinacy, it exists for any directed graph with $N_\mathcal{V} \geq 3$. By constructing a symmetric network model with three types of link weights $(x, y, z)$ and uniform marginal distributions, we derive the governing equations for the optimal resilience configuration. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that as the network size $N_\mathcal{V}$ increases, the link weights required to maintain optimal resilience exhibit a power-law scaling behavior: the adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-1})$, while the non-adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-2})$, both accompanied by specific logarithmic corrections. This work establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the optimal resilience framework and provides a unified perspective on how entropy-based principles govern the robustness and evolution of large-scale complex networks, which may offer quantitative guidance for designing large-scale networked systems under robustness constraints.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Contagion processes in social systems often involve interactions that go beyond pairwise contacts. Higher-order networks, represented as hypergraphs, have been widely used to model multi-body interactions, and their presence can drastically alter contagion dynamics compared to traditional network models. However, existing analytical approaches typically assume independence between pairwise and higher-order degrees, and thus study their roles in isolation. In this paper, we develop an effective hyperdegree model (EHDM) to describe Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) dynamics on hypergraphs that explicitly captures correlations between the distribution of groups with different sizes. Our effective hyperdegree model shows excellent agreement with stochastic simulations across different types of higher-order networks, including those with heterogeneous degree distributions. We explore the critical role of cross-order degree correlations, specifically, whether nodes that are hubs in pairwise interactions also serve as hubs in higher-order interactions. We show that positive correlation decreases the epidemic threshold and anti-correlation temporally desynchronizes infection pathways (pairwise and group interactions). Finally, we demonstrate that, depending on the level of correlation, the optimal control strategy shifts -- from one that is purely pairwise- or higher-order-focused to one in which a mixed strategy becomes optimal.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于复杂量子系统模拟的参数估计提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，有助于精确提取夸克-胶子等离子体的物理性质。

Abstract: We study parameter estimation for the transport coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma by differentiating open-quantum-system-based Monte Carlo simulations of quarkonium suppression. The underlying simulator requires solving a Lindblad equation in a large Hilbert space, which makes parameter estimation computationally expensive. We approach the problem using gradient-based optimization. Specifically, we apply the score-function gradient estimator to differentiate through discrete jump sampling in the Monte Carlo wave-function algorithm used to solve the Lindblad equation. The resulting stochastic gradient estimator exhibits sufficiently low variance and can still be estimated in an embarrassingly parallel manner, enabling efficient scaling of the simulations. We implement this gradient estimator in the existing open-source quarkonium suppression code QTraj. To demonstrate its utility for parameter estimation, we infer the two transport coefficients $\hatκ$ and $\hatγ$ using gradient-based optimization on synthetic nuclear modification factor data.

Abstract: Field emission coupled with molecular dynamics simulation (FEcMD) software package is a computational tool for studying atomic structure evolution, structural deformation, phase transitions, recrystallization as well as electron emission characteristics of micro- and nano-protrusions and nanowires consisting of elemental metals or multi-component alloys by means of multi-physics and multi-scale methodology. Current implementations of molecular dynamics simulation coupled with multi-scale electrodynamics (ED) and heat conduction (HC) in FEcMD program are advanced mainly in the two aspects as follows. In electrodynamics, the FEcMD program incorporates the space charge interactions (space charge potential and exchange-correlation effects) in the self-consistent solved Poisson-Schrödinger equation with Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) approximation to evaluate the field emission current density and the related resistive heating process more reliably for nanowires or nano-protrusions especially for nano-gaps between two metal electrodes. Meanwhile, the two-temperature heat conduction model is implemented in electrodynamics coupled with molecular dynamics simulations (ED-MD), providing more dedicated descriptions for the hierarchical electron-phonon two-channel heat conduction mechanism and the temperature evolutions of electron and phonon subsystems under the radiofrequency (RF) or pulse electric fields. Benchmark tests are performed for some key implementations in FEcMD software to validate the numerical results, and also to demonstrate the use of program to study the atomic structure evolution of metal nano-structures under electric field and heating processes.

Conclusion: Kasteleyn相变概念可推广至某些二维阻挫量子磁体系统，且可通过模型参数实现对相变锐度的调控，为在有机金属化合物中实现此类模型提供了可能。

Abstract: We show that the Kasteleyn transition, the abrupt proliferation of infinite strings of defects in classical dimer and related models, can also be relevant for frustrated 2d quantum magnets. This is explicitly demonstrated in a phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond-decorated honeycomb lattice where a family of exact eigenstates built as products of dimer and plaquette singlets can be mapped onto the dimer coverings of the honeycomb lattice. The low-temperature properties of this phase are accurately described by an effective dimer model with anisotropic activities and a small, tunable density of monomers, leading to an arbitrarily sharp crossover version of the Kasteleyn transition. The generalization to other geometries and the possibility to realize this model in organo-metallic compounds are briefly discussed.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在互补金属氧化物半导体模型中动态随机存取存储器和静态随机存取存储器的比特擦除热力学成本，发现动态随机存取存储器在准静态极限下耗能最少且错误最小，而静态随机存取存储器则在有限时间内操作更高效。

Motivation: 由于信息处理的能源成本呈指数增长，比特擦除成为能源与信息关系中的关键问题，需要在远离平衡态的实际物理系统中探讨其热力学成本。

Method: 采用均场理论和自动微分方法，对两种随机存取存储器模型进行数值稳健的优化方案研究。

Result: 发现动态随机存取存储器在准静态极限下能耗最低且错误最小；静态随机存取存储器因维持比特状态所需能量，在有限时间内操作更为高效。

Conclusion: 研究结果为现实电路以热力学上有利的方式运行提供了框架。

Abstract: Energy costs of information processing are growing exponentially. Bit erasure is a key problem in this energy-information nexus, and a number of seminal relationships have been deduced regarding the relationship between thermodynamic costs and memory storage. To continue making progress in the modern era, however, requires confronting thermodynamic costs in realistic physical systems which operate away from equilibrium. Here, we explore the thermodynamic costs of bit erasure in a complementary metal oxide semiconductor model of two types of random access memory. We find dynamic random access memory dissipates the least amount of energy when operated in the quasistatic limit, where errors are also minimized. By contrast, static random access memory is most efficiently operated in finite time due to the energy required to maintain the state of the bit. We demonstrate a numerically robust optimization scheme using mean field theory and automatic differentiation, finding optimal protocols compatible with electrical engineering insights. These results provide a framework for operating realistic circuits in thermodynamically advantageous ways.

Conclusion: 该理论为解释半刚性聚合物在不良溶剂中的形态多样性提供了统一且透明的自由能框架。

Abstract: Semiflexible polymers in poor solvents exhibit a rich variety of collapsed morphologies, including globules, toroids, and rodlike bundles, arising from the competition between attractive interactions and chain stiffness. Computer simulations and experiments on stiff and conjugated polymers have revealed complex morphological crossovers, yet a unified theoretical description remains incomplete. Here we develop a coarse-grained, field-theoretic free-energy framework for linear polymers with variable stiffness that captures these morphologies and their transitions within a common description. The theory is built on three key ingredients: a density field describing monomer attraction and excluded-volume effects, a nematic order parameter accounting for orientational ordering in dense regions, and the bending rigidity of a worm-like chain. Using simple variational ansatzes for competing morphologies, we derive analytic expressions for their free energies and identify the boundaries separating coil, globule, toroidal, and rodlike conformational regimes as functions of the reduced attraction strength and the effective persistence length. The resulting phase-diagram topology provides a transparent free-energy-based framework for interpreting morphology diagrams observed in simulations and experiments on semiflexible polymers in poor solvents. We find the possibility of the existence of a triple point involving globules, rods and toroids.

Abstract: In this article, we formulate topology optimization problems concerning the mass distribution as minimization problems for functionals on the Wasserstein space. We relax optimization problems regarding non-convex objective functions on the Wasserstein space by using the Neumann heat semigroup and prove the existence of minimizers of relaxed problems. Furthermore, we introduce the filtered Wasserstein gradient flow and derive the error estimate between the original Wasserstein gradient flow and the filtered one in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We also construct a candidate for the optimal mass distribution for a given fixed total mass and simultaneously obtain the shape of the material by the numerical calculation of filtered Wasserstein gradient flows.

Motivation: 现有ADMM求解器在处理长预测范围时难以并行化，且通常依赖于稀疏MPC结构或显式的QP构造，限制了计算效率和应用灵活性。

Method: 在ADMM框架中引入新的变量分裂策略和基于速度的系统表示，实现预测域内的并行计算，并直接操作系统矩阵而无需将MPC问题转化为QP形式。

Result: 实现了 horizon-wise 的并行执行，提升了长预测范围下的计算效率，且避免了复杂的MPC到QP的构造过程。

Conclusion: πMPC算法在保持代码简洁的同时，实现了良好的并行性能和实用性，适用于嵌入式模型预测控制。

Abstract: The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has gained increasing popularity in embedded model predictive control (MPC) due to its code simplicity and pain-free parameter selection. However, existing ADMM solvers either target general quadratic programming (QP) problems or exploit sparse MPC formulations via Riccati recursions, which are inherently sequential and therefore difficult to parallelize for long prediction horizons. This technical note proposes a novel \textit{parallel-in-horizon} and \textit{construction-free} nonlinear MPC algorithm, termed $π$MPC, which combines a new variable-splitting scheme with a velocity-based system representation in the ADMM framework, enabling horizon-wise parallel execution while operating directly on system matrices without explicit MPC-to-QP construction. Numerical experiments and accompanying code are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于静态事件触发机制的多变量牛顿型极值搜索控制策略，通过引入Hessian逆矩阵的动态估计器实现可调节的收敛速度，并利用事件触发机制减少控制更新次数，同时保证系统稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的极值搜索方法收敛速度受代价函数Hessian矩阵影响，难以保证快速收敛；而连续控制更新在实际应用中可能导致资源浪费。因此，需要一种既能加快收敛又能减少控制更新频率的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的静态事件触发牛顿型极值搜索策略有效平衡了收敛性能与控制能耗，适用于对实时性要求较高的优化控制场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a static event-triggered control strategy for multivariable Newton-based extremum seeking. The proposed method integrates event-triggered actuation into the Newton-based optimization framework to reduce control updates while maintaining rapid convergence to the extremum. Unlike traditional gradient-based extremum seeking, where the convergence rate depends on the unknown Hessian of the cost function, the proposed approach employs a dynamic estimator of the Hessian inverse, formulated as a Riccati equation, enabling user-assignable convergence rates. The event-triggering mechanism is designed to minimize unnecessary actuation updates while preserving stability and performance. Using averaging theory, we establish local stability results and exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the unknown extremum point. Additionally, numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach over gradient-based and continuously actuated Newton-based extremum seeking, showing improved convergence rates and reduced control update frequency, leading to more efficient implementation in real-time optimization scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在库存不是预先提供而是通过外生随机补货过程逐渐到达的在线线性规划（OLP）模型，提出了适用于三种主要分布情形的新算法，并给出了相应的遗憾度分析，实现了接近完整的最优遗憾界刻画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OLP模型假设初始预算或资源已知且固定，但在许多实际操作场景中（如电商履约、易腐供应链和可再生能源系统），资源是逐步积累的，初始库存较小甚至为零。因此需要建立更符合现实的模型来处理不确定性和持续缺货风险。

Method: 针对补货型OLP问题，设计了适用于有界分布、有限支撑分布和连续支撑非退化分布三种情形的新算法；其中对于连续支撑情况采用两阶段‘积累-转化’策略，并结合新的遗憾分析技术。

Result: 在有界分布下实现\(\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})\)遗憾，在有限支撑非退化情况下达到\(\mathcal{O}(\log T)\)，并证明退化情形下存在\(Ω(\sqrt{T})\)下界；在连续支撑非退化情况下实现\(\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)\)遗憾，接近经典OLP的性能。实验表明新算法优于直接迁移的经典方法。

Conclusion: 本文建立了更贴近实际应用的补货型OLP框架，揭示了不同分布条件下最优遗憾界的本质差异，填补了现有理论与现实运营场景之间的差距，为相关领域提供了有效的算法工具和理论支持。

Abstract: We study an online linear programming (OLP) model in which inventory is not provided upfront but instead arrives gradually through an exogenous stochastic replenishment process. This replenishment-based formulation captures operational settings, such as e-commerce fulfillment, perishable supply chains, and renewable-powered systems, where resources are accumulated gradually and initial inventories are small or zero. The introduction of dispersed, uncertain replenishment fundamentally alters the structure of classical OLPs, creating persistent stockout risk and eliminating advance knowledge of the total budget.
  We develop new algorithms and regret analyses for three major distributional regimes studied in the OLP literature: bounded distributions, finite-support distributions, and continuous-support distributions with a non-degeneracy condition. For bounded distributions, we design an algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For finite-support distributions with a non-degenerate induced LP, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret, and we establish an $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for degenerate instances, demonstrating a sharp separation from the classical setting where $\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret is achievable. For continuous-support, non-degenerate distributions, we develop a two-stage accumulate-then-convert algorithm that achieves $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$ regret, comparable to the $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret in classical OLPs. Together, these results provide a near-complete characterization of the optimal regret achievable in OLP with replenishment. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms and demonstrate their advantages over natural adaptations of classical OLP methods in the replenishment setting.

Motivation: 为了加速非凸优化中信赖域方法的收敛，同时避免频繁计算精确梯度或函数值，研究者希望在不依赖函数值的情况下引入方差缩减技术以提升稳定性与效率。

Method: 提出一种基于SVRG的随机信赖域算法，仅依赖随机梯度信息，自适应调整信赖域半径，并结合梯度估计与半径控制参数进行迭代更新。

Result: 算法在期望意义下收敛到一阶平稳点，达到了与SVRG类方法相当的迭代和样本复杂度，实验表明该方法在多个机器学习任务上优于SGD和Adam，且对批量大小和内循环长度敏感。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效结合了信赖域框架与SVRG技术，无需函数值评估即可实现快速收敛，兼顾稳定性和性能，适用于大规模非凸优化问题。

Abstract: We propose a stochastic trust-region method for unconstrained nonconvex optimization that incorporates stochastic variance-reduced gradients (SVRG) to accelerate convergence. Unlike classical trust-region methods, the proposed algorithm relies solely on stochastic gradient information and does not require function value evaluations. The trust-region radius is adaptively adjusted based on a radius-control parameter and the stochastic gradient estimate. Under mild assumptions, we establish that the algorithm converges in expectation to a first-order stationary point. Moreover, the method achieves iteration and sample complexity bounds that match those of SVRG-based first-order methods, while allowing stochastic and potentially gradient-dependent second-order information. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating SVRG accelerates convergence, and that the use of trust-region methods and Hessian information further improves performance. We also highlight the impact of batch size and inner-loop length on efficiency, and show that the proposed method outperforms SGD and Adam on several machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: APEX是首个在分段光滑凸优化中同时实现最优收敛速度和终止可验证性的算法，为未知结构下的PWS函数优化提供了理论与实践上的突破。

Abstract: We introduce an optimal and nearly parameter-free algorithm for minimizing piecewise smooth (PWS) convex functions under the quadratic growth (QG) condition, where the locations and structure of the smooth regions are entirely \textit{unknown}. Our algorithm, \apex{} (Accelerated Prox-Level method for Exploring Piecewise Smoothness), is an accelerated bundle-level method designed to adaptively exploit the underlying PWS structure. APEX enjoys optimal theoretical guarantees, achieving a tight oracle complexity bound that matches the lower bound established in this work for convex PWS optimization. Furthermore, APEX generates a verifiable and accurate termination certificate, enabling a robust, almost parameter-free implementation. To the best of our knowledge, APEX is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rate for PWS optimization and provide certificate guarantees.

Abstract: The Whittle index for restless bandits (two-action semi-Markov decision processes) provides an intuitively appealing optimal policy for controlling a single generic project that can be active (engaged) or passive (rested) at each decision epoch, and which can change state while passive. It further provides a practical heuristic priority-index policy for the computationally intractable multi-armed restless bandit problem, which has been widely applied over the last three decades in multifarious settings, yet mostly restricted to project models with a one-dimensional state. This is due in part to the difficulty of establishing indexability (existence of the index) and of computing the index for projects with large state spaces. This paper draws on the author's prior results on sufficient indexability conditions and an adaptive-greedy algorithmic scheme for restless bandits to obtain a new fast-pivoting algorithm that computes the $n$ Whittle index values of an $n$-state restless bandit by performing, after an initialization stage, $n$ steps that entail $(2/3) n^3 + O(n^2)$ arithmetic operations. This algorithm also draws on the parametric simplex method, and is based on elucidating the pattern of parametric simplex tableaux, which allows to exploit special structure to substantially simplify and reduce the complexity of simplex pivoting steps. A numerical study demonstrates substantial runtime speed-ups versus alternative algorithms.

Abstract: The Multi-Layer Thin Films Problem is a materials science problem that aims to enhance the reflectance of a metallic substrate by designing multi-layer coatings composed of different dielectric materials and thicknesses. While previous studies on the problem mostly rely on heuristic approaches and are designed for single wavelength applications, this work addresses the problem using global optimization techniques for multiple wavelengths. We develop an exact nonconvex mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) model to solve this problem. We also develop a mixed-integer second-order cone programming relaxation that has computational advantage over the MIQCP model. Our numerical experiments yield solutions that have average reflectance of 99% over the visible spectrum (380-770 nm) and 95% over the broad spectrum (300-3000 nm).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A cross-dimensional Euclidian space ($Ω$) is proposed for the state space of dimension varying (control) systems. It is shown that the topological structure of $Ω$ is consistent with all $\mathbb{R}^n$, which are the state spaces of each component modes of a dimension varying system. Using the universal metric from $Ω$, the switching laws are assumed to be Lipschitz. Some reasonable conventional switching laws are proposed. Under the topology deduced by the metric on $Ω$ some fundamental properties of dimension varying dynamic systems, such as stability and robustness, are investigated. Then some control problems of dimension varying control systems, including controllability, observability, stabilization, disturbance decoupling, etc. are investigated. Finally, an aggregation approach for large scale hierarchical dimension varying networks is proposed.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method capable of ensuring practical prescribed-time control with guaranteed performance for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of time-varying parametric and dynamic uncertainties, and uncertain control coefficients. Our design consists of two key steps. First, we construct a performance-rate function that freezes at and after a user-specified time T, playing a crucial role in achieving desired precision within prescribed time T and dealing with unmodeled dynamics. Next, based on this function and a sigma-modification strategy in which the leakage term starts to vanish at t > T, we develop an adaptive dynamic surface control framework to reduce control complexity, deal with uncertainties, ensure prescribed performance, practical prescribed-time convergence to a specific region, and ultimately achieve asymptotic convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper addresses biquadratic polynomial programming (BPP), an NP-hard optimization problem closely related to biquadratic tensors. We first establish several necessary and sufficient conditions for the positive semi-definiteness and positive definiteness of biquadratic Cauchy tensors. Leveraging the structured properties of these tensors, we then prove that the BPP and its equivalent multilinear formulation share the same set of optimal solutions. This result allows us to establish the global sequence convergence of the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm via the Kurdyka- Lojasiewicz (KL) property, extending the analysis in [8]. Furthermore, by reformulating the equivalent multilinear problem as an unconstrained optimization model, we enable the analysis of its KL exponent and derive an explicit expression for the convergence rate of PAM. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both biquadratic Cauchy tensors and general biquadratic tensor instances to evaluate the efficiency, stability, and practical performance of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Carbon capture and storage or utilization (CCUS) will play an important role to achieve climate neutrality in many economies. Pipelines are widely regarded as the most efficient means of CO2 transport; however, they are currently non-existent. Policy-makers and companies need to develop large-scale infrastructure under substantial uncertainty. Methods and analyses are needed to support pipeline planning and strategy development. This paper presents an integrated method for designing CO2 pipeline networks by combining energy system scenarios with physical network simulation. Using Germany as a case study, we derive spatially highly resolved CO2 balances to develop a dense-phase CO2 pipeline topology that follows existing gas pipeline corridors. The analyzed system includes existing sites for cement and lime production, waste incineration, carbon users, four coastal CO2 hubs, and border crossing points. We then apply the multiphysical network simulator MYNTS to assess the technical feasibility of this network. We determine pipeline diameters, pump locations, and operating conditions that ensure stable dense-phase transport. The method explicitly accounts for elevation and possible impurities. The results indicate that a system of about 7000 km pipeline length and a mixed normed diameter of DN700 on main corridors and of DN500/DN400 on branches presents a feasible solution to connect most sites. Investment costs for the optimized pipeline system are calculated to be about 17 billion Euros. The method provides a reproducible framework and is transferable to other countries and to European scope.

Abstract: In this letter, we consider a bilevel optimization problem in which the outer-level objective function is strongly convex, whereas the inner-level problem consists of a finite sum of convex functions. Bilevel optimization problems arise in situations where the inner-level problem does not have a unique solution. This has led to the idea of introducing an outer-level objective function to select a solution with the specific desired properties. We propose an iterative method that combines an incremental algorithm with a broadcast algorithm, both based on the principles of federated learning. Under appropriate assumptions, we establish the convergence results of the proposed algorithm. To demonstrate its performance, we present two numerical examples related to binary classification and a location problem.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We consider infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problems governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) and develop a mathematical and computational framework for optimal design of mobile sensor paths in this setting. The proposed path optimal experimental design (path-OED) framework is established rigorously in a function space setting and elaborated for the case of Bayesian c-optimality, which quantifies the posterior variance in a linear functional of the inverse parameter. The latter is motivated by goal-oriented formulations, where we seek to minimize the uncertainty in a scalar prediction of interest. To facilitate computations, we complement the proposed infinite-dimensional framework with discretized formulations, in suitably weighted finite-dimensional inner product spaces, and derive efficient methods for finding optimal sensor paths. The resulting computational framework is flexible, scalable, and can be adapted to a broad range of linear inverse problems and design criteria. We also present extensive computational experiments, for a model inverse problem constrained by an advection-diffusion equation, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Leveraging a recently proposed notion of relative entropy in general probabilistic theories (GPT), we prove a finite de Finetti representation theorem for general convex bodies. We apply this result to address a fundamental question in polynomial optimization: the existence of a convergent outer hierarchy for problems with inequality constraints and analytical convergence guarantees. Our strategy generalizes a quantitative monogamy-of-entanglement argument from quantum theory to arbitrary convex bodies, establishing a uniform upper bound on mutual information in multipartite extensions. This leads to a finite de Finetti theorem and, subsequently, a convergent conic hierarchy for a wide class of polynomial optimization problems subject to both equality and inequality constraints. We further provide a constructive rounding scheme that yields certified interior points with controlled approximation error. As an application, we express the optimal GPT value of a two-player non-local game as a polynomial optimization problem, allowing our techniques to produce approximation schemes with finite convergence guarantees.

Abstract: We propose a penalty-based smoothing framework for convex nonsmooth functions with a supremum structure. The regularization yields a differentiable surrogate with controlled approximation error, a single-valued dual maximizer, and explicit gradient formulas. We then study an accelerated inertial dynamic with vanishing damping driven by a time-dependent regularized function whose parameter decreases to zero. Under mild integrability and boundedness conditions on the regularization schedule, we establish an accelerated $\mathcal{O}(t^{-2})$ decay estimate for the regularized residual and, in the regime $α>3$, a sharper $o(t^{-2})$ decay together with weak convergence of trajectories to a minimizer of the original nonsmooth problem via an Opial-type argument. Applications to multiobjective optimization (through Chebyshev/max scalarization) and to distributionally robust optimization (via entropic regularization over ambiguity sets) illustrate the scope of the framework.

Abstract: Controlling the $\mathcal W_\infty$ Wasserstein distance by the $\mathcal W_p$ Wasserstein distance is interesting both for theorical and numerical applications. A first paper on this problem was written several years ago [3]. Some year later [14] framed it in the same inequality for more general costs which increase with the distance. In this paper, we prove this type of inequality for optimal transport problems with pointwise cost which is a decreasing function of the distance. We show, in particular, that there is a general framework that encompasses all the cases above.

Abstract: In this article, we are concerned about the velocity tracking optimal control problem for 3D critical convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations defined on a simply connected bounded domain $\mathbb{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\mathrm{C}^2$-boundary $\partial\mathbb{D}$. The control is introduced through an external force. The objective is to optimally minimize a velocity tracking cost functional, for which the velocity vector field is oriented towards a target velocity. Most importantly, we are concerned about the first-order necessary optimality conditions for above-mentioned optimal control problem which is the main challenging task of this article. To overcome the difficulties related to the differentiability of the control-to-state mapping, consequence of the lack of regularity of the state variable on bounded domains, we first establish some intermediate optimality conditions and then pass to the limit.

Abstract: An integer program is called ideal if its continuous relaxation coincides with its convex hull allowing the problem to be solved as a continuous program and offering substantial computational advantages. Proving idealness analytically can be extraordinarily tedious -- even for small formulations -- such proofs often span many pages of intricate case analysis which motivates the development of automated verification methods. We develop a general-purpose framework for certifying idealness in Mixed Binary Linear Programs (MBLPs), formulating the verification problem as a linear program when the data is fixed and as a nonconvex quadratic program when the data is parametric. We apply this framework to study several formulations of the rectangle packing problem that are conjectured to be pairwise-ideal, obtaining computational proofs where analytic proofs were previously unknown or impractical. As our second contribution, we introduce and model a novel generalization of the rectangle packing problem that enforces edge clearances between selected rectangles. We present both existing and novel MBLP formulations which arise from different encodings of the underlying disjunctive constraints. We perform some computational experiments on these formulations under a strip-packing objective to determine the importance of pairwise-idealness in practice.

TL;DR: 本研究以传统几何布朗运动（GBM）模型为基准，评估其在加密货币组合风险建模中的适用性，发现其在厚尾、非高斯的加密市场中存在局限性，但仍可作为后续高级模型开发的基准。

Motivation: 为加密货币机构投资构建可靠的风险建模框架，需先确立传统模型的基准表现，以指导后续更先进模型的开发。

Method: 采用最大似然估计和基于历史协方差Cholesky分解的关联蒙特卡洛模拟，对多资产加密货币组合（XRP, SOL, ADA）应用几何布朗运动（GBM）模型，并构建最小方差投资组合（MVP），同时与股票组合（AAPL, TSLA, NVDA）进行对比分析。

Conclusion: 尽管GBM模型在刻画加密货币收益分布上存在不足，但其相对稳定的表现在本研究中被确立为理想的基准，为后续改进模型提供了必要的参照标准。

Abstract: The integration of cryptocurrencies into institutional portfolios necessitates the adoption of robust risk modeling frameworks. This study is a part of a series of subsequent works to fine-tune model risk analysis for cryptocurrencies. Through this first research work, we establish a foundational benchmark by applying the traditional industry-standard Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. Popularly used for non-crypto financial assets, GBM assumes Lognormal return distributions for a multi-asset cryptocurrency portfolio (XRP, SOL, ADA). This work utilizes Maximum Likelihood Estimation and a correlated Monte Carlo Simulation incorporating the Cholesky decomposition of historical covariance. We present our stock portfolio model as a Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP). We observe the model's structural shift within the heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian cryptocurrency environment. The results reveal limitations of the Lognormal assumption: the calculated Value-at-Risk at the 5% confidence level over the one-year horizon. For baselining our results, we also present a holistic comparative analysis with an equity portfolio (AAPL, TSLA, NVDA), demonstrating a significantly lower failure rate. This performance provides conclusive evidence that the GBM model is fundamentally the perfect benchmark for our subsequent works. Results from this novel work will be an indicator for the success criteria in our future model for crypto risk management, rigorously motivating the development and application of advanced models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于算子的高斯空间随机场建模方法，将边界和界面条件显式纳入统计模型，结合变分理论与椭圆偏微分方程框架，实现了对协方差结构、克里金插值及域缩减的统一描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地统计学在欧几里得域上通过变差函数或协方差核编码空间依赖性，但难以处理复杂几何域和内部界面；本文旨在建立一个能显式包含边界和传输条件的统一统计建模框架。

Method: 基于强制性二次能量泛函，利用变分理论推导出精确的精度-协方差对应关系，并通过SPDE-GMRF范式将边界和界面条件作为模型组成部分，使用Dirichlet-to-Neumann算子和Schur补进行域约简与边界映射。

Result: 建立了边界和界面影响下的协方差建模体系，表明变差函数是Green算子的导出二次泛函，提出了通过表面惩罚项建模界面的方法，并实现了硬约束条件下的克里金预测。

Conclusion: 该算子框架使边界和界面效应在协方差建模与预测中得以显式表达，为复杂域上的空间统计提供了兼具理论严谨性与计算可行性的新工具。

Abstract: Classical geostatistics encodes spatial dependence by prescribing variograms or covariance kernels on Euclidean domains, whereas the SPDE--GMRF paradigm specifies Gaussian fields through an elliptic precision operator whose inverse is the corresponding Green operator. We develop an operator-based formulation of Gaussian spatial random fields on bounded domains and manifolds with internal interfaces, treating boundary and transmission conditions as explicit components of the statistical model. Starting from coercive quadratic energy functionals, variational theory yields a precise precision--covariance correspondence and shows that variograms are derived quadratic functionals of the Green operator, hence depend on boundary conditions and domain geometry. Conditioning and kriging follow from standard Gaussian update identities in both covariance and precision form, with hard constraints represented equivalently by exact interpolation constraints or by distributional source terms. Interfaces are modelled via surface penalty terms; taking variations produces flux-jump transmission conditions and induces controlled attenuation of cross-interface covariance. Finally, boundary-driven prediction and domain reduction are formulated through Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators and Schur complements, providing an operator language for upscaling, change of support, and subdomain-to-boundary mappings. Throughout, we use tools standard in spatial statistics and elliptic PDE theory to keep boundary and interface effects explicit in covariance modeling and prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管观察性研究、实验设计（DoE）和随机对照试验（RCTs）等方法已经塑造了现代科学实践，但它们在不同领域的相对有效性和实用性却缺乏系统性的探究。因此，需要一种形式化的元评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 定义了评估空间及其结构化表示，提出AxiaBench基准，对十个常用评估方法在八个代表性应用领域中进行大规模定量比较；同时评估了来自前期评估学研究的全空间分层抽样方法的表现。

Result: 分析揭示了一个基本局限：现有方法无法在多样化场景中同时实现准确性和效率，尤其是DoE和观察性设计与真实世界基准存在显著偏差；全空间分层抽样方法在所有测试领域中 consistently 优于以往方法。

Conclusion: 本研究将元评估确立为一个独立的科学研究对象，提供了推进计算与实验研究中可信评估的概念基础和实用工具集。

Abstract: Evaluation is the foundation of empirical science, yet the evaluation of evaluation itself -- so-called meta-evaluation -- remains strikingly underdeveloped. While methods such as observational studies, design of experiments (DoE), and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shaped modern scientific practice, there has been little systematic inquiry into their comparative validity and utility across domains. Here we introduce a formal framework for meta-evaluation by defining the evaluation space, its structured representation, and a benchmark we call AxiaBench. AxiaBench enables the first large-scale, quantitative comparison of ten widely used evaluation methods across eight representative application domains. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation: no existing method simultaneously achieves accuracy and efficiency across diverse scenarios, with DoE and observational designs in particular showing significant deviations from real-world ground truth. We further evaluate a unified method of entire-space stratified sampling from previous evaluatology research, and the results report that it consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tested domains. These results establish meta-evaluation as a scientific object in its own right and provide both a conceptual foundation and a pragmatic tool set for advancing trustworthy evaluation in computational and experimental research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种贝叶斯框架，用于在连续时间下联合建模成本和事件时间，以解决观察性数据中非随机治疗分配、行政审查和不规则医疗访问带来的挑战，适用于高风险早期子宫内膜癌的辅助放疗成本效益分析。

Motivation: 现有成本效益分析方法在处理时间依赖性混杂、行政审查和不规则随访时存在局限，尤其是在连续时间决策背景下，传统离散时间模型可能导致信息损失和零膨胀问题。

Result: 模拟结果显示该方法在不同审查水平下具有良好的有限样本性能，优于离散时间与全参数方法；应用于SEER-Medicare数据表明，子宫切除术后六个月内启动辅助放疗对高风险早期子宫内膜癌患者具有成本效益。

Conclusion: 所提出的贝叶斯框架能更准确地估计因果可解释的成本效益指标，适用于复杂真实世界数据中的动态治疗策略评估。

Abstract: Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) compare the costs and health outcomes of treatment regimes to inform medical decisions. With observational claims data, CEAs must address nonrandom treatment assignment, administrative censoring, and irregularly spaced medical visits that reflect the continuous timing of care and treatment initiation. In high-risk, early-stage endometrial cancer (HR-EC), adjuvant radiation is initiated at patient-specific times following hysterectomy, causing confounding between treatment and outcomes that can evolve with post-surgical recovery and clinical course. Most existing CEA methods use point-treatment or discrete-time models. However, point-treatment approaches break down with time-varying confounding, while discrete-time models bin continuous time, expand the data into a person-period format, and can induce zero-inflation by creating many intervals with no cost-accruing events. We propose a Bayesian framework for CEAs with sequential decision-making that jointly models costs and event times in continuous time, accounts for administrative censoring, and supports dynamic treatment regimes with minimal parametric assumptions. We use Bayesian g-computation to estimate causally interpretable cost-effectiveness measures, including net monetary benefit, and to compare regimes through posterior contrasts. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method in simulations across censoring levels and compare it against discrete-time and fully parametric alternatives. We then use SEER-Medicare data to assess the cost-effectiveness of initiating adjuvant radiation therapy within six months following hysterectomy among HR-EC patients.

Motivation: 现有RMT-IF方法为非参数型，假设协变量无关的删失且不适用于集群随机试验，限制了其效率和应用范围。为此，需发展更灵活、稳健且适用于复杂设计的新估计方法。

Method: 基于增强逆概率加权框架，结合阶段特异性结果回归与处理组别删失模型，构建双重稳健估计量；进一步扩展至CRT，定义集群层面与个体层面的平均RMT-IF估计目标，并利用jackknife法进行方差估计。

Result: 所提方法在模拟研究中表现出良好的有限样本性能，能有效处理内生集群大小和群内相关性，并在两个随机试验实例中得到验证。

Conclusion: 本文提出的双重稳健RMT-IF估计框架适用于个体和集群随机试验，具有更强的适用性和稳健性，为多状态生存数据提供了可靠的治疗效应评估工具。

Abstract: Progressive multi-state survival outcomes are common in trials with recurrent or sequential events and require treatment effect estimands that remain interpretable without proportional intensity or Markov assumptions. The restricted mean time in favor of treatment (RMT-IF) extends the restricted mean survival time to ordered multi-state processes and provides such an interpretable estimand. However, existing RMT-IF methods are nonparametric, assume covariate-independent censoring for independent observations, and do not accommodate cluster-randomized trials (CRTs), limiting both efficiency and applicability. We develop a class of doubly robust estimators for RMT-IF under right censoring using an augmented inverse-probability weighting framework that combines stage-specific outcome regression with arm-specific censoring models, yielding consistency when either nuisance model is correctly specified. We further extend the framework to CRTs by formalizing both cluster-level and individual-level average RMT-IF estimands to address informative cluster size and by constructing corresponding doubly robust estimators that account for within-cluster correlation. For inference, we employ model-agnostic jackknife variance estimators in both individually randomized and cluster-randomized settings. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate finite-sample performance, and the methods are illustrated using two randomized trial examples.

Motivation: 尽管协变量调整在统计学文献中有广泛研究，但现有软件在易用性和遵循最佳实践方面仍存在不足，亟需一个符合FDA推荐标准且易于使用的工具。

Method: 开发了两个R包RobinCar和RobinCar2，支持多种协变量调整方法，包括ANCOVA、ANHECOVA、G-computation（结合广义线性模型和机器学习）、PROCOVA(TM)中的超协变量调整，以及针对生存数据的协变量调整log-rank检验和风险比估计。

Conclusion: 通过对AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 175数据的应用，证明RobinCar和RobinCar2具有良好的用户友好性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Purpose: Covariate adjustment is a powerful statistical technique that can increase efficiency in clinical trials. Recent guidance from the U.S. FDA provided recommendations and best practices for using covariate adjustment. However, there has existed a gap between the extensive statistical literature on covariate adjustment and software that is easy to use and abides by these best practices.
  Methods: We have developed the RobinCar Family, which is comprised of RobinCar and RobinCar2. These two R packages enable covariate-adjusted analyses for continuous, discrete, and time-to-event outcomes that follow best practices. For continuous and discrete outcomes, the functions in the RobinCar Family facilitate traditional forms of covariate adjustment such as ANCOVA as well as more recent approaches like ANHECOVA, G-computation with generalized linear models and machine learning models, and adjustment for a super-covariate (as in PROCOVA(TM)). Functions for time-to-event outcomes implement the covariate-adjusted log-rank test, the stratified covariate-adjusted log-rank test, and the marginal covariate-adjusted hazard ratio. The RobinCar Family is supported by the ASA Biopharmaceutical Section Covariate Adjustment Scientific Working Group.
  Results: We provide an accessible overview of the covariate-adjusted statistical methods, and describe how they are implemented in RobinCar and RobinCar2. We highlight important usage notes for clinical trial practitioners.
  Conclusion: We apply RobinCar and RobinCar2 functions by analyzing data from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 175, demonstrating that they are straightforward and user-friendly.

Abstract: Small area estimation (SAE) plays a central role in survey statistics and epidemiology, providing reliable estimates for domains with limited sample sizes. The multivariate Fay-Herriot model has been extensively used for this purpose, because it enhances estimation accuracy by borrowing strength across multiple correlated variables. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian extension of the multivariate Fay-Herriot model that enables flexible, component-specific shrinkage of the random effects. The proposed approach employs global-local priors formulated through a sandwich mixture representation, allowing adaptive regularization of each element of the random-effect vectors. This construction yields greater robustness and prevents excessive shrinkage in areas exhibiting strong underlying signals. In addition, we incorporate spatial dependence into the model to account for geographical correlation across small areas. The resulting spatial multivariate framework simultaneously exploits cross-variable relationships and spatial structure, yielding improved estimation efficiency. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and an empirical application to real survey data.

Abstract: Clustering multivariate data is a pervasive task in many applied problems, particularly in social studies and life science. Model-based approaches to clustering rely on mixture models, where each mixture component corresponds to the kernel of a distribution characterizing a latent sub-group. Current methods developed within this framework employ multivariate distributions built under the assumption of independence among variables given the cluster allocation. Accordingly, possible dependence structures characterizing differences across groups are not directly accounted for during the clustering process. In this paper we consider multivariate categorical data, and introduce a model-based clustering method which employs graphical models as a tool to encode dependencies between variables. Specifically, we consider a Dirichlet Process mixture of categorical graphical models, which clusters individuals into groups that are homogeneous in terms of dependence (graphical) structure and allied parameters. We provide full Bayesian inference for the model and develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme for posterior analysis. Our method is evaluated through simulations and applied to real case studies, including the analysis of genomic data and voting records. Results reveal the merits of a graphical model-based clustering, in comparison with approaches that do not explicitly account for dependencies in the multivariate distribution of variables.

Abstract: We study various types of consistency of honest decision trees and random forests in the regression setting. In contrast to related literature, our proofs are elementary and follow the classical arguments used for smoothing methods. Under mild regularity conditions on the regression function and data distribution, we establish weak and almost sure convergence of honest trees and honest forest averages to the true regression function, and moreover we obtain uniform convergence over compact covariate domains. The framework naturally accommodates ensemble variants based on subsampling and also a two-stage bootstrap sampling scheme. Our treatment synthesizes and simplifies existing analyses, in particular recovering several results as special cases. The elementary nature of the arguments clarifies the close relationship between data-adaptive partitioning and kernel-type methods, providing an accessible approach to understanding the asymptotic behavior of tree-based methods.

Abstract: Bayesian model comparison implements Occam's razor through its sensitivity to the prior. However, prior-dependence makes it important to assess the influence of plausible alternative priors. Such prior sensitivity analyses for the Bayesian evidence are expensive, either requiring repeated, costly model re-fits or specialised sampling schemes. By exploiting the learned harmonic mean estimator (LHME) for evidence calculation we decouple sampling and evidence calculation, allowing resampled posterior draws to be used directly to calculate the evidence without further likelihood evaluations. This provides an alternative approach to prior sensitivity analysis for Bayesian model comparison that dramatically alleviates the computational cost and is agnostic to the method used to generate posterior samples. We validate our method on toy problems and a cosmological case study, reproducing estimates obtained by full Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and nested sampling re-fits. For the cosmological example considered our approach achieves up to $6000\times$ lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Material Fingerprinting是一种高效、稳定的材料模型发现策略，避免了传统优化带来的问题，且在无监督实验数据上得到验证，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Material Fingerprinting is a lookup table-based strategy to discover material models from experimental measurements, which completely avoids the need to solve an optimization problem. In an offline phase, a comprehensive database of simulated material responses, so-called material fingerprints, is generated for a predefined experimental setup. This database can then be used repeatedly in the online phase to discover material models corresponding to experimentally measured observations. To this end, the experimentally measured fingerprint is compared with all fingerprints in the database to identify the closest match. The primary advantage of this strategy is that it does not require solving a continuous optimization problem. This avoids the associated computational costs as well as issues of ill-posedness caused by local minima in non-convex optimization landscapes. Material Fingerprinting has been successfully demonstrated for supervised datasets consisting of stress-strain pairs, as well as for unsupervised datasets involving full-field displacements and net reaction forces. However, to date, there is no experimental validation for the latter approach which is the objective of this work.

Abstract: This letter proposes a physics-aware multi-modal contrastive learning framework designed to transform complex seismic wavefields into human-readable physical representations. Traditional data-driven inversion methods often focus on pixel-wise mapping, which lacks physical grounding and interpretability. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that jointly aligns seismic shot gathers, subsurface velocity models, and explicit physical descriptors (e.g., mean velocity and gradients) in a shared latent space. By introducing these descriptors as a third modality, our approach encourages the learned embeddings to capture intrinsic geological semantics rather than superficial signal correlations. Experiments on the OpenFWI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves robust seismic-to-velocity retrieval but also preserves meaningful physical semantics, enabling cross-modal inference of interpretable attributes. This representation-centric perspective provides a flexible foundation for expert-guided subsurface characterization.

### [50] [A Unified Framework for Scalable and Robust Paper Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14402)
*Michael Cui,Chenxin Dai,Yixuan Even Xu,Fei Fang*

Main category: cs.SI

Conclusion: RAMP框架能够高效地处理大规模会议中的论文分配问题，兼顾质量、多样性和抗策略性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Assigning papers to reviewers is a central challenge in the peer-review process of large academic conferences. Program chairs must balance competing objectives, including maximizing reviewer expertise, promoting diversity, and enhancing robustness to strategic manipulation, but it is challenging to do so at the modern conference scale.
  Existing algorithmic paper assignment approaches either fail to address all of these goals simultaneously or suffer from poor scalability. To address the limitation, we propose Robust Assignment via Marginal Perturbation (RAMP), a unified framework for large-scale peer review. Our approach formulates a linearized perturbed-maximization objective with soft constraints that flexibly balance assignment quality, diversity, and robustness while maintaining runtime efficiency. We further introduce an attribute-aware sampling procedure that converts fractional solutions into integral assignments and improves the diversity and robustness of the final assignment. On datasets with over 20,000 papers and 20,000 reviewers, RAMP runs in under 20 minutes, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效克服了非遗传性带来的挑战，显著提升了求解最大γ-准团问题的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Extracting cohesive subgraphs from complex networks is a fundamental task in graph analytics and is essential for understanding biological, social, and web graphs. The edge-based $γ$-quasi-clique model offers a flexible alternative by identifying subgraphs whose edge densities exceed a specified threshold $γ$. However, finding the exact maximum edge-based quasi-clique is computationally challenging, as the problem is NP-hard and lacks the hereditary property. These characteristics limit the effectiveness of conventional pruning methods and the development of efficient reduction rules. As a result, existing algorithms, such as QClique and FPCE, struggle to scale to large graphs. In this paper, we revisit the problem and propose a novel iterative framework that reformulates the problem as a sequence of hereditary subproblems, enabling more effective pruning and reduction strategies and improving the worst-case time complexity. Furthermore, we redesign the iterative process and introduce a novel heuristic to further improve practical efficiency. Extensive experiments on 253 large-scale real-world graphs demonstrate that our proposed algorithm EQC-Pro outperforms existing methods by up to four orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: 分数阶图扩散是一种由记忆驱动的非马尔可夫过程，能在局部探索中发现全局最短路径并偏好高-degree区域，定义了一种新的亚扩散几何。

Abstract: Subdiffusion on graphs is often modeled by time-fractional diffusion equations, yet its structural and dynamical consequences remain unclear. We show that subdiffusive transport on graphs is a memory-driven process generated by a random time change that compresses operational time, produces long-tailed waiting times, and breaks Markovianity while preserving linearity and mass conservation. We prove that Mittag-Leffler graph dynamics admit an exact convex, mass-preserving representation as a superposition of classical heat semigroups evaluated at rescaled times, revealing fractional diffusion as ordinary diffusion acting across multiple intrinsic time scales. This framework uncovers heterogeneous, vertex-dependent memory effects and induces transport biases absent in classical diffusion, including algebraic relaxation, degree-dependent waiting times, and early-time asymmetries between sources and neighbors. These features define a subdiffusive geometry on graphs enabling particles to locally discover global shortest paths while favoring high-degree regions. Finally, we show that time-fractional diffusion arises as a singular limit of multi-rate diffusion.

Motivation: 传统科研绘图依赖引用和元数据，但知识传播主要通过文本内容进行，因此需要一种能直接从文本中重构领域结构的新方法。

Method: 使用大语言模型为每篇论文标注领域特定的三元组（测量、数据类型、研究问题类型），基于共享论文构建加权知识图谱，并采用归一化中介性与连通性比值识别结构性桥梁组件。

Conclusion: 这种基于内容和分类体系的映射方法补充了传统的引文分析，揭示了定义学科领域的方法、数据和问题的动态架构。

Abstract: Scientific fields are often mapped using citations and metadata, despite knowledge being transmitted primarily through content. We introduce an 'inside-out' approach that reconstructs field structure directly from text by representing each paper as a small set of interpretable knowledge components. Using a large language model to induce domain-specific taxonomies and label papers, each publication is encoded as a triplet of measure, data type, and research-question type. These triplets define a knowledge graph with edges weighted by shared papers. Applied to 617 studies on intergenerational wealth mobility, the graph reveals a stable methodological backbone centered on regression-based mobility measures, alongside substantial temporal variation in component recombination. We further utilize normalized betweenness-to-connectivity ratios to identify components and pairings that act as structural bridges disproportionate to their prevalence. This content-derived, taxonomy-driven mapping complements citation-based approaches by exposing the evolving architecture of methods, data, and questions that define a field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统结构主义方法在细读中有效，但难以跨传统、媒介和规模进行比较，需要一种既保持叙事可读性又支持量化分析的形式化工具。

Conclusion: 该框架搭建了结构人类学与文化分析之间的可检验桥梁，使故事既保持解释性又成为可计算、可比较、可证伪的转换对象。

Abstract: Structural approaches to myth and narrative are compelling in close reading but hard to compare across traditions, media, and scale. We propose a formal framework that renders Lévi-Straussian transformation as mathematics while remaining readable as narrative analysis. Variants, superhero continuities, and franchise arcs are modeled as typed rewrite programs on a coupled two-register state $(X,Y)$, abstracting an everyday/social channel and a symbolic/legitimation channel. The canonical formula becomes coherence data: a natural transformation $η:U\Rightarrow V$ between update endofunctors, where $U$ updates each register in place and $V$ performs a swap+inversion. Context is internalized by operator choice, turning naturality into a corpus-facing type check: failures diagnose mis-specified oppositions or illegal transport; successes witness coherent structural models. Order effects are summarized by a five-value invariant (Key). We apply the method to 80 narratives (20 folktales, 20 religious myths, 20 superheroes, 20 franchises), each encoded as $(a,b,x,y)$ with a Key. 59/80 (74\%) explicitly name a normative constraint in $y$ (law, taboo, contract, prophecy), supporting the two-register abstraction. The result is a testable bridge between structural anthropology and cultural analytics: stories remain interpretable yet become transportable objects for computation, comparison, and falsifiable constraints on transformation.

Motivation: 应对外国信息操纵与干扰（FIMI）在多社会维度和信息空间中的复杂挑战，解决现有DISARM框架在社交媒体规模下难以操作化的问题。

Method: 构建了一个多智能体AI管道，各专用智能体协同工作，自动检测可疑的操纵行为，并将其透明地映射到标准DISARM分类体系中。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了大规模社交媒体环境下FIMI分析的可扩展性和透明度，增强了多国联盟在信息丰富环境中的态势感知与数据互操作能力。

Abstract: The interoperability of data and intelligence across allied partners and their respective end-user groups is considered a foundational enabler to the collective defense capability--both conventional and hybrid--of NATO countries. Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to the characterization of threats, sustaining situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further led to the decreasing cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop a multi-agent pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors, and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluated the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis, providing a direct contribution to enhancing the situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media and information-rich settings.

Conclusion: QBS为模拟和实现多种非厄米现象提供了有效平台，开启了非厄米量子效应研究的新路径。

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a rapidly advancing field of research, revealing a range of novel phenomena and potential applications. Traditional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically simulated by constructing asymmetric couplings or by introducing dissipation and gain to realize non-Hermitian systems. The quadratic bosonic system (QBS) with squeezing interaction is intrinsically Hermitian; however, its dynamical evolution matrix in both real and momentum spaces is non-Hermitian. Based on this, applying a field-operator transformation xp to the dynamical evolution matrix yields quadrature nonreciprocal transmission between the x and p operators. This nonreciprocal characteristic can be utilized in signal amplifiers. On the other hand, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework in momentum space, one can observe non-Hermitian topological phenomena such as point-gap topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect, both induced by spectra with nonzero winding numbers. Additionally, QBS can be employed to realize non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm cages and to extend non-Bloch band theory. Previous studies in non-Hermitian physics have largely concentrated on classical systems. The influence of non-Hermitian properties on quantum effects remains a key issue awaiting exploration and has evolved into a research direction at the interface of non-Hermitian and quantum physics.

Conclusion: 基于机器学习设计的光子电路为实现高安全性且实用的设备无关量子密钥分发提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols enable two distant parties to communicate with information-theoretically proven secrecy. However, these protocols are generally vulnerable to potential mismatches between the physical modeling and the implementation of their quantum operations, thereby opening opportunities for side channel attacks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD addresses this problem by reducing the degree of device modeling to a black-box setting. The stronger security obtained in this way comes at the cost of a reduced noise tolerance, rendering experimental demonstrations more challenging: so far, only one experiment based on trapped ions was able to successfully generate a secret key. Photonic platforms have however long been preferred for QKD thanks to their suitability to optical fiber transmission, high repetition rates, readily available hardware, and potential for circuit integration. In this work, we assess the feasibility of DIQKD on a photonic circuit recently identified by machine learning techniques. For this, we introduce an efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound the conditional von Neumann entropy and develop a finite-statistics analysis that takes into account full outcome statistics. Our analysis shows that the proposed optical circuit is sufficiently resistant to noise to make an experimental realization realistic.

Motivation: 探索随机和双随机控制门电路中的动力学行为，理解其关联特性如何在复杂微观动态下保持简单性。

Method: 通过理论分析证明随机和双随机控制门导致两点时空关联函数几乎处处为零，并讨论多点关联的约束条件及自关联的衰减特性。

Result: 两点关联函数仅在相同位点作用时非零；多点关联中两个最右侧算符必须作用于同一位置；自关联通常呈指数衰减且趋于系统尺寸相关的极小值。

Conclusion: 尽管微观动态复杂，但这类量子系统展现出异常简单的关联结构，属于一类广泛存在的简化关联模型。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of circuits composed of stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates. This type of dynamics arises from quantum circuits with random controlled gates, as well as in stochastic circuits and deterministic classical cellular automata. We prove that stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates lead to two-point spatio-temporal correlation functions that vanish everywhere except when the two operators act on the same site. More generally, for multi-point correlations the two rightmost operators must act on the same site. We argue that autocorrelation, while hard to compute, typically decays exponentially towards a value that is exponentially small in the system size. Our results reveal a broad class of quantum systems that exhibit surprisingly simple correlation structures despite their complex microscopic dynamics.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文探讨了超光速变换（SpTs）与有限信息之间的不相容性，提出一个否定性定理：允许SpTs的理论必须包含无限信息，从而导致确定性本体。因此，由SpTs引起的表观不确定性仅源于主观无知，而非量子理论中的客观概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 试图澄清超光速变换是否能产生类似量子的不确定性，并探究其在有限信息条件下的合理性。

Method: 基于自然假设推导出一个否定性定理，分析超光速变换与有限信息共存的可能性。

Result: 证明超光速变换与有限信息无法共存；任何容纳SpTs的理论必须允许无限信息内容，导致确定性而非真正的量子式随机性。

Conclusion: 由超光速变换引起的不确定性并非量子意义上的客观随机，而是源于主观信息不足的表象，因此不能等同于量子力学的根本不确定性。

Abstract: Quantum theory is widely regarded as fundamentally indeterministic, yet classical frameworks can also exhibit indeterminism once infinite information is abandoned. At the same time, relativity is usually taken to forbid superluminal signalling, yet Lorentz symmetry formally admits superluminal transformations (SpTs). Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quantum one. Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers. Thus, any apparent indeterminism arising from superluminal transformations reflects only probabilities arising from subjective ignorance, unlike the objective nature of probabilities in quantum theory, indicating that the claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not quantum.

Abstract: We present QDK/Chemistry, a software toolkit for quantum chemistry workflows targeting quantum computers. The toolkit addresses a key challenge in the field: while quantum algorithms for chemistry have matured considerably, the infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution remains fragmented. QDK/Chemistry provides this infrastructure through a modular architecture that separates data representations from computational methods, enabling researchers to compose workflows from interchangeable components. In addition to providing native implementations of targeted algorithms in the quantum-classical pipeline, the toolkit builds upon and integrates with widely used open-source quantum chemistry packages and quantum computing frameworks through a plugin system, allowing users to combine methods from different sources without modifying workflow logic. This paper describes the design philosophy, current capabilities, and role of QDK/Chemistry as a foundation for reproducible quantum chemistry experiments.

Method: 基于二维altermagnets体系，结合晶体对称性CnT，理论分析垂直磁场下Casimir能量的取向依赖性和扭矩行为。

Result: 发现轴对称磁场可诱导出非对称Casimir能量并产生连续变化、随磁场强度平方增长的扭矩；该扭矩具有独特的温度和距离依赖性，与传统材料不同。

Conclusion: 时间反演对称性破缺是调控Casimir扭矩大小和符号的有效途径，altermagnets为研究真空量子效应提供了新平台。

Abstract: Casimir torque is conventionally associated with explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, arising from material dielectric anisotropy, geometric asymmetry, or externally applied fields that themselves break rotational invariance. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism: an axially symmetric magnetic field can generate a Casimir torque by inducing an axially asymmetric Casimir energy - and can even reverse the torque's sign. Focusing on two-dimensional altermagnets, we show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane - while preserving in-plane rotational symmetry - activates an orientation-dependent vacuum interaction through the combined crystalline symmetry $\mathrm{C_n T}$ inherent to altermagnetic order. The resulting torque emerges continuously and scales quadratically with the magnetic field strength. We further analyze its temperature and distance dependence, revealing scaling behaviors that are qualitatively different from those found in uniaxial bulk materials. Our results identify time-reversal symmetry breaking as a powerful route for engineering both the sign and strength of Casimir torque and establish altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring phenomena driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations.

Conclusion: ITPP为在Pauli基中直接模拟虚时间动力学提供了有效方法，并为统一框架下模拟开放量子系统动力学提供了新路径。

Abstract: We extend the Pauli Propagation framework to simulate imaginary time evolution. By deriving explicit update rules for the propagation of Pauli operators under imaginary time evolution generated by Pauli strings, we introduce an imaginary time Pauli Propagation (ITPP) algorithm for approximating imaginary time dynamics directly in the Pauli basis. This approach enables the computation of thermal and ground-state properties while retaining the key computational advantages of Pauli Propagation. Benchmarking ITPP on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model demonstrates that truncation provides a controlled trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, while also revealing challenges associated with operator growth under imaginary time evolution. Finally, combining imaginary time and real-time Pauli Propagation naturally suggests a pathway toward simulating open quantum system dynamics within a unified framework.

Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is the task of identifying at least one state from a known set that was not used in the preparation of a quantum system. In particular, a given set of quantum states is said to admit state exclusion if there exists a measurement such that, for each state in the set, some measurement outcome rules it out with certainty. However, state exclusion is not always possible in the single-copy setting. In this paper, we investigate whether access to multiple identical copies enables state exclusion. We prove that for any set of three or more pure states, state exclusion becomes possible with a finite number of copies. We further show that the required number of copies may be arbitrarily large -- in particular, for every natural number $N$, we construct sets of states for which exclusion remains impossible with $N$ or fewer copies.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-qubit open quantum system, in particular the two-qubit spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime, coupled to two thermal bosonic baths under non-Markovian and non-equilibrium conditions. Two complementary approaches, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and Reaction Coordinate Mapping (RCM), are employed to examine various coupling regimes between the qubits and their respective baths. The dynamical features of the model and the impact of the tunneling amplitude on quantum coherence of the system are probed using the $l_1$-norm of coherence. The model is further shown to have non-Markovian evolution. The nontrivial task of calculating entropy production in the strong-coupling regime is performed using auxiliary density operators in HEOM. Motivated by the realization of a quantum thermal device in the strong-coupling regime, the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of the system is investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the heat and spin currents and the tunneling amplitude is probed.

Abstract: We formulate a deterministic algorithm for preparing a general $U(1)$-eigenstate of a spin-$s$ chain of length $n$. These states consist of linear combinations of computational basis states $|\vec{m}\rangle$ of $n$ qudits, each with $(2s+1)$ levels and $s= 1/2, 1, 3/2, \ldots$, whose ditstrings $\vec{m}$ have a fixed digit sum. Exploiting a Gray code for bounded integer compositions, whose consecutive ditstrings obey the Gray property, the quantum state is prepared by applying corresponding ``Gray gates.'' We use this algorithm to prepare exact eigenstates of integrable spin-$s$ XXX Hamiltonians.

Abstract: An increase in the number of control lines between the quantum processors and the external electronics constitutes a major bottleneck in the realization of large-scale quantum computers. Frequency-division multiplexing is expected to enable multiple qubits to be controlled through a single microwave cable; however, interference from off-resonant microwave tones hinders precise qubit control. Here, we propose an active interference suppression method for frequency-division-multiplexed simultaneous gate operations. We demonstrate that deliberate incorporation of off-resonant microwave tones improves the accuracy of single-qubit gates. Specifically, we find that by incorporating off-resonant orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal microwave tones, the gate infidelity decreases proportionally to the inverse square of the number of microwave tones. Furthermore, we show that fast oscillations neglected under the rotating wave approximation degrade gate fidelity, and that this degradation can be mitigated through optimized frequency allocation. Our approach is simple yet effective for improving the performance of frequency-division-multiplexed quantum gates.

Motivation: 传统基于非平衡Franson型干涉仪的方法在测量高维光子时间到达态时面临扩展性差和需要主动相位稳定的问题，且仅限于相位-only叠加测量，难以满足大规模量子技术的需求。

Abstract: The temporal degree-of-freedom of light is incredibly powerful for modern quantum technologies, enabling large-scale quantum computing architectures and record key-rates in quantum key distribution. However, the generalized measurement of large and complex quantum superpositions of the time-of-arrival of a photon remains a unique experimental challenge. Conventional methods based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, requiring multiple cascaded devices and active phase stabilization. In addition, these are limited by construction to a restricted set of phase-only superposition measurements. Here we show how the coupling of spatial and temporal information inside a single multi-mode fiber can be harnessed to program completely generalized measurements for high-dimensional superpositions of photonic time-bin. Using the multi-spectral transmission matrix of the fiber, we find special sets of spatial modes that experience distinct dispersive delays through the fiber. By exciting coherent superpositions of these spatial modes, we engineer the equivalent of large, unbalanced multi-mode interferometers inside the fiber and use them to perform high-quality measurements of arbitrary time-bin superpositions in up to dimension 11. The single fiber functions as a scalable, common-path interferometer for time-bin qudits that significantly eases the experimental overheads of standard approaches based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers, serving as an essential tool for quantum technologies that harness the temporal properties of light.

TL;DR: 本文研究了量子叠加态的物理实现障碍，指出在无法确定相位约定的情况下无法构造相干叠加。作者提出了“重叠可确定性”概念，并证明了存在能概率性生成叠加态的完全正映射当且仅当其定义域是重叠可确定的。这一结果统一了现有的不可叠加定理，并表明一旦获得全局相位信息，将导致诸如超光速通信、快速搜索突破等根本性后果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上认为量子叠加是态矢量的线性组合，但实际上物理量是射线（秩一投影算符），存在相位规范自由度。这使得对两个独立制备的未知纯态进行相干叠加成为操作上的难题。因此需要明确在何种条件下可以实现这种叠加。

Method: 通过引入相位约定和‘重叠可确定性’的概念，形式化分析了能够概率性产生叠加态的完全正迹非增映射的存在条件，并建立了其与重叠可确定性的等价关系。

Result: 证明了一个非零完全正迹非增映射能够概率性地在其定义域上产生叠加态，当且仅当该定义域是重叠可确定的。这一结论统一了现代各种不可叠加结果，并解释了少数成功协议为何可行——依赖于额外信息提供的缺失资源。同时发现，若允许普遍访问此类固定相位的重叠，则会导致克隆、超光速信号传递以及Grover搜索下界崩溃等后果。

Conclusion: 实现未知态的相干叠加的关键在于获取足够的相位参考信息；缺乏这种信息时原则上不可能完成任务。而一旦具备全局相位参考，则会破坏现有量子理论的基本限制，引发基础性和计算复杂性层面的重大变化。

Abstract: Quantum superposition is often phrased as the ability to add state vectors. In practice, however, the physical quantity is a ray (a rank-one projector), so each input specifies only a projector and leaves a gauge freedom in the phases of its vector representatives. This becomes a real operational barrier when one asks for a device that, given two independently prepared unknown pure states, outputs a coherent state proportional to a prescribed linear combination. We identify the missing ingredient as not probabilistic but phase-like. One needs a physical scenario that fixes a single phase convention on the relevant set of rays, so that the overlaps become well defined complex numbers. Thus, we formalize this through phase conventions and a single notion -- dubbed as "overlap-determinability." Our main theorem gives an exact equivalence: A nonzero completely positive trace-nonincreasing map that probabilistically produces superposition on a domain exists if and only if that domain is overlap-determinable. This unifies modern no-superposition results and characterizes the exceptional yes-go protocols, which succeed precisely when side information supplies the required missing resource. We then show that granting universal access to such convention-fixed overlaps destabilizes the familiar foundational and computational constraints. It enables forbidden transformations akin to quantum cloning and yields super-luminal signaling. It would also permit reflections about unknown states, leading to exponentially fast overlap amplification and a collapse of Grover's search lower bound to a logarithmic query complexity.

Abstract: Fidelity estimation is a critical yet resource-intensive step in testing quantum programs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where the required number of measurements is difficult to predefine due to hardware noise, device heterogeneity, and transpilation-induced circuit transformations. We present QuFid, an adaptive and noise-aware framework that determines measurement budgets online by leveraging circuit structure and runtime statistical feedback. QuFid models a quantum program as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and employs a control-flow-aware random walk to characterize noise propagation along gate dependencies. Backend-specific effects are captured via transpilation-induced structural deformation metrics, which are integrated into the random-walk formulation to induce a noise-propagation operator. Circuit complexity is then quantified through the spectral characteristics of this operator, providing a principled and lightweight basis for adaptive measurement planning. Experiments on 18 quantum benchmarks executed on IBM Quantum backends show that QuFid significantly reduces measurement cost compared to fixed-shot and learning-based baselines, while consistently maintaining acceptable fidelity bias.

Abstract: We compare different circuits implementing distributed versions of quantum computations, using entangled pairs only, and using distributed fan-out operations (using GHZ states). We highlight the advantages of using distributed fan-out operations in terms of reductions in circuit depth and (possibly) entanglement resources. We note that distributed fan-out operations (or notably, distributed GHZ states) could be a ``primitive'' building block for distributed quantum operations in the same way as entangled pairs are, if distributed GHZ states could be realized efficiently.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a blended dynamics framework for open quantum networks with diffusive couplings. The network consists of qubits interconnected through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and consensus-like diffusive interactions. Such networks commonly arise in spontaneous emission processes and non-Hermitian quantum computing, and their evolution follows a Lindblad master equation. Blended dynamics theory is well established in the classical setting as a tool for analyzing emergent behaviors in heterogeneous networks with diffusive couplings. Its key insight is to blend the local dynamics rather than the trajectories of individual nodes. Perturbation analysis then shows that, under sufficiently strong coupling, all node trajectories tend to stay close to those of the blended system over time. We first show that this theory extends naturally to the reduced-state dynamics of quantum networks, revealing classical-like clustering phenomena in which qubits converge to a shared equilibrium or a common trajectory determined by the quantum blended reduced-state dynamics. We then extend the analysis to qubit coherent states using quantum Laplacians and induced graphs, proving orbit attraction of the network density operator toward the quantum blended coherent dynamics, establishing the emergence of intrinsically quantum and dynamically clustering behaviors. Finally, numerical examples validate the theoretical results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Understanding the thermal behavior of quantum many-body pure states is one of the most fundamental issues in quantum thermodynamics. It is widely known that typical pure states yield vanishing work, just as thermal states do, when one restricts to local operations that cannot access correlations among subsystems. However, it remains unclear whether this equivalence to thermal states persists under LOCC (local operations and classical communication), where classically accessible correlations can be exploited for work extraction. In this work, we establish criteria for determining whether many-body pure states remain equivalent to thermal states even under LOCC, and show that this thermal equivalence is governed by their multipartite quantum correlation structure. We show that states with asymptotically maximal multipartite entanglement, such as Haar-random states, cannot yield extensive work under LOCC, whereas some states with limited multipartite entanglement, such as constant-degree graph states, allow extensive work extraction despite being locally indistinguishable from thermal states. Thus, our work provides a refined operational notion of thermal equivalence beyond the traditional local regime, which is becoming increasingly important due to the recent expansion of experimentally accessible operations.

Abstract: Eigenvalue transformations appear ubiquitously in scientific computation, ranging from matrix polynomials to differential equations, and are beyond the reach of the quantum singular value transformation framework. In this work, we study the efficiency of quantum algorithms based on contour integral representation for eigenvalue transformations from both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretically, we establish a complete complexity analysis of the contour integral approach proposed in [Takahira, Ohashi, Sogabe, and Usuda. Quant. Inf. Comput., 22, 11\&12, 965--979 (2021)]. Moreover, we combine the contour integral approach and the sampling-based linear combination of unitaries to propose a quantum algorithm for estimating observables of eigenvalue transformations using only $3$ additional qubits. Practically, we design contour integral based quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation, matrix polynomials, and solving linear ordinary differential equations, and show that the contour integral algorithm can outperform all the existing quantum algorithms in the case of solving asymptotically stable differential equations.

Abstract: Nonlocal light-matter interactions with giant atoms in high-dimensional environments are not only fundamentally intriguing for testing quantum electrodynamics beyond the dipole approximation but also crucial for building high-dimensional quantum networks and engineering multipartite entangled states. Given the enigmatic and largely uncharted collective signatures exhibited by multiple giant atoms within two-dimensional optical baths, we delve into their nonperturbative collective dynamics within the single-excitation subspace, focusing on the case where they are coupled to a common two-dimensional photonic reservoir and employing a resolvent operator approach. We demonstrate that precisely engineered atomic arrangements lead to unconventional quantum dynamics, featuring non-Markovianity-induced beats and long-lived bound states in the continuum, thereby providing a versatile platform for implementing two-dimensional quantum memory. Phenomenologically, we observe the emergence of exotic photon emission patterns in both two- and three-dimensional (3D) baths. The emission directions are shown to be precisely controllable on demand through exact phase engineering of the coupling parameters, enabling a highly efficient chiral light-matter interface. Moreover, our generalization to a 3D bath reveals that coherent dipole-dipole interactions can survive despite the coupling to a continuum of modes, a finding that challenges conventional wisdom regarding decoherence.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous estimation of the three parameters characterizing a pair of incoherent optical sources in the sub-Rayleigh regime, enabling super-resolved scene characterization. Using spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) with two demultiplexers--one deliberately shifted--we determine separations well below the diffraction limit and achieve sensitive joint estimation of separation, centroid, and relative brightness over a broad range of scene configurations in a single experimental setting. We benchmark our performance using Fisher-information-based Cramér-Rao bounds, and discuss the corresponding quantum limits. We investigate two complementary scenarios: a realistic case with slightly non-identical sources, and an idealized case of indistinguishable sources.

Abstract: Negating the Measurement Independence assumption (MI) is often referred to as the `third way' to account for the experimental violation of Bell's inequality. However, this route is generally viewed as ludicrously contrived, implying some implausible conspiracy where experimenters are denied the freedom to choose measurement settings as they like. Here, a locally realistic model of quantum physics is developed (Rational Mechanics - RaQM - based on a gravitational discretisation of Hilbert Space) which violates MI without denying free will. Crucially, RaQM distinguishes experimenters' ability to freely choose measurement settings to some nominal accuracy, from an inability to choose exact settings, which were never under their control anyway. In RaQM, Hilbert states are necessarily undefined in bases where squared amplitudes and/or complex phases are irrational numbers. Such `irrational' bases correspond to conceivable but necessarily impossible counterfactual measurements, and are shown to play a ubiquitous role in the analysis of both single- and entangled-particle quantum physics. It is concluded that violation of Bell inequalities can be understood with none of the strange processes historically associated with it. Instead, using concepts from (non-classical) $p$-adic number theory, we relate RaQM to Bohm and Hiley's concept of a holistic Machian-like Undivided Universe. If this interpretation of Bell's Theorem is correct, building more and more energetic particle accelerators to probe smaller and smaller scales, in the search for a theory which synthesises quantum and gravitational physics and hence a Theory of Everything, may be a fruitless exercise.

Abstract: The Mollow triplet is the definitive spectral signature of an optically dressed quantum emitter. We predict that for emitters coupled to localized phonons, this signature is not confined to the zero-phonon line. Under a strong resonant drive, we show that Mollow triplets are strikingly replicated on the associated phonon sidebands -a surprising result, given that phonon sidebands are typically viewed as incoherent, inelastic scattering pathways. These vibronic Mollow triplets are a direct fingerprint of dynamically generated dressed states that hybridize the emitter's electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. We develop a scalable analytical formalism to model this effect in complex, multi-mode molecular systems, such as dibenzoterrylene. Our work provides the precise driving conditions for observing these novel spectral features, establishing a new signature of coherence in vibronically coupled systems.

Abstract: The space $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ of SU(2)-invariant four-valent tensors, also known as intertwiners, can be understood as the quantum states of a tetrahedron in Euclidean space with fixed areas. In loop quantum gravity, they are states of the smallest "atom of space" with non-zero volume. At the same time they correspond to four-party tensor product states invariant under global rotations. We consider the multipartite entanglement of states in $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ using the recently proposed entropic fill.
  Numerically evaluating entropic fill in the case of equal spins between $1/2$ and $11$, we find that the distributions of entanglement are very different for intertwiners as compared to generic tensors, and for coherent intertwiners as compared to generic ones. The peak in the distribution seems to be at the highest entanglement for generic intertwiners and at the lowest for generic tensors, but in terms of average entanglement, the roles are switched: average entanglement is highest in arbitrary tensors and lower in intertwiners, at least in the regime of large $j$. We also find that entanglement depends on the geometric data of coherent intertwiners in a complicated way.

Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) offers a promising paradigm for photonic quantum computing, but its implementation requires the generation of specific non-Gaussian resource states. While continuous-variable encodings such as the highly complex (GKP) states have been widely studied, the much simpler binomial codes offer an experimentally accessible alternative, though they demand a distinct set of operational tools. Here, we present a toolkit for MBQC using optical binomial codes, detailing a cavity-QED protocol for conditional generation of cluster states and the implementation of Pauli measurements. Our work proposes the first steps for existing optical atom-cavity architectures to lay the groundwork for their use in quantum computation.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the backbone of simulations of many natural phenom- ena, for example in climate modeling, material science, and even financial markets. The application of physics-informed neural networks to accelerate the solution of PDEs is promising, but not compet- itive with numerical solvers yet. Here, we show how quantum computing can improve the ability of physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations. For this, we develop hybrid networks consisting of quantum circuits combined with classical layers and systematically test them on various non linear PDEs and boundary conditions in comparison with purely classical networks. We demonstrate that the advantage of using quantum networks lies in their ability to achieve an accurate approximation of the solution in substantially fewer training epochs, particularly for more complex problems.

Abstract: Superconducting qubit networks (SQNs) embedded in a low-dissipative resonator is a promising device allowing one not only to establish the collective quantum dynamics on a macroscopic scale but also to greatly enhance the sensitivity of detectors of microwave photons. A quantum ac Stark effect provided by coupling between an SQN and microwave photons of a resonator, leads to a strong nonlinear interaction between photons. Here, we present a two-tone spectroscopy experiment in which a set of 10 superconducting flux qubits is coupled to the input R- resonator and the output T- transmission line. An external microwave pump field close to the resonance frequency populates macroscopically the resonator mode as a Bose-Einstein condensate, while a second probe beam scans the resonances referred also as Bogoliubov-like excitations. The corresponding excitation frequency measured from the transmission coefficient, |S21(f)| displays an abrupt change of the resonant dip position once the power of the pump field overcomes a critical value Pcr. This sharp shift occurs in a narrow region of pump frequencies, and can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. It is a signature of bistability of the photon number inside the resonator, in agreement with theory.

Abstract: In an entanglement summoning task, a set of distributed, co-operating parties attempt to fulfill requests to prepare entanglement between distant locations. The parties share limited communication resources: timing constraints may require the entangled state be prepared before some pairs of distant parties can communicate, and a restricted set of links in a quantum network may further constrain communication. Building on earlier work, we continue the characterization of entanglement summoning. We give an if and only if condition on entanglement summoning tasks with only bidirected causal connections, and provide a set of sufficient conditions addressing the most general case containing both oriented and bidirected causal connections. Our results rely on the recent development of entanglement sharing schemes.

Abstract: Recently, Jordan et al. (Nature, 2025) introduced a novel quantum-algorithmic technique called Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) for solving specific combinatorial optimization problems associated with classical codes. They presented a constraint-satisfaction problem called Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) and showed that, for this problem, a DQI algorithm running in polynomial time can satisfy a larger fraction of constraints than any known polynomial-time classical algorithm.
  In this work, we propose several improvements to the DQI algorithm, including sidestepping the quadratic-time Dicke state preparation. Given random access to the input, we show how these improvements result in a nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for the OPI problem. Concurrently and independently with this work, Khattar et al. (arXiv:2510:10967) also construct a nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for OPI using slightly different techniques.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Efficient generation of radiation in the mid- and far- infrared relies primarily on lasers and coherent nonlinear optical phenomena driven by lasers. This wavelength range lacks of luminescent devices because the spontaneous emission rate becomes much longer than the nonradiative energy relaxation processes and therefore emitters have to count on stimulated emission produced by linear or non-linear optical gain. However, spontaneous emission is not a fundamental property of the emitter. By engineering metamaterials composed of arrays of nano-emitters into microcavities coupled to patch antennas, we have demonstrated mid-infrared electroluminescent devices emitting a collimated beam with excellent spatial properties and a factor 100 increase in the collected power, compared to standard devices. Our results illustrate that by reshaping the photonic environment around emitting dipoles, as in the Purcell effect, it is possible to enhance the spontaneous emission and conceive efficient optoelectronic light emitting devices that operate close to the thermodynamical equilibrium as LEDs in the visible range.

Abstract: We unveil a temperature bias of the probe in transient quantum thermometry under Markovian dynamics. Specifically, for qubit thermometers evolving under Markovian dynamics, we show that enhanced precision beyond the steady state limit can be achieved if and only if the probe is initially colder than the thermal state corresponding to the bath temperature to be estimated. In contrast, this temperature bias can be lifted when the probe dynamics is non-Markovian. In the non-Markovian regime, both hot and cold probes can simultaneously attain the same transient maximum precision, well above the steady-state value.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管Falicov-Kimball模型已被广泛研究，但关于其连续金属-绝缘体转变中涌现的Mott型量子临界性的微观机制仍缺乏解析理解。

Method: 利用两站点群动力学平均场理论作为输入，在分层Cayley树（Bethe晶格）上构建全解析理论。

Result: 发现密度涨落模式具有来自红外幂律奇异性群自能的反常维度；在零温下，具有玻璃动力学的亚扩散金属态收缩为一个单一点，即Mott型量子临界点。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了对Falicov-Kimball模型中异常量子临界行为的微观解析洞察，揭示了非遍历绝缘体与弱遍历金属之间的临界行为本质。

Abstract: The Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) is long known to be the simplest model of correlated fermions exhibiting a novel Mott-like quantum critical point (QCP) assocaited with a {\it continuous} MIT in dimensions $D \geq 3$. It is also known to be isomorphic to an {\it annealed} binary-alloy disorder model. Notwithstanding extensive numerical studies for the FKM, analytic insight into the microscopic processes spawning novel Mott-like quantum criticality is scarce. Here, we develop a fully analytic theory for the Mott-like quantum criticality in the FKM on a hierarchical Cayley tree (Bethe lattice) by utilizing a single input from a 2-site cluster-dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). We find that density fluctuation modes acquire anomalous dimensions, originating from infra-red power-law singular cluster self-energies. Interestingly, we uncover, at $T=0$, that this {\it sub-diffusive} metal with glassy dynamics separating a weakly ergodic metal from a non-ergodic insulator shrinks to a single point, namely the Mott-like QCP, at least on the Bethe lattice. We detail the consequences of this anomalous quantum criticality for a range of thermal and dynamical responses in a variety of physical systems that can be effectively modelled by the FKM.

Conclusion: 激子-准空穴束缚态可在无外磁场条件下通过局部电荷耗尽区的残余吸引力形成，为在莫尔TMD系统中实现可调控的复合准粒子及其实验探测提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moiré TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.

Motivation: 轨道磁性是反映固体电子本征性质的纯量子现象，但在相互作用多带系统中其微观描述尚不完整，缺乏适用于关联电子体系的统一理论框架。

Method: 基于Luttinger-Ward泛函和Dyson方程，重构弱磁场下的热力学势，引入非对易坐标的修正“傅里叶”表示，在Moyal代数下实现有效动量空间中的磁场微扰展开。

Result: 导出了完全由零场哈密顿量经自能修正后表达的自发轨道磁化；对于依赖频率的厄米自能，将轨道磁矩和贝里曲率推广至动量-频率空间，并识别出两个由这些量构成的规范不变贡献；在自能不依赖频率时，结果退化为非相互作用系统的几何公式。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算关联多带材料中的轨道磁响应提供了统一基础，实现了对轨道磁性的微观描述在强关联体系中的推广。

Abstract: Orbital magnetism is a purely quantum phenomenon that reflects intrinsic electronic properties of solids, yet its microscopic description in interacting multiband systems remains incomplete. We develop a general quantum many-body framework for orbital magnetic responses based on the Luttinger-Ward functional. Starting from the Dyson equation, we reformulate the thermodynamic potential in a weak magnetic field and construct a controlled expansion in powers of $B$ applicable to correlated electron systems. A key technical advance is a modified ``Fourier'' representation using noncommutative coordinates, which allows the thermodynamic potential to be expressed in an effective momentum space where the magnetic field acts perturbatively. This formulation makes analytic progress possible within the Moyal algebra. As an application, we derive the spontaneous orbital magnetization and express it entirely in terms of the zero-field Hamiltonian renormalized by the self-energy. For frequency-dependent but Hermitian self-energies, we generalize the orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvature to momentum-frequency space and identify two gauge-invariant contributions built from these quantities. For frequency-independent self-energies the result reduces to the familiar geometric formula for noninteracting systems. This framework provides a unified foundation for computing orbital magnetic responses in correlated multiband materials.

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature properties of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We focus on the highly frustrated regime around $J_2 \approx J_1/2$. The $h$-$T$ phase diagram is investigated with particular emphasis on the finite-temperature transition into the "up-up-up-down" state that is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations and manifests itself as a plateau at one half of the saturation magnetization in the quantum case. We also discuss the enhanced magnetocaloric effect associated to the ground-state degeneracy that arises at the saturation field for $J_2=J_1/2$. For reference, we first study the classical case by classical Monte Carlo simulations. Then we turn to the extreme quantum limit of spin-1/2 where we perform zero- and finite-temperature Lanczos calculations.

Conclusion: 超导的出现是系统有序相被压制的直接结果，压力调控电子关联在相变中起关键作用。

Abstract: CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly identified strongly correlated kagome superconductor, characterized by non-Fermi-liquid behavior at elevated temperatures and intertwined charge- and spin-density-wave order below $T_{DW}\approx 54$K. Under external pressure, this order is suppressed and a superconducting phase emerges. This phase diagram, which closely resembles that of high-$T_c$ superconductors, together with a kagome flat band near the Fermi level and possible altermagnetic order, has motivated extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. To better understand how pressure influences the ordered states, we present a systematic study of the evolution of the electronic properties under applied pressure. Performing DFT+DMFT (density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory) calculations, we uncover a complex interplay between the redistribution of spectral weight in the flat bands and the strength of electronic correlations under pressure. Our results further strengthen the interpretation that pressure effectively weakens electronic correlations through enhanced orbital hybridization. This, in turn, strongly suggests that superconductivity emerges as a direct consequence of the suppression of the system's ordered phase.

Abstract: We study Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions for triangular-lattice U(1) Dirac spin liquids in a Zeeman field, where we allow the U(1) gauge field to develop a gauge flux, resulting in (spin-split) spinon Landau levels. We find that at a given magnetization, the optimal candidate state has a finite flux chosen such that the spinon filling lies in a $|C|=1$ Landau-level gap: it gives the lowest variational energy and the smallest energy variance within our correlation-matrix reconstruction for local Heisenberg-type models. By symmetry, we argue that the finite gauge flux results in a non-zero (staggered) scalar spin chirality, as also numerically observed, and further find that the $|C|=1$ state exhibits dominant quasi-long-ranged $120^\circ$ magnetic correlations. Studying the next-to-optimal wavefunction with a $|C|=2$ Landau-level gap, we observe unusual spin-nematic correlations. Our results may provide guidance for analyzing the magnetic-field response of DSL candidate materials and offer numerical diagnostics that can connect to the underlying theory of spinons coupled to an emergent U(1) gauge field.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host a variety of fractionalized particles. In Kitaev's paradigmatic honeycomb model a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ fractionalizes into $Z_2$ flux due to emergent $Z_2$ gauge field and matter Majorana fermions. Although these excitations have well-defined dynamics in the integrable limit, their direct experimental identification is notoriously challenging: realistic materials inevitably host additional symmetry-allowed interactions that break integrability and hybridize gauge and matter sectors, while magnetic fields, which are often required to suppress competing order and stabilize a putative QSL regime, further entangle the responses of different fractionalized quasiparticles and may even drive the system into field-induced spin-liquid phases that are not adiabatically connected to the integrable limit. A prominent example is the quantum Majorana metal, in which the distinct dynamics of fractionalized Majorana fermions can become directly visible in scattering. This report highlights recent progress on these related questions: in which field-stabilized QSL regimes and nearby emergent phases, and under what conditions, can the response of a specific fractionalized quasiparticle be isolated and positively understood, thereby clarifying the existence and the experimental scope of putative spin liquids? We review the progress on these questions across Abelian, non-Abelian, and an emergent quantum phases under magnetic field that are not perturbatively connected to the integrable limit. We connect these field-induced dynamical phenomena to concrete experimental observables, relevant for neutron scattering, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and pump-probe spectroscopy that are capable of resolving specific types of fractionalized particles, including Majoranas and $Z_2$ fluxes.

Abstract: Within the Hubbard model, the ionization energy and electron affinity of the icosahedral C60 fullerene are calculated in the static fluctuation approximation. A graphical representation of the chemical potential equation is first obtained. The correlation function, which describes the transitions of π-electrons from one fullerene site to the nearest site, and the thermodynamic average, which characterizes the probability of detecting two π-electrons with oppositely oriented spin projections on a single fullerene site, are then calculated. The theoretically obtained values for the ionization energy of 7.57 eV and the electron affinity of 2.67 eV coincide with the experimentally observed values and demonstrate that, during photoionization or another process leading to either the acquisition or loss of a π-electron, the fullerene responds to external perturbations as a single system of strongly correlated π-electrons.

Result: 计算表明，在所考虑的具体情况下，只有弱铁磁态下的altermagnet才能在无外加磁场时表现出反常霍尔效应。

Conclusion: altermagnets中的反常霍尔效应受其对称性和磁结构调控，仅在弱铁磁配置中实现零场下的非零响应。

Abstract: Altermagnets are metals with a momentum-dependent spin splitting of electron bands due to a specific crystal structure, which is invariant under time reversal only in combination with rotations and reflections. The developed phenomenological approach makes it possible to obtain a spectrum of electron bands in an altermagnet corresponding to an antiferromagnet with the same symmetry. The anomalous Hall effect is an inherent property of substances whose electron band dispersion is characterized by the Berry curvature. Calculations of the Berry curvature were performed for altermagnet analogs of collinear antiferromagnet, weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnet, and ferrimagnetic structures. It was shown that in the specific cases under consideration, the anomalous Hall effect in the absence of an external magnetic field is possible only in the state of a weak ferromagnet.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the fidelity of orbital optimization in variational Monte Carlo to improve diffusion Monte Carlo results on correlated magnetic systems, using CrSBr as a model system. We compare the performance of different optimization methods, showing that stochastic reconfiguration is a robust and reliable optimizer. We show that short range Jastrow factors are important for improving diffusion Monte Carlo, regardless of the quality of orbitals. Large active spaces are required to converge the variational energy, but ulitmately orbital optimization produces worse diffusion Monte Carlo energies when compared to standard orbitals from density functional theory. We show that this increased bias is due to larger locality errors from the use of pseudopotentials, while the fixed-node error is actually improved by using orbital optimization. Additionally, for observables other than energy, orbital optimization produces a systematically smaller mixed-estimator bias. Ultimately, we believe orbital optimization provides a reliable method to improve variational and pure fixed-node energies as well as lower mixed-estimator bias.

Abstract: We study discrete random fields $\{X_t: t\in \mathbb{Z}^d\}$ parameterized on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. For a fixed threshold $u$, the excursion set $\{t \in \mathbb{Z}^d : X_t > u\}$ decomposes into connected components or clusters, whose size, defined as the number of lattice points they contain, are random. This paper investigates the probability distribution of these cluster sizes. For stationary random fields, we derive exact expressions for the cluster size distribution. To address nonstationary settings, we introduce a peak-based cluster size distribution, which characterizes the distribution of cluster sizes conditional on the presence of a local maximum above $u$. This formulation provides a tractable alternative when exact cluster size distributions are analytically inaccessible. The proposed framework applies broadly to Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields, relying only on their joint dependence structure. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for quantifying spatial extent in discretely sampled data, with applications to medical imaging, geoscience, environmental monitoring, and other scientific areas where thresholded random fields naturally arise.

Abstract: We study a noisy linear observation model with an unknown permutation called permuted/shuffled linear regression, where responses and covariates are mismatched and the permutation forms a discrete, factorial-size parameter. This unknown permutation is a key component of the data-generating process, yet its statistical investigation remains challenging due to its discrete nature. In this study, we develop a general statistical inference framework on the permutation and regression coefficients. First, we introduce a localization step that reduces the permutation space to a small candidate set building on recent advances in the repro samples method, whose miscoverage decays polynomially with the number of Monte Carlo samples. Then, based on this localized set, we provide statistical inference procedures: a conditional Monte Carlo test of permutation structures with valid finite-sample Type-I error control. We also develop coefficient inference that remains valid under alignment uncertainty of permutations. For computational purposes, we develop a linear assignment problem computable in polynomial time complexity and demonstrate that its solution asymptotically converges to that of the conventional least squares problem with large computational cost. Extensions to partially permuted designs and ridge regularization are also discussed. Extensive simulations and an application to Beijing air-quality data corroborate finite-sample validity, strong power to detect mismatches, and practical scalability.

Abstract: Statistical data depth plays an important role in the analysis of multivariate data sets. The main outcome is a center-outward ordering of the observations that can be used both to highlight features of the underlying distribution of the data and as input to further statistical analysis. An important property of data depth is related to symmetric distributions as the point with the highest depth value, the center, coincides with the point of symmetry. However, there are applications in which it is more natural to consider symmetry with respect to a subspace of a certain dimension rather than to a point, i.e. a subspace of dimension zero. We provide a general framework to construct statistical data depths which attain maximum value in a subspace, providing a center-outward ordering from that subspace. We refer to these data depths as central subspace data depths. Moreover, if the distribution is symmetric with respect to a subspace, then the depth is maximized at that subspace. We introduce general notions of symmetry about a subspace for distributions, study the properties of central subspace data depths and provide asymptotic convergence for the corresponding sample versions. Additionally, we discuss connections with projection pursuit and dimension reduction. An application based on custom data fraud detection shows the importance of the proposed approach and strengthens its potential.

*Stefan Schoder*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种用于计算气动声学和耦合场问题中场传递的积分方法，基于有限元法求解声场，并比较了其精度、性能和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高场传递过程中从有限差分网格到有限元网格映射的精度，减少插值和近似误差。

Method: 第一种方法采用高阶高斯积分计算有限元右端项，并利用高阶B样条或拉格朗日函数对有限差分场进行映射；第二种方法使用割胞单元或超级网格结合几何裁剪技术进行积分。

Result: 高阶高斯积分随着B样条插值阶数增加而收敛，且与有限差分结果一致；超级网格方法消除了网格级的插值误差，显著提高了精度，尤其在光滑或强振荡场中表现优异。

Conclusion: 超级网格积分方法在精度上优于传统方法，适用于多种声源项（如类Lighthill源项和扰动对流波动方程源项）的子音速流动问题，具有普适性优势。

Abstract: This work presents two integration methods for field transfer in computational aeroacoustics and in coupled field problems, using the finite element method to solve the acoustic field. Firstly, a high-order Gaussian quadrature computes the finite element right-hand side. In contrast, the (flow) field provided by the finite difference mesh is mapped by higher-order B-Splines or a Lagrangian function. Secondly, the cut-cell or supermesh integration with geometric clipping. For each method, the accuracy, performance characteristics, and computational complexity are analyzed. As a reference, the trapezoidal integration rule was computed from the finite difference results. The high-order quadrature converges as the B-Spline interpolation order increases, and the finite difference results and mesh resolutions are consistent. The supermesh approach eliminates interpolation and approximation errors at the grid-to-mesh level and improves accuracy. This behaviour is universal for smooth or strongly oscillating field quantities, which will be shown in a comparative study between the Lighthill-like source term and the source term of the perturbed convective wave equation for subsonic flows.

Numerical tests validate the theoretical results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效构造全对称正内部（f-SPI）高阶积分规则的新方法，应用于方块、立方体、棱柱和金字塔等参考单元，显著减少了节点数量并达到了更高的代数精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格常用参考单元上的高阶f-SPI积分规则在高次情况下节点数多且稀缺，限制了高阶离散化的效率，因此需要构造更高效的积分规则。

Method: 通过引入可变参数化确保节点位于内部且权重为正，结合高效的Levenberg-Marquardt优化算法，并采用对称性感知的节点约简策略来消除和合并轨道，实现不同对称类型之间的转换。

Result: 所构造的新规则在方块上达到最高77次，在立方体上45次，在棱柱和金字塔上30次，多数次数下使用的节点数少于已有规则，且验证测试显示其精度与现有规则相当。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了f-SPI积分规则的效率和适用范围，为高阶偏微分方程离散化提供了更优的数值积分工具。

Abstract: Fully symmetric positive interior (f-SPI) quadrature rules are key building blocks for high-order discretizations of partial differential equations, yet high-degree rules with few nodes remain scarce on reference elements commonly used in mesh generation. We construct new f-SPI rules on the square, cube, prism, and pyramid by coupling a variable parameterization that enforces positivity and interiority with an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt optimization and a symmetry-aware node-reduction strategy that eliminates and collapses orbits, allowing transitions between symmetry types. The resulting rules achieve degrees up to 77 on the square, 45 on the cube, and 30 on the prism and pyramid, and for most degrees use fewer nodes than previously published f-SPI quadrature rules. Verification tests demonstrate comparable accuracy to existing rules. Complete node and weight data are also provided.

Motivation: 由于强非局域耦合、高维度和内存限制，构建和存储雅可比矩阵往往不可行，因此需要一种高效的显式时间积分方法。

Method: 采用Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) 和 Runge-Kutta-Legendre (RKL) 等超时间步进方法，结合间断Galerkin (DG) 和有限差分法处理扩散方程，并设计了一种新的误差范数用于时间自适应控制。

Conclusion: 该STS框架为高维、大规模陀螺动力学模拟中的扩散算子提供了高效可行的显式时间积分方案，尤其适用于无法使用隐式方法的场景。

Abstract: Super-time-stepping (STS) methods provide an attractive approach for enabling explicit time integration of parabolic operators, particularly in large-scale, higher-dimensional kinetic simulations where fully implicit schemes are impractical. In this work, we present an explicit STS framework tailored for diffusion operators in gyrokinetic models, motivated by the fact that constructing and storing a Jacobian is often infeasible due to strong nonlocal couplings, high dimensionality, and memory constraints. We investigate the performance of several STS methods, including Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and Runge-Kutta-Legendre (RKL) schemes, applied to a diffusion equation discretized using both discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite-difference methods. To support time adaptivity, we introduce a novel error norm designed to more accurately track temporal error arising from DG spatial discretizations, in which degrees of freedom contribute unevenly to the solution error. Finally, we assess the performance of an automatic eigenvalue estimation algorithm for determining the required number of STS stages and compare it against an analytical estimation formula.

We establish the upper semicontinuity of the numerical attractor with respect to the global attractor as the time step tends to zero. Furthermore, we provide finite-dimensional approximations for three types of attractors (global, numerical, and random), and demonstrate the existence of truncated attractors along with their convergence as the dimension of the state space tends to infinity. Finally, we prove the existence of a random attractor and establish the upper semi-continuity both of the global random attractor and the truncated random attractor.

Conclusion: MCFI为非定常高维系统的可扩展反演设计和模型校准提供了有效框架，具有计算高效、自然正则化和物理意义清晰的优势。

Abstract: Inverse problems in computational physics often require matching high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields, leading to prohibitive computational costs and ill-conditioned optimizations. We introduce modal-centric field inversion (MCFI), a paradigm that reformulates inverse problems in the reduced space of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes rather than the full physical state space. By targeting dominant flow structures instead of point-wise field values, MCFI provides a compact, physically meaningful objective that naturally regularizes the inversion and dramatically reduces computational burden. Central to this framework is the differentiable POD: an adjoint-based method that efficiently computes sensitivities of POD modes with respect to model parameters, enabling gradient-based optimization in the modal space. We demonstrate MCFI on a one and two-dimensional modified viscous Burger's equation, optimizing spatially varying coefficients to match target dynamics through mode-matching. The adjoint formulation achieves computational cost independent of parameter dimension, in contrast to finite-difference approaches that scale linearly. MCFI establishes a foundation for scalable inverse design and model calibration in unsteady, high-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We consider adaptive finite element methods (AFEMs) with inexact algebraic solver for second-order symmetric linear elliptic diffusion problems. We formulate and analyze a non-linear and non-symmetric geometric multigrid preconditioner for the generalized preconditioned conjugate gradient method (GPCG) used to solve the arising finite element systems. Moreover, a linear and symmetric variant of the geometric multigrid preconditioner that is suitable for the (standard) preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG) is provided and analyzed. We show that both preconditioners are optimal in the sense that, first, the resulting algebraic solvers admit a contraction factor that is independent of the local mesh size h and the polynomial degree p, and, second, that they can be applied with linear computational complexity. Related to this, quasi-optimal computational cost of the overall adaptive finite element method is addressed. Numerical experiments underline the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a rank-one Riemannian subspace descent algorithm for computing symmetric positive definite (SPD) solutions to nonlinear matrix equations arising in control theory, dynamic programming, and stochastic filtering. For solution matrices of size $n\times n$, standard approaches for dense matrix equations typically incur $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost per-iteration, while the efficient $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ methods either rely on sparsity or low-rank solutions, or have iteration counts that scale poorly. The proposed method entails updating along the dominant eigen-component of a transformed Riemannian gradient, identified using at most $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ power iterations. The update structure also enables exact step-size selection in many cases at minimal additional cost. For objectives defined as compositions of standard matrix operations, each iteration can be implemented using only matrix--vector products, yielding $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ arithmetic cost. We prove an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ iteration bound under standard smoothness assumptions, with improved bounds under geodesic strong convexity. Numerical experiments on large-scale CARE, DARE, and other nonlinear matrix equations show that the proposed algorithm solves instances (up to $n=10{,}000$ in our tests) for which the compared solvers, including MATLAB's \texttt{icare}, structure-preserving doubling, and subspace-descent baselines fail to return a solution. These results demonstrate that rank-one manifold updates provide a practical approach for high-dimensional and dense SPD-constrained matrix equations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Nonclassical symmetries and reductions of polynomial equations and systems of polynomial equations are considered. It is shown that specific polynomial equations having "hidden" symmetries can be reduced to classical symmetric systems of polynomial equations by introducing a new additional variable. It has been established that symmetric systems of polynomial equations of mixed type, consisting of symmetric and anti-symmetric polynomials, can be transformed into simpler systems. A method is presented for solving nonclassical symmetric systems of two polynomial equations that change places when the unknowns are permuted. We study polynomial equations containing the second iteration of a given polynomial, which are reduced to nonclassical symmetric systems of equations. New higher-degree polynomial equations containing free parameters that admit solutions in radicals are found. Three such equations of the sixth and ninth degrees are further used as test problems with parameters for analyzing the capabilities of two leading computer algebra systems. It is shown that currently, the Maple and Mathematica systems do not allow us to efficiently find analytical solutions (in radicals) of polynomial equations with free parameters, but they allow us to obtain numerical solutions of equations for fixed numerical values of the parameters. The results of this work and the proposed test problems with parameters can be used to further improve existing computer algebra systems.

Abstract: The performance of Schwarz Waveform Relaxation is critically dependent on the choice of transmission conditions. While classical absorbing conditions work well for wave propagation, they prove insufficient for damped wave equations, particularly in viscoelastic damping regimes where convergence becomes prohibitively slow. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a more general transmission operator with two free parameters for the one-dimensional damped wave equation. Through frequency-domain analysis, we derive an explicit expression for the convergence factor governing the convergence rate. We propose and compare two optimization strategies (L-infinity and L-2 minimization) for determining optimal transmission parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our optimized approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to standard absorbing conditions, especially for viscoelastic damping cases. The method provides a computationally efficient alternative to exhaustive parameter search while maintaining robust performance across different damping regimes.

Abstract: We present a convergence analysis of the parallel-in-time integration method known as the Parareal algorithm for degenerate differential-algebraic systems arising from quasi-static Biot models, which govern coupled flow and deformation in porous media. The underlying system exhibits a saddle-point structure and degeneracy due to the quasi-static assumption. We extend the Parareal algorithm to this setting and propose three coarse propagators: monolithic, fixed-stress, and multirate fixed-stress schemes. For each, we derive sufficient conditions for convergence and establish explicit time step restrictions that guarantee contractivity of the iteration matrix. Numerical experiments show computational savings accrued by using a parareal solver in multiphysics simulations involving poroelasticity and other coupled systems.

Abstract: We study anomalous localization in a one-dimensional non-Hermitian quasicrystal with a spatially disordered imaginary gauge field. The system is a generalized Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) chain with asymmetric nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings generated by a Bernoulli imaginary gauge field and a quasiperiodic onsite potential. In the standard non-Hermitian AAH limit, the system undergoes a transition from a fully erratic non-Hermitian skin effect (ENHSE) phase to a fully localized phase. We show that the fractal dimension cannot distinguish these phases, whereas the Lyapunov exponent and center-of-mass fluctuations provide sharp diagnostics. This transition is accompanied by a complex-to-real spectral change under periodic boundary conditions and a topological change of the spectral winding number. With next-nearest-neighbor hopping, we uncover an anomalous mobility edge separating Anderson-localized states from ENHSE states, rather than extended states. This mobility edge is captured by an energy-dependent winding number that vanishes in the localized regime. Finally, we propose a dynamical probe based on wave-packet expansion: for typical disorder realizations, the dynamics shows winding-controlled drift and disorder-selected pinning or boundary-wrapping recurrence, while disorder averaging restores Hermitian-like transport. These results offer practical spectral, topological, and dynamical diagnostics of anomalous localization and mobility edges in non-Hermitian quasicrystals.

Abstract: This paper introduces an analog-to-stochastic converter using a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) de- vice for vision chips based on stochastic computation. Stochastic computation has been recently exploited for area-efficient hardware implementation, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders and image processors. However, power-and-area hungry two-step (analog-to-digital and digital-to-stochastic) converters are required for the analog to stochastic signal conversion. To real- ize a one-step conversion, an MTJ device is used as it inherently exhibits a probabilistic switching behavior between two resistance states. Exploiting the device-based probabilistic behavior, analog signals can be directly and area-efficiently converted to stochastic signals to mitigate the signal- conversion overhead. The analog-to-stochastic signal conversion is theoretically described and the conversion characteristic is evaluated using device and circuit parameters. In addition, the resistance variability of the MTJ device is considered in order to compensate the variability effect on the sig- nal conversion. Based on the theoretical analysis, the analog-to-stochastic converter is designed in 90nm CMOS and 100nm MTJ technologies and is verified using a SPICE simulator (NS-SPICE) that handles both transistors and MTJ devices.

TL;DR: 本研究发现了一种大气水汽中的多年代际双极振荡（IBO），该振荡连接北极和南极，解释了过去八十年两极气候演变的差异，并预测未来可能的相位反转将加速南极气候变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为何北极与南极在气候变化上呈现不同步现象，尤其是北极快速变暖而南极响应滞后且不均的问题。

Method: 利用CMIP6的再分析数据、历史模拟和工业化前控制模拟，识别并验证IBO这一内部变率模态的存在及其周期特征。

Result: 发现了具有60~80年准周期的IBO，其在1980年代末的相位转变增强了北极的湿化与变暖，同时抑制了南极的变化；模型预测未来可能发生相位反转，导致南极水汽增加加快。

Conclusion: IBO是极地气候演变的关键内部驱动因子，可能显著影响南半球未来的气候风险，尽管气候模型对极地水汽的模拟仍存在不确定性。

Abstract: Climate change is progressing asynchronously between the Arctic and Antarctic, with important implications for global climate dynamics. While the Arctic has experienced rapid warming and pronounced amplification, the Antarctic has exhibited a delayed and heterogeneous response. Here, we identify an Interdecadal Bipolar Oscillation (IBO) in atmospheric water vapor, a coherent internal mode of variability that connects the two polar regions and helps explain their divergent climate trajectories over the past eight decades. Using reanalysis data alongside historical and pre-industrial control simulations from CMIP6, we demonstrate that the IBO is a robust internal variability mode with a quasi-period of 60 ~ 80 years. This oscillation modulates the background warming signal, with a phase shift in the late 1980s amplifying moistening and warming in the Arctic while concurrently suppressing changes in the Antarctic. Crucially, model projections suggest a possible phase reversal, which could slow water vapor increases in the Arctic while accelerating them in the Antarctic, potentially marking the start of rapid Antarctic climate change. While uncertainties remain in how climate models capture polar water vapor, our findings highlight the IBO as a pivotal driver of polar climate evolution and a potential contributor to emerging climate risks in the Southern Hemisphere.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全通分数阶近似（APF）的交流最优潮流（AC OPF）模型，替代传统三角函数耦合，提升求解效率与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AC OPF因三角函数引起的非凸性和振荡导数导致内点法收敛慢甚至不稳定，需更优的数学表达形式。

Method: 采用全通分数阶近似（APF）替代电压相量间的三角函数项，并引入预旋转技术优化逼近精度区域，保持功率流物理特性与对称性，改善雅可比和海森矩阵条件。

Conclusion: APF OPF提供了一种更利于求解的非凸AC OPF表述方式，在保证物理一致性的同时提升了数值求解性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a fractional approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem based on an all-pass approximation of the exponential power flow kernel. The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF. All code, functions, verification scripts, and generated results are publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/APF-OPF}{GitHub}, along with a README describing how to run and reproduce the experiments.

Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for differential privacy over affine manifolds and validate its usefulness in the contexts of differentially private cloud-based control and average consensus. We consider differential privacy mechanisms for linear queries when the input data are constrained to lie on affine manifolds, a structural property that is assumed to be available as prior knowledge to adversaries. In this setting, the definition of neighborhood adjacency must be formulated with respect to the intrinsic geometry of the manifolds. We demonstrate that such affine-manifold constraints can fundamentally alter the attainable privacy levels relative to the unconstrained case. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which differential privacy can be realized via structured noise injection mechanisms, wherein correlated Gaussian or Laplace noise distributions, rather than i.i.d. perturbations, are calibrated to the dataset. Based on these characterizations, we develop explicit noise calibration procedures that guarantee the tight realization of any prescribed privacy budget with a matching noise magnitude. Finally, we show that the proposed framework admits direct applications to linear dynamical systems ranging from differentially private cloud-based control to privacy-preserving average consensus, all of which naturally involve affine-manifold constraints. The established theoretical results are illustrated through numerical examples.

Result: 证明了卡尔曼滤波器在攻击初始时刻对任意受攻击传感器子集均能最优地增强可检测性；对于一步后和稳态情况，所提出的优化方法能够有效提升攻击检测能力并降低计算复杂度；数值仿真表明该方法在热力系统中具有良好的检测性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的隐秘性感知检测框架能够在保证系统性能的同时，显著提升对隐蔽偏置注入攻击的检测能力，尤其适用于存在噪声干扰的实际控制系统。

Abstract: This paper studies the design of detection observers against stealthy bias injection attacks in stochastic linear systems under Gaussian noise, considering adversaries that exploit noise and inject crafted bias signals into a subset of sensors in a slow and coordinated manner, thereby achieving malicious objectives while remaining stealthy. To address such attacks, we formulate the observer design as a max-min optimization problem to enhance the detectability of worst-case BIAs, which attain a prescribed attack impact with the least detectability evaluated via Kullback-Leibler divergence. To reduce the computational complexity of the derived non-convex design problem, we consider the detectability of worst-case BIAs at three specific time instants: attack onset, one step after attack occurrence, and the steady state. We prove that the Kalman filter is optimal for maximizing the BIA detectability at the attack onset, regardless of the subset of attacked sensors. For the one-step and steady-state cases, the observer design problems are approximated by bi-convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved using alternating optimization and alternating direction method of multipliers. Moreover, more tractable linear matrix inequality relaxations are developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed stealth-aware detection framework is demonstrated through an application to a thermal system.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative offshore solution where oil & gas platform clusters are powered by a wind farm and a hydrogen hub. The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%. The simulations also revealed challenges to achieve self-sufficiency of hydrogen and potential design improvements are suggested.

Abstract: This paper develops an instantaneous-frequency (IF) local estimator calculated with the complex Teager-Kaiser energy operator (CTKEO) and the dynamic-signal identity. The contribution is a novel IF expression that makes the envelope-curvature terms explicit, thus correcting the bias that affects conventional estimators used in power systems. The estimator aligns with complex-frequency (CF) kinematics and admits a geometric interpretation (curvature/torsion) without phase unwrapping. Simulations and data-driven examples demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization formulation to determine optimal operation and procurement plans for achieving a 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) compliance at minimized cost. The system in consideration follows primary energy technologies in Thailand including solar power, battery storage, and a diverse portfolio of renewable and carbon-based energy procurement sources. Unlike existing literature focused on long-term planning, this study addresses near real-time operations using a 15-minute resolution. A novel feature of the formulation is the explicit treatment of CFE compliance as a model parameter, enabling flexible targets such as a minimum percentage of hourly matching or a required number of carbon-free days within a multi-day horizon. The mixed-integer linear programming formulation accounts for uncertainties in load and solar generation by integrating deep learning-based forecasting within a receding horizon framework. By optimizing battery profiles and multi-source procurement simultaneously, the proposed system provides a feasible pathway for transitioning to carbon-free operations in emerging energy markets.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce safety by rendering a prescribed safe set forward invariant. However, standard CBFs are limited to safety constraints with relative degree one, while High-Order CBF (HOCBF) methods address higher relative degree at the cost of introducing a chain of auxiliary functions and multiple class K functions whose tuning scales with the relative degree. In this paper, we introduce a Truncated Taylor Control Barrier Function (TTCBF), which generalizes standard discrete-time CBFs to consider high-order safety constraints and requires only one class K function, independent of the relative degree. We also propose an adaptive variant, adaptive TTCBF (aTTCBF), that optimizes an online gain on the class K function to improve adaptability, while requiring fewer control design parameters than existing adaptive HOCBF variants. Numerical experiments in a relative-degree-six spring-mass system and a cluttered corridor navigation validate the above theoretical findings.
