Prior work characterizing how large language models are used has focused on private, one-on-one interactions. Grok's deployment on X represents a major departure from this setting, with interactions occurring in a public social space. In this paper, we systematically sample three months of interaction data to investigate how, when, and to what effect Grok is used on X. At the platform level, we find that Grok responds to 62% of requests, that the majority (51%) are in English, and that engagement is low, with half of Grok's responses receiving 20 or fewer views after 48 hours. We also inductively build a taxonomy of 10 roles that LLMs play in mediating social interactions and use these roles to analyze 41,735 interactions with Grok on X. We find that Grok most often serves as an information provider but, in contrast to LLM use in private one-on-one settings, also takes on roles related to dispute management, such as truth arbiter, advocate, and adversary. Finally, we characterize the population of X users who prompted Grok and find that their self-expressed interests are closely related to the roles the model assumes in the corresponding interactions. Our findings provide an initial quantitative description of human-AI interactions on X, and a broader understanding of the diverse roles that large language models might play in our online social spaces."}

The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data."}

Then a twist operator is defined to make a connection between a generalized multiple qubit Bell state and a tensor product of two qubit Bell state.

The goal of this paper is to address some of these gaps. First, we study duality theory for entropic VQR and establish strong duality and dual attainment for marginals with possibly unbounded supports. In addition, when all marginals are compactly supported, we show that dual potentials are real analytic. Second, building on our duality theory, when all marginals are Gaussian, we show that entropic VQR has a closed-form optimal solution, which is again Gaussian, and establish the precise approximation rate toward unregularized VQR."}

Such win estimands offer an intuitive approach for prioritizing outcomes by clinical importance. The implementation and interpretation of win estimands is complicated in cluster randomized trials (CRTs), where researchers can target fundamentally different estimands on the individual-level or cluster-level. We numerically demonstrate that individual-pair and cluster-pair win estimands can substantially differ when cluster size is informative: where outcomes and/or treatment effects depend on cluster size. With such informative cluster sizes, individual-pair and cluster-pair win estimands can even yield opposite conclusions regarding treatment benefit. We describe consistent estimators for individual-pair and cluster-pair win estimands and propose a leave-one-cluster-out jackknife variance estimator for inference. Despite being consistent, our simulations highlight that some caution is needed when implementing individual-pair win estimators due to finite-sample bias. In contrast, cluster-pair win estimators are unbiased for their respective targets. Altogether, careful specification of the target estimand is essential when applying win estimators in CRTs. Failure to clearly define whether individual-pair or cluster-pair win estimands are of primary interest may result in answering a dramatically different question than intended."}

Two solvers are implemented: an analog Monte Carlo (AMC) engine and a semi-implicit Milstein SDE solver. Transient benchmarks demonstrate perfect agreement of AMC/SDE means with deterministic solutions, while revealing that the SDE approach underestimates DNP variances in selected regimes, potentially due to the neglect of DNP noise. We further recast reactivity loss due to precursor drift in this stochastic setting and show that its estimator is negatively biased.

Compliance with these regulations is increasingly expected from individual shipping companies, compelling vessel operators to lower the CO2 emissions of their fleets while maintaining economic viability. An important step towards achieving this is performing regular hull and propeller cleaning; however, this entails significant costs. As a result, assessing whether ship performance has declined sufficiently to warrant cleaning from an environmental and economic standpoint is a critical task to ensure both long-term viability and regulatory compliance. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel data-driven dynamic programming approach to optimize vessel cleaning schedules by balancing both environmental and economic considerations. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed methodology based on real-world sensor data from ten tramp trading vessels. The results confirm that over a four-year period, fuel consumption can be reduced by up to 5%, even when accounting for the costs of one or two additional cleaning events."}

Here, we design three sets of experiments targeting synoptic-scale phenomena, interannual variability, and out-of-distribution uniform-warming forcings. We evaluate the Neural General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid model integrating a dynamical core with ML-based component, against observations and physics-based Earth system models (ESMs). At the synoptic scale, NeuralGCM captures the evolution and propagation of extratropical cyclones with performance comparable to ESMs. At the interannual scale, when forced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, NeuralGCM successfully reproduces associated teleconnection patterns but exhibits deficiencies in capturing nonlinear response. Under out-of-distribution uniform-warming forcings, NeuralGCM simulates similar responses in global-average temperature and precipitation and reproduces large-scale tropospheric circulation features similar to those in ESMs. Notable weaknesses include overestimating the tracks and spatial extent of extratropical cyclones, biases in the teleconnected wave train triggered by tropical SST anomalies, and differences in upper-level warming and stratospheric circulation responses to SST warming compared to physics-based ESMs. The causes of these weaknesses were explored."}

In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling.

Furthermore, there is a lack of a unified framework for systematically evaluating and comparing the performance of car-following models to replicate real trajectories. Existing car-following studies often rely on disparate metrics, which limit reproducibility and performance comparability.\n  This study addresses these gaps through two main contributions: (1) the calibration of a diverse set of car-following models using real-world AS trajectory data, including eight machine learning algorithms and two physics-based models; and (2) the introduction of a multi-criteria evaluation framework that integrates measures of prediction accuracy, trajectory stability, and statistical similarity, which provides a generalizable methodology for a systematic assessment of car-following models.\n  Results indicated that the proposed calibrated XGBoost model achieved the best overall performance.

Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry."}

This has been studied extensively under the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) formulation, which reduces the problem to finding some type of Steiner subgraph on a network. Group surveillance like wastewater or aerosol monitoring is a form of mass/pooled testing where samples from multiple individuals are pooled together and tested once for all. While a single negative test clears multiple individuals, a positive test does not reveal the infected individuals in the test pool. We introduce the POOLCASCADEMLE problem in the setting of a network propagation process, where the goal is to find a MLE cascade subgraph which is consistent with the pooled test outcomes. Previous work on reconstruction assumes that the test results are of individuals, i.e., pools of size one, and requires a consistent cascade to connect the positive testing nodes. In POOLCASCADEMLE, a consistent cascade must choose at least one node in each positive pool, adding another combinatorial layer. We show that, under the Independent Cascade (IC) model, POOLCASCADEMLE is NP-hard, and present an approximation algorithm based on a reduction to the Group Steiner Tree problem. We also consider a one-hop version of this problem, in which the disease can spread for one time step after being seeded. We show that even this restricted version is NP-hard, and develop a method using linear programming relaxation and rounding. We evaluate the performance of our methods on real and synthetic contact networks, in terms of missing infection recovery and prevalence estimation.

Traditional methods comply with physical laws but are computationally intensive. Data-driven methods, while opening new avenues for advancement, have yet to incorporate strict physical consistency. The principle of reciprocity is one of the most fundamental physical laws in wave propagation. We introduce the Reciprocity-Enforced Neural Operator (RENO), a transformer-based architecture for modeling seismic wave propagation that hard-codes the reciprocity principle. The model leverages the cross-attention mechanism and commutative operations to guarantee invariance under swapping source and receiver positions. Beyond improved physical consistency, the proposed architecture supports simultaneous realizations for multiple sources without crosstalk issues. This yields an order-of-magnitude inference speedup at a similar memory footprint over an reciprocity-unenforced neural operator on a realistic configuration. We demonstrate the functionality using the reciprocity relation for particle velocity fields under single forces. This architecture is also applicable to pressure fields under dilatational sources and travel-time fields governed by the eikonal equation, paving the way for encoding more complex reciprocity relations."}

We develop a QLSTM Seq2Seq autoencoder in which a depth-1 variational quantum circuit is embedded inside each recurrent gate, shaping the geometry of the learned latent manifold. Evaluated on fourteen rolling S and P 500 windows from 2022 to 2025, the quantum-enhanced encoder produces smoother trajectories, clearer regime transitions, and more stable, sector-coherent clusters than a classical LSTM baseline. These geometric properties support the use of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for downstream portfolio allocation, where both RBF-Graph and RBF-DivMom strategies consistently outperform their classical counterparts in risk-adjusted terms. Analysis across periods shows that compressed manifolds favor concentrated allocation, while dispersed manifolds favor diversification, demonstrating that latent geometry serves as a regime indicator. The results highlight a practical role for shallow hybrid quantum and classical layers in NISQ-era sequence modeling, offering a reproducible pathway for improving temporal embeddings in finance and other data-limited, noise-sensitive domains."}

We develop a broad framework for accounting for and reducing this variance and prove that stratified sampling -- under ideal proportional allocation -- results in an unbiased estimator with a variance that is never worse than naïve sampling (with equality only in degenerate cases).\n  Furthermore, we provide a classical dynamic programme to enable stratification on arbitrary product-form QPDs. Numerical simulations of typical QPDs, such as Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) and Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (PAI), demonstrate constant-factor reductions in overall variance (up to $\\sim 60$--$80\\%$ in an oracle model) and robust $\\sim 10\\%$ savings in the pessimistic single-shot regime. Our results can be applied immediately to reduce the net sampling cost of practically relevant QPDs that are commonly used in near term and early fault-tolerant algorithms without requiring additional quantum resources."}

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian framework to address key challenges in these analyses, including high dimensionality, complex dependence among omics mediators, and non-continuous outcomes. Furthermore, commonly used approaches assume independent mediators or ignore correlations in the selection stage, which can reduce power when mediators are highly correlated. Addressing these challenges leads to a non-Gaussian likelihood and specialized selection priors, which in turn require efficient and adaptive posterior computation. Our proposed framework selects active pathways under generalized linear models while accounting for mediator dependence. Specifically, the mediators are modeled using a multivariate distribution, exposure-mediator selection is guided by a Markov random field prior on inclusion indicators, and mediator-outcome activation is restricted to mediators supported in the exposure-mediator model through a sequential subsetting Bernoulli prior. Simulation studies show improved operating characteristics in correlated-mediator settings, with appropriate error control under the global null and stable performance under model misspecification. We illustrate the method using real-world metabolomics data to study metabolites that mediate the association between adherence to the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score and two cardiometabolic outcomes."}

This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \\times L_t=48^3\\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_π=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications."}

Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping."}

Our target application is the computation of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output transfer functions arising from large-scale discretizations of problems with continuous spectral measures, such as linear time-invariant PDEs on unbounded domains. Traditional Krylov methods, such as Lanczos or conjugate gradients, focus on resolving individual eigenvalues of a dense discretization, while ignoring the underlying continuous spectral measure that these points approximate. We argue that it is more efficient to model the inherent branch cut of the original operator than to exhaustively resolve the artificial point spectrum induced by discretization. We place this problem in a framework, known in the physics literature as the square-root terminator. To overcome its limitations, we formulate a quadratic terminator using Kreĭn--Nudelman semi-infinite strings, with parameters chosen adaptively to maximize relative energy outflow.\n  This approach results in a low-rank modification to the (block) Lanczos matrix, dependent on $\\sqrt{s}$, with an additional $O(n)$ cost. We demonstrate significant error reductions for large-scale self-adjoint PDE discretizations in unbounded domains, including two- and three-dimensional Maxwell's equations in diffusive regimes. The method proves particularly advantageous in computing state-space solutions for wave propagation, specifically for 2D wave and 3D Maxwell's operators. Implicitly replacing the conventional Lanczos spectral decomposition with a representation in terms of the continuous Kreĭn--Nudelman spectrum, we obtain a qualitative improvement in finite-difference approximations, effectively transforming standing-wave artifacts into outgoing propagating waves."}

Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively. These illustrate how dynamical computing can serve as a basis for designing universal logic gates and investigating their out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic performance."}

Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development."}

The former arises from sources observing different, yet potentially overlapping, feature sets, while the latter involves varying signal strengths across subject groups and feature sets. While existing methods perform well with fully observed data or uniform signal strength, their performance degenerates when these two challenges coincide, which is common in practice. To address this, we propose Anchor Projected Principal Component Analysis (APPCA), a general framework for representation learning with structured blockwise missingness that is robust to signal heterogeneity. APPCA first recovers robust group-specific column spaces using all observed feature sets, and then aligns them by projecting shared \"anchor\" features onto these subspaces before performing PCA. This projection step induces a significant denoising effect. We establish estimation error bounds for embedding reconstruction through a fine-grained perturbation analysis. In particular, using a novel spectral slicing technique, our bound eliminates the standard dependency on the signal strength of subject embeddings, relying instead solely on the signal strength of integrated feature sets. We validate the proposed method through extensive simulation studies and an application to multimodal single-cell sequencing data."}

A stratified symmetry operator is a symmetry operator that factorizes into mutually independent subsystem symmetry operators; its stratified anomaly is defined as the collection of anomalies associated with these subsystem operators. We develop a cellular chain complex formalism for stratified anomalies of internal symmetries and show that, in the presence of crystalline symmetries, they give rise to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) constraints. This includes LSM anomalies and SPT-LSM theorems. We apply this framework to modulated $G$ symmetries, which are symmetries whose total symmetry group is ${G_\\mathrm{tot} = G \\rtimes G_\\mathrm{s}}$, with $G_\\mathrm{s}$ the crystalline symmetry group. Notably, a nonzero stratified anomaly within a fundamental domain of $G_\\mathrm{s}$ (e.g., a unit cell) does not always imply an LSM anomaly for modulated symmetries. Instead, the existence of an LSM anomaly also depends on how $G_\\mathrm{s}$ acts on $G$. When $G_\\mathrm{s}$ is the lattice translation group, we find an explicit criterion for when a stratified anomaly causes an LSM anomaly, and classify LSM anomalies using homology groups of $G_\\mathrm{s}$-invariant cellular chains. We illustrate this through examples of exponential and dipole symmetries with stratified anomalies, both in ${(1+1)}$D and ${(2+1)}$D, and construct a stabilizer code model of a modulated SPT subject to an SPT-LSM theorem."}

Based on this equivalence and in combination with the algorithm $\\mathtt{bcirc_z}$-inv, large-scale tests and scalability analysis of the Tikhonov-regularized model are conducted.\n  As a by-product of the analysis, some relevant and straightforward properties of the quaternion $z$-block circulant matrices are provided. As applications, a series of quaternion tensor decompositions under the QT-product and their corresponding $z$-block circulant matrices decompositions are obtained, including the QT-Polar decomposition, the QT-PLU decomposition, and the QT-LU decomposition. Meanwhile, the QT-SVD is rederived based on the relation between $\\mathcal A$ and $\\mathtt{bcirc_z}(\\mathcal A)$. Furthermore, we develop corresponding algorithms and present several large-scale tests and scalability analysis. In addition, applications in video rotation are presented to evaluate several rotation strategies based on the QT-Polar decomposition, which shows the decomposition remains stable and inter-frame consistent while accurately maintaining color reproduction."}

The process is based on the solidification of photopolymer that occurs when a sufficient threshold dose of light-energy is absorbed. In order to create complex shapes, an illumination plan must be designed to force solidification in some desired areas while leaving other regions liquid. Determining an illumination plan can be considered as an optimisation problem where a variety of objective functionals (penalties) can be used. This work considers a selection of penalty functions and their impact on selected printing metrics; linking the shape of penalty functions to ranges of light-energy dose levels in in-part regions that should be printed and out-of-part regions that should remain liquid. Further, the threshold parameters that are typically used to demarcate minimum light-energy for in-part regions and maximum light-energy for out-of-part regions are investigated systematically as design parameters on both existing and new methods. This enables the characterisation of their effects on some selected printing metrics as well as informed selection for default values. This work is underpinned by a reproducible and extensible framework, TVAM Adaptive Illumination Design(TVAM AID), which makes use of the open-source Core Imaging Library(CIL) that is designed for tomographic imaging with an emphasis on reconstruction. The foundation of TVAM AID which is presented here can hence be easily enhanced by existing functionality in CIL thus lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging use of strategies that already exist for reconstruction optimisation."}

The former arises from sources observing different, yet potentially overlapping, feature sets, while the latter involves varying signal strengths across subject groups and feature sets. While existing methods perform well with fully observed data or uniform signal strength, their performance degenerates when these two challenges coincide, which is common in practice. To address this, we propose Anchor Projected Principal Component Analysis (APPCA), a general framework for representation learning with structured blockwise missingness that is robust to signal heterogeneity. APPCA first recovers robust group-specific column spaces using all observed feature sets, and then aligns them by projecting shared \"anchor\" features onto these subspaces before performing PCA. This projection step induces a significant denoising effect. We establish estimation error bounds for embedding reconstruction through a fine-grained perturbation analysis. In particular, using a novel spectral slicing technique, our bound eliminates the standard dependency on the signal strength of subject embeddings, relying instead solely on the signal strength of integrated feature sets. We validate the proposed method through extensive simulation studies and an application to multimodal single-cell sequencing data."}

Existing methods typically rely on either interpretable but inflexible models or highly flexible black-box approaches that sacrifice interpretability; moreover, most impose a single global decision rule across patients. We introduce the Locally Interpretable Individualized Treatment Rule (LI-ITR) method, which combines flexible machine learning models to accurately learn complex treatment outcomes with locally interpretable approximations to construct subject-specific treatment rules. LI-ITR employs variational autoencoders to generate realistic local synthetic samples and learns individualized decision rules through a mixture of interpretable experts. Simulation studies show that LI-ITR accurately recovers true subject-specific local coefficients and optimal treatment strategies. An application to precision side-effect management in breast cancer illustrates the necessity of flexible predictive modeling and highlights the practical utility of LI-ITR in estimating optimal treatment rules while providing transparent, clinically interpretable explanations."}

Given a preference function, we embed the scalarized MOO problem into the value function of a parameterized zero-sum game, whose upper value solves a first-order HJ equation that admits a Hopf-Lax representation formula. For each parameter value, this representation yields an inner minimizer that can be interpreted as an approximate solution to a shifted scalarization of the original MOO problem. Under mild assumptions, the resulting family of solutions maps to a dense subset of the weak Pareto front. Finally, we propose a primal-dual algorithm based on this approach for solving the corresponding optimality system.

Early work established that for spin-polarized electrons confined to the lowest Landau level band, repulsion triggers a charge density wave (CDW) in which electrons 'self-layer' into integer quantum Hall states, while attraction generates a non-Fermi liquid (rather than a superconductor). We revisit this problem with physically motivated deformations -- including generalized local interactions, higher Landau level bands, restoration of spin, and explicit breaking of spatial symmetries -- paying particular attention to the competition between CDWs and superconductivity. Our main findings are: (1) Generic local interactions can stabilize a nematic CDW in which integer quantum Hall layers spontaneously 'tilt', yielding unconventional Hall response. (2) We numerically establish that the non-Fermi liquid appears stable to perturbations that preserve effective dipole conservation symmetries that emerge within a Landau level band. (3) Upon explicitly breaking translation symmetry, attraction catalyzes a novel layered superconductor that hosts Weyl nodes, superconducts within each layer, and insulates transverse to the layers. These results expand the rich phenomenology of interacting bulk electrons in the high-field regime and potentially inform the design of field-resistant superconductivity in low-carrier-density materials."}

Then, we formulate an optimization problem, which allows us to coordinate battery charging and heating through maintaining queue stability. To solve the problem, we develop an online control algorithm within the theoretical framework of Lyapunov optimization. Note that our online method is prediction-free and independent of any assumed modeling of uncertainty. We also characterize both the feasibility and optimality of the proposed control approach. Numerical results based on real-world data corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our control method through comparisons."}

To connect robust behavior with non-trivial topological features present already in the dynamics of individual units, here we introduce the topological chiral random walker (TCRW) model. While exploring the system, a TCRW locates edges and boundaries in the system and develops topologically protected edge currents even in the presence of defects and disorder. Drawing on the bulk-boundary correspondence found in hard condensed matter systems allows us to rationalize the emergence of robust edge currents through topological features of the dynamic spectrum. We show that chiral motion and rotational noise with opposite chirality are two crucial components in our inherently non-Hermitian model. As proofs of principle, we first show that a topological walker outperforms diffusive motion to efficiently solve complex mazes due to its property of remaining on the edge with some rare detachments. Second, we use this model to design building blocks that can perform efficient self-assembly overcoming the timescale bottlenecks of diffusion-limited growth and reducing self-assembly times by approximately 80%."}

The demon can evolve the system farther from equilibrium, on average, if the particles obey Bose-Einstein statistics than if they are distinguishable. We experimentally support this decade-and-a-half-old prediction by comparing indistinguishable with distinguishable photons. We use a fully programmable linear-optics platform, whose local photon statistics were shown recently to behave thermally. Our demon nondestructively measures the number of photons in a subset of the modes. Guided by the outcome, he conditionally interchanges the measured and unmeasured modes. This interchange creates a positive temperature difference between a mode in a particular subset and a mode in the other. The temperature difference is greater, on average, if the photons are indistinguishable. This result bolsters a long-standing prediction about the interplay among thermodynamics, information, and quantum particle statistics.

We focus in particular on batch design, that is, the simultaneous optimization of multiple design variables, which leads to a notoriously difficult non-convex optimization problem. We tackle this challenge using a promising strategy recently proposed in the frequentist setting, which relaxes A-optimal design to the space of finite positive measures. Our main contribution is the rigorous identification of the Bayesian inference problem corresponding to this relaxed A-optimal OED formulation.

The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively.

With machine learned interatomic potentials being more and more ubiquitous, directly simulating complex catalytic systems with molecular dynamics (MD) is becoming increasingly feasible. Extending MSMs to dynamically coarse grain MD simulation data of catalytic processes, we analyze hydrogen dynamics on rhodium catalysts with slab and nanoparticle geometries over a range of hydrogen surface concentrations. Somewhat counterintuitively, nanoparticle features, such as corners and edges, effectively slow down the association/dissociation process, and the cooperative behavior of hydrogen-hydrogen interactions leads to a non-monotonic concentration dependence of the rates, which would not be predicted with standard TST."}

We introduce \\emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators."}

We show that the strong $d$-wave spin-momentum locking inherent to the altermagnetic band structure reconstructs the Fermi surface into spin-selective quasi-1D open sheets. This unique topology of Fermi surface drives an instability toward spin-resolved electronic charge density waves (CDWs), in which the ordering wave vectors for spin-up and spin-down electrons condense along two mutually orthogonal directions, forming spin-resolved stripe phases. As a consequence, this results in pronounced gap openings near the Fermi surface, and the superposition of these spin-resolved stripe orders leads to a checkerboard CDW in the charge channel and an antiphase spin-density-wave modulation in the spin channel. Upon increasing temperature, the density-wave order melts at $T_c$ due to thermal phase fluctuation while the gap opening persists, giving rise to a robust pseudogap regime, which eventually closes at a higher temperature $T_g$.

Using the full quantum master equation and input-output formalism for two-level systems coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide and driven by a coherent field, we show that an engineered DMI enables strong nonreciprocity in an otherwise reciprocal system, with tunable behavior governed by driving strength, detunings, and phase of the DMI. Using it not only demonstrates nonreciprocal transmission but also demonstrates nonreciprocal quantum entanglement and photon bunching. The system can end up in a pure state as certain decohering channels do not participate. The pure state leads to power-independent perfect transparency. Conditions are derived and depend on the propagation phase, the relative detuning of the two qubits, and the exchange interaction. At these pure-state points, the steady-state entanglement is reciprocal and admits a closed-form expression; away from them, phase control generates strong entanglement nonreciprocity. The DMI also reshapes photon statistics, redistributing two-photon correlations and shifting superbunching from transmission (no DMI) to reflection at finite DMI. These results establish DMI as a versatile resource for engineering nonreciprocity, transparency, entanglement, and photon correlations in waveguide QED, enabling isolators, routers, and superbunching light sources without requiring chiral waveguides."}

Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development."}

Each walk step is a unitary update that prepares coherent candidate moves, evaluates the objective and constraints reversibly -- including a constraint-satisfaction counter to enforce feasibility -- and encodes Metropolis acceptance amplitudes via a low-overhead linearized rule. At the logical level, the construction uses $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log_2 N)$ qubits to represent $n$ integer variables over the interval $[-N,\\,N-1]$, and the Toffoli-equivalent cost per Metropolis step grows linearly with the total logical qubit count. Using explicit ripple-carry adder constructions, we support linear objectives and mixed equality/inequality constraints. Numerical circuit-level simulations on a broad ensemble of randomly generated instances validate the predicted linear resource scaling and exhibit progressive thermalization toward low-cost feasible solutions under the annealing schedule.

We introduce \\emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites.

Extending this approach to general $C^1$ radial potentials is challenging due to the lack of explicit basis functions analogous to Bessel functions. To overcome this difficulty, we consider the equation $-Δu + V u = λu$ on a ball containing $Ω$, without imposing boundary conditions, for a collection of values $λ$ forming a fine discretisation of the interval in which eigenvalues are sought. By rewriting the problem in polar coordinates and applying a Fourier expansion with respect to the angular variable, we obtain a decoupled system of ordinary differential equations. These equations are solved numerically using a one-dimensional Finite Element Method, yielding a family of basis functions that are solutions of the equation $-Δu + V u = λu$ on the ball and are independent of the domain $Ω$.\n  Dirichlet eigenvalues of $-Δ+ V$ are then approximated by minimising the boundary values on $\\partial Ω$ among linear combinations of the basis functions and identifying those values of $λ$ for which the computed minimum is sufficiently small.

Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry."}

This paper proposes an extension of the newsvendor model into a mutli-period setting, aiming to develop a decision-making tool for manufacturing firms to determine the optimal production batch size. The objective function is to maximize operating profit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The model can also incorporate overhead costs, such as warehousing, shrinkage, cost of capital, and lead time between the production decision and output. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed model results in higher profitability compared to other newsvendor models used in our analysis, as well as the safety stock buffer approach. The key feature explaining its outperformance is better adaptability of the production batch size, that leads to fewer stock-outs relative to other newsvendor models and lower inventory levels compared to the safety stock buffer approach. The robustness analysis shows that the proposed model is quite tolerant of mismatches between the \"model\" and the \"true\" demand distributions. Finally, we provide some recommendations on selecting the appropriate \"model\" distribution for different SKUs."}

By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K."}

First, we propose a model called $δ$-CBO}, which incorporates nonvanishing diffusion to prevent premature collapse to suboptimal states. We also develop a numerically stable implementation, the Consensus Freezing scheme, that remains robust even for arbitrarily large time steps by freezing the consensus point over time intervals. We connect these models through appropriate asymptotic limits. Furthermore, we derive from the Consensus Freezing scheme by suitable time rescaling and asymptotics a further algorithm, the Consensus Hopping scheme, which can be interpreted as a form of $(1,λ)$-Evolution Strategy.

This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagomé lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra.

This yields a direct correspondence between the volumetric controllability score (VCS) and D-optimality, and between the average energy controllability score (AECS) and A-optimality, implying that the classical D/A invariance gap has a direct analogue in controllability scoring. By contrast, we point out that controllability scoring typically admits a unique optimizer, unlike approximate-OED formulations.

Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development."}

We introduce \\emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators."}

In particular, it is often unclear how collective enhancement, spontaneous emission, and vacuum fluctuations jointly give rise to both paired biphoton generation and unavoidable unpaired background within a single, self-consistent framework. Here we present a fully quantum microscopic theory within a unified Heisenberg--Langevin--Maxwell framework that explicitly incorporates dissipation and quantum noise, thereby revealing the microscopic origin of superradiant biphoton emission in atomic ensembles. The theory provides a consistent description of parametric gain and unpaired noise within the same open-quantum-system framework and applies to both Doppler-free cold atomic ensembles and Doppler-broadened warm vapors. In the high-optical-depth regime, the coupled propagation equations admit analytical solutions, under which the biphoton dynamics rigorously reduce to an effective collective two-level emission process. Within this limit, the biphoton correlation time and spectral properties are shown to obey closed-form scaling relations governed by optical depth and excited-state decoherence. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of superradiant biphoton generation and clarify the fundamental role of vacuum fluctuations and dissipation in setting the brightness, pairing efficiency, and temporal structure of atomic biphoton sources, with direct relevance to quantum networking and atomic quantum interfaces."}

We show that already on simple strongly convex functions such as $L(W)=\\frac12\\|W\\|_{\\text{F}}^2$, these perspectives are insufficient, suggesting that understanding Muon requires going beyond local proxies and pessimistic worst-case bounds. Instead, our analysis exposes two observations that already affect behavior on simple quadratics and are not well captured by prevailing abstractions: (i) approximation error in the polar step can qualitatively alter discrete-time dynamics and improve reachability and finite-time performance -- an effect practitioners exploit to tune Muon, but that existing theory largely treats as a pure accuracy compromise; and (ii) structural properties of the objective affect finite-budget constants beyond the prevailing conditioning-based explanations. Thus, any general theory covering these cases must either incorporate these ingredients explicitly or explain why they are irrelevant in the regimes of interest."}

Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate. For both constructions, the resulting gauged codes are shown to have properties analogous to 2D non-Abelian topological order -- e.g. the analog of a single anyon on a torus.

We do not assume any form of displacement convexity or displacement monotonicity.\n  In the gradient flow case, global exponential convergence is already known under our linear convexity assumption, with an asymptotic rate governed by the log-Sobolev constant of the stationary measure. Our contribution in this setting is to identify the sharp rate near equilibrium governed instead by the Poincaré constant. This rate coincides with the one suggested by Otto calculus (i.e. by a tight positivity estimate of the Wasserstein Hessian), and refines some results of Tamura (1984), extending them beyond quadratic objectives.\n  More importantly, our proof technique extends to certain non-gradient systems, such as linearly monotone two-player and multi-player games. In this case, we obtain explicit local exponential convergence rates in $χ^2$-divergence, thereby partially answering the open question raised by the authors at COLT 2024.

While effective in complex scenarios, they lack the verification guarantees found in classical guidance policies. Their black-box nature creates significant concerns regarding trustworthiness, limiting their adoption in safety-critical spaceflight applications. This work addresses this gap by developing a method to assess the safety of a trained neural network feedback controller via automatic domain splitting and polynomial bounding. The methodology involves embedding the trained neural network into the system's dynamical equations, rendering the closed-loop system autonomous. The system flow is then approximated by high-order Taylor polynomials, which are subsequently manipulated to construct polynomial maps that project state uncertainties onto an event manifold. Automatic domain splitting ensures the polynomials are accurate over their relevant subdomains, whilst also allowing an extensive state-space to be analysed efficiently. Utilising polynomial bounding techniques, the resulting event values may be rigorously constrained and analysed within individual subdomains, thereby establishing bounds on the range of possible closed-loop outcomes from using such neural network controllers and supporting safety assessment and informed operational decision-making in real-world missions."}

Recent work has shown that surprisingly simple measurement protocols--comprising only single-qubit measurements--suffice to certify arbitrary $n$-qubit states [Huang, Preskill, Soleimanifar '25; Gupta, He, O'Donnell '25]. However, these certification protocols are not robust: rather than allowing constant $ε_1$, they can only positively certify states within $ε_1=O(1/n)$ trace distance of the target. In many experimental settings, the appropriate error tolerance is constant as the system size grows, so this lack of robustness renders existing tests inapplicable at scale, no matter how many times the test is repeated.\n  Here we present robust certification protocols based on few-qubit measurements that apply to all but a $O(2^{-n})$-fraction of pure target states. Our first protocol achieves constant robustness, i.e. $ε_1=Θ(1)$, using a single $O(\\log n)$-qubit measurement along with single-qubit measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the other qubits. As a corollary of its robustness, this protocol also achieves constant (in $n$) copy complexity, which is optimal. Our second protocol uses exclusively single-qubit measurements and is nearly robust: $ε_1=Ω(1/\\log n)$. Our tests are based on a new uncertainty principle for conditional fidelities, which may be of independent interest."}

It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms."}

The aim is to determine which schemes can effectively recover specific properties of input quantum states, including both linear and nonlinear features, while also quantifying the resource requirements in terms of measurements and reservoir dimensionality.

We focus in particular on batch design, that is, the simultaneous optimization of multiple design variables, which leads to a notoriously difficult non-convex optimization problem.

Our main contribution is the rigorous identification of the Bayesian inference problem corresponding to this relaxed A-optimal OED formulation. Moreover, building on recent work, we develop a Wasserstein gradient-flow -based optimization algorithm for the expected utility and introduce novel regularization schemes that guarantee convergence to an empirical measure. These theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments demonstrating both convergence and the effectiveness of the proposed regularization strategy."}

However, standard quantum teleportation is fundamentally limited by the quadratic growth of measurement complexity and high classical communication overhead, requiring the resolution of $d^2$ Bell states and $2\\log_2 d$ classical bits. In this study, we propose a resource-efficient high-dimensional coherence teleportation (REHDCT) protocol. By designing $d$ sets of specialized positive operator-valued measure (POVM) bases, our protocol achieves a 50\\% reduction in classical communication by utilizing one of the $d$ designed POVM sets, which effectively scales the measurement complexity from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing initial phase engineering to align the target qudit with the measurement basis, theoretically perfect teleportation of quantum coherence can be achieved for arbitrary qudit states. A quantitative robustness analysis reveals that the protocol remains highly resilient to operational errors, maintaining an efficiency above 99.6\\% even under a 0.1 rad phase deviation for $d=16$. Our analysis under various noise models (amplitude damping, phase flip, depolarizing, and dit-flip) confirms that high-dimensional systems exhibit an expanding quantum advantage window as dimensionality increases.

However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum subspace diagonalization that has the potential to better control sensitivity to noise. Our approach leverages eigenvector-preserving transformations (rotations) of the generalized eigenvalue problem prior to thresholding. We study this effect in practical settings by applying this rotation thresholding scheme to an iterative quantum Krylov algorithm for several chemical systems, including the industry-relevant Fe(III)-NTA chelate complex. We develop a particular heuristic to select the rotation angle from noisy data and find for certain systems and noise regimes that the samples required to reach a target error for ground state estimation can be reduced by a factor of up to 100. Furthermore, with oracle access to the optimal transformation, more dramatic improvements are possible and we observe reductions in sample requirements by up to $10^4$, motivating the continued development of methods that can realize these improvements in practice.

This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits provide warm-start initializations for variational optimization, enabling high-fidelity state preparation for large systems. Target MPSs are either specified as physical quantum states or constructed from classical datasets via amplitude encoding, using step-by-step singular value decompositions or tensor cross interpolation.

We evaluate the full pipeline on datasets of varying complexity across systems of 19-50 qubits and identify trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth.

In particular, we show that commutativity of the parameter-encoding generators alone does not ensure the saturability of the QCR bound once realistic noise produces mixed probe states. Our results provide a systematic classification of saturability conditions in multiparameter quantum metrology and clarify fundamental precision limits in noisy distributed quantum sensing beyond idealized pure-state settings."}

Neutral-atom arrays have both been coupled to Rydberg states to enable high-fidelity quantum gates in universal processing architectures, and to optical cavities to realize interfaces to photons. However, combining these two capabilities and coupling atom arrays to highly excited Rydberg states in the mode of an optical cavity has been an outstanding challenge. Here we present a novel cavity-coupled Rydberg array that achieves this long-standing goal. We prepare, detect, and control individual atoms in a scalable optical tweezer array, couple them strongly to the optical mode of a high-finesse optical cavity and excite them in a controlled way to Rydberg states. We show that strong coupling to an optical cavity - demonstrated via the dispersive shift of the resonance of the cavity in presence of the atoms - and strong Rydberg interactions - demonstrated via the collective enhancement of Rydberg coupling in the atomic array - can be achieved in our setup at the same spatial location. Our presented experimental platform opens the path to several new directions, including the realization of quantum network nodes, quantum simulation of long-range interacting, open quantum systems and photonic-state engineering leveraging high-fidelity Rydberg control."}

State transfer then reduces to a geodesic rotation on a synthetic Bloch sphere, governed by resonance and phase-matching conditions we derive in closed form. For single Fock states, RSE achieves $O(n^{1/4})$ scaling in both evolution time and gate depth, showing a fundamental improvement over existing deterministic schemes. The construction generalizes to $K$-component superpositions via a $(K{+}1)$-dimensional invariant subspace with full $\\mathrm{SU}(K{+}1)$ controllability, requiring only 3-5 iterations of operations for superpositions spanning photon numbers 70--100.

In what we connote as spatial quantum sensing the goal is, given an underlying field and a set of quantum sensors interrogating the field in a set of positions, to find an estimator for some property the field. This property can have multiple forms, be it distinguishing the source of a target signal, or evaluating the field (or a derivative thereof) in an arbitrary position. In this work we also link this problem to networks of quantum sensors, and the role and usefulness of entangling these sensors. We find that the estimators that come out as a solution to the problem are such that a non-local entangled strategy provides maximum precision. We start by working under the assumption of polynomial fields, which relates to the interpolation problem, and then generalize for any signal that is modeled via analytical functions, giving rise to any general least-squares estimator. We discuss the effects of the placement of the sensors in the estimation, namely, how to find well defined, construction error-free placements for the sensors. In the case of interpolation we provide concrete examples and proofs in a $m$-dimensional array of sensors, and discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for the more general cases. We provide clear examples of the possible use-cases and statements, and compare a non-local entangled strategy with the best local strategy for an interpolation problem, showing the benefit in terms of precision in a distributed sensing scenario. This is a key tool for a wide-range of problem in sensing problems, ranging from large-scale such as earth-sized experiments, to local-scale, such has biological experiments."}

On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a \"leaf typicality\" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble."}

Such sensors can be spatially separated (gradiometry or gravitational-wave detection) or consist of different internal states (magnetometry or quantum clock interferometry), in which case a signal-amplitude modulation may serve as a signature of a differential phase. In this work, we introduce Phase Estimation from Amplitude Collapse (PEAC) by applying targeted fitting methods for different magnetically sensitive substates of an atom interferometer. We demonstrate that PEAC provides higher trueness (up to 80% bias reduction) than standard tools for perfectly correlated signals. At its working point near, but not exactly at phase settings resulting in vanishing amplitude, it achieves precision competitive with standard methods, contrasting prior claims of optimal operation at vanishing amplitude. PEAC presents a generally applicable complementary evaluation method for correlated interferometers without phase stability, increasing the overall accuracy and enabling applications beyond atom interferometry."}

In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincaré duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian Clifford stabilizer code, whose stabilizers are reminiscent of the action of a Type-III twisted quantum double. Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate. For both constructions, the resulting gauged codes are shown to have properties analogous to 2D non-Abelian topological order -- e.g. the analog of a single anyon on a torus. We conclude by demonstrating that our gauging procedures enable magic state preparation via the measurement of logical Clifford gates. Consequently, our gauging constructions offer a protocol for performing non-Clifford operations on any qLDPC code."}

In this work, we go beyond the standard aforementioned scenarios by consider not only the classical measurement outcome of a measurement, but also its the post-measurement quantum state. More specifically, instead of considering only the positive-operator valued measure (POVM) operators, we consider their associated Lüders' instrument associated with them. We prove that, when the post-measurement quantum states are available, the task of discriminating two qubit projective measurements is equivalent to discriminating two copies of quantum states associated to each projector pair, extending previous results known for the case where probe states are separable. Then, we proceed by showing that the advantage of considering post-measurement states in measurement discrimination can be large. We formalise this claim by presenting a family of pairs of measurements where the ratio between the discrimination bias of the measurement discrimination task with and without post-measurement states can be arbitrarily large. This shows that, while the post-measurement state was neglected in most of the previous literature, its use can significantly improve the performance of quantum measurement discrimination."}

For this we use a specific state preparation and measurement of the superposed source mass, including a postselection, which altogether results in a repulsive gravitational force on the probe particle. A classical gravitational field can never lead to repulsion, as the effect requires quantum interference of two distinct states of gravity. We also present a calculation in the Heisenberg picture under the formalism of weak values that illustrates how repulsion is achieved. Finally, we estimate the range of parameters (masses and the spatio-temporal extent of interference) for which the experiment is feasible."}

A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum advantage demonstrations and for so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). This setting derives its computational power from the indistinguishability of the photons, i.e., their relative overlap. Therefore, standard fidelity witnesses developed for distinguishable particles (including qubits) do not apply directly, because they merely certify the closeness to some fixed target state. We introduce a measure of fidelity suitable for this setting and show several different ways to witness it, based on earlier proposals for measuring genuine multi-photon indistinguishability. We argue that a witness based upon the discrete Fourier transform is an optimal choice. We experimentally implement this witness and certify the fidelity of several multi-photon states."}

Here, we tackle realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction in momentum space, including models with strong high-momentum correlations, and demonstrate highly accurate results for the deuteron. We further provide additional benchmarks in coordinate space. We introduce an expression for the variational energy that enters the loss function, which can be evaluated efficiently within the PINNs framework. Results are in excellent agreement with proven numerical methods, with a relative error between the value of the predicted binding energy by the PINN and the numerical benchmark of the order of $10^{-6}$.

By introducing a restricted statistical query model, we prove that nontrivial phases with long-range CMI, such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, are hard to learn. We validate our claims by using recurrent, convolutional, and Transformer neural networks to learn the syndrome and physical distributions of toric/surface code under bit flip noise. Our findings suggest hardness of learning as a diagnostic tool for detecting mixed-state phases and transitions and error-correction thresholds, and they suggest CMI and more generally ``non-local Gibbsness'' as metrics for how hard a distribution is to learn."}

Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry."}

For an even number of particles, the spectra conform to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, as expected for a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian. In stark contrast, the odd-parity sector exhibits exact double degeneracy of all eigenstates even after resolving all known symmetries, and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble accurately describes the spacing distribution between these doublets. The simultaneous emergence of two different random-matrix ensembles within a single physical system constitutes an unprecedented finding, opening new avenues for both random matrix theory and flat-band physics."}

Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions.

This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged Rényi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture."}
