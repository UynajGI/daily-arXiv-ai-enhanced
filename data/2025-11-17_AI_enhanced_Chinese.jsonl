While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \\emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters. Finally, the derived results are illustrated in a case study of privacy protection for distributed sensing in smart buildings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u4fdd\u62a4\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u70b9\u6001\u6700\u5927\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff08PML\uff09\u9690\u79c1\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86PML\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u9690\u79c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u9762\u5bf9\u62e5\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u6001\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u654f\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u70b9\u6001\u6700\u5927\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff08PML\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faPML\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecePML\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86PML\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86PML\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u53ca\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5173\u4e8ePML\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5177\u5907\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7535\u4ef7\u4e0e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u9519\u914d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u884c\u7535\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u9f13\u52b1\u9ad8\u78b3\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u7684\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7528\u7535\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\u5bf9\u7528\u7535\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8303\u56f42\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u7535\u529b\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff08MEF\u3001AEF\uff09\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u9879\u76ee\uff08\u5982IBDR\u3001DAM\uff09\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9519\u914d\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u7535\u4ef7\u5e76\u672a\u53cd\u6620\u4f4e\u78b3\u7528\u7535\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u78b3\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u884c\u7535\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u4ef7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u9009\u5740\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Computational models of DBS are widely used to investigate the effects of stimulation on neural tissue, to explore stimulation targets and sweetspots, and ultimately, to aid clinicians in the DBS programming by calculating the stimulation parameters. Commonly, DBS is performed bilaterally, i.e. with one lead in each brain hemisphere, where computational models are solved independently for one lead at a time. This paper treats scenarios where multiple DBS leads are implanted in close proximity to one another, resulting in interacting electrical fields and, therefore, potentially overlapping stimulation spreads. In particular, a global dual-lead model is compared to approximations derived from single-lead approaches in a cohort of twelve multiple sclerosis (MS) tremor patients. It is concluded that simple superposition of volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) underestimates activation, while superposition of electric fields or activating functions leads to overestimation. It is concluded that given close proximity of DBS leads, the VTA cannot be computed individually as stimulation fields exhibit significant and complex interaction.

We use the moment estimation base on the scores of subjects to infer the merit parameters. We establish a unified theoretical framework in which the uniform consistency and asymptotic normality of the moment estimator hold as the number of subjects goes to infinity. A key idea for the proof of the consistency is that we obtain the convergence rate of the Newton iterative sequence for solving the estimator.

Compared to our previous study, this motion model yields smoother and more physically plausible estimates of brain activity even when the measurement noise is high, for both superficial and deep sources.

Variance is typically estimated using sandwich or bootstrap methods, which can either treat the PS as estimated or fixed. The latter is thought to be conservative. Comparisons between the sandwich and bootstrap estimators have been compared in moderate to large sample sizes, favoring the bootstrap estimator. With the growing interest in treatments for rare disease and externally controlled clinical trials, very small sample sizes are not uncommon and the asymptotic properties of sandwich estimators may not hold. Bootstrap methods that allow for PS re-estimation can also generate problems with quasi-separation in small samples. It is unclear whether it is safe to prefer sandwich estimators or to assume that treating the PS as fixed is conservative. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to compare the performance of bootstrap versus sandwich variance and CI estimators for average treatment effects estimated with PS methods. We systematically evaluated the impact of treating the PS as fixed versus re-estimating it. These methodological comparisons were performed using Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and Augmented Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (AIPW) estimators. Simulations assessed performance under various conditions, including small sample sizes and different outcome and treatment prevalences. We illustrate the differences in our motivating example, the LIMIT-JIA trial. We show that the sandwich estimators can perform quite poorly in small samples, and fixed PS methods are not necessarily conservative. A stratified bootstrap avoids quasi-separation and performs well.

Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408POD\u548cKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebfRLS\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u82f1\u8bed\u8f6e\u6210\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d8\u5f62\u57fa\u91d1\u5c5e\u6210\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u82f1\u8bed\u8f6e\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u878d\u5408POD\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u964d\u7ef4\uff0cKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5c06\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u7ebfRLS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u82f1\u8bed\u8f6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u964d\u9636\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

An extensively studied instance is the \\emph{covariate shift}, where the marginal distribution of covariates differs across domains, while the conditional distribution of outcome remains the same. The doubly-robust (DR) estimator, recently introduced by \\cite{kato2023double}, combines the density ratio estimation with a pilot regression model and demonstrates asymptotic normality and $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, even when the pilot estimates converge slowly. However, the prior arts has focused exclusively on deriving asymptotic results and has left open the question of non-asymptotic guarantees for the DR estimator.\n  This paper establishes the first non-asymptotic learning bounds for the DR covariate shift adaptation. Our main contributions are two-fold: (\\romannumeral 1) We establish \\emph{structure-agnostic} high-probability upper bounds on the excess target risk of the DR estimator that depend only on the $L^2$-errors of the pilot estimates and the Rademacher complexity of the model class, without assuming specific procedures to obtain the pilot estimate, and (\\romannumeral 2) under \\emph{well-specified parameterized models}, we analyze the DR covariate shift adaptation based on modern techniques for non-asymptotic analysis of MLE, whose key terms governed by the Fisher information mismatch term between the source and target distributions. Together, these findings bridge asymptotic efficiency properties and a finite-sample out-of-distribution generalization bounds, providing a comprehensive theoretical underpinnings for the DR covariate shift adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\uff08DR\uff09\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5b66\u4e60\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e pilot \u4f30\u8ba1\u7684L\u00b2\u8bef\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4e3aDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8eDR\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0epilot\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528Rademacher\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3MLE\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5047\u8bbepilot\u4f30\u8ba1\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u98ce\u9669\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u914d\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8epilot\u4f30\u8ba1L\u00b2\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7bRademacher\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u578b\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5728\u826f\u597d\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e90\u57df\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u914d\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u4e3aDR\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Recently, there has been growing interest in the full ETH, which extends the framework of the conventional ETH and postulates a smooth function to describe the multi-point correlations among matrix elements. Within this framework, free cumulants play a central role, and most previous studies have primarily focused on closed systems. In this paper, we extend the analysis to a system-bath setup, considering both an idealized case with a random-matrix bath and a more realistic scenario where the bath is modeled as a defect Ising chain.

One promising remedy is to utilize the time-dependent 2-reduced density matrix (2-RDM) that directly represents two-body observables in an N-particle system, and resort to the extended TDDFT for multibody densities to break the confines of spatial local on one-body density [Phys. Rev. Lett. 26(6) (2024) 263001]. However, the usage of 2-RDM is prohibitive due to the augmented dimensionality, e.g., 4-D space for unidimensional 2-RDM. This work addresses the high-dimensional numerical challenges by using an equivalent Wigner phase-space formulation of 2-RDM and seeking efficient spectral approximations to nonlocal quantum potentials. For spatial periodic case, a pseudo-difference operator approach is derived for both the Hartree-exchange-correlation term and two-body collision operator, while the discretization via the Chebyshev spectral element method is provided for non-periodic case. A massively parallel numerical scheme, which integrates these spectral approximations with a distributed characteristics method, allows us to make the first attempt for real simulations of 2-RDM dynamics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the two-body correction to the quantum kinetic theory, and show the increase in the system's entropy induced by the two-bdoy interaction. Thus it may pave the way for an accurate description of 2-RDM dynamics and advance to a practical application of many-body TDDFT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWigner\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8ff0\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d562-\u7ea6\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff082-RDM\uff09\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u53cc\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u4f53\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\uff08TDDFT\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53cc\u4f53\u6f14\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u53cc\u6fc0\u53d1\u6982\u7387\u548c\u53cc\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u8054\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u53cc\u4f53\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75282-RDM\u7684Wigner\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u52bf\u7684\u8c31\u903c\u8fd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u51fa\u4f2a\u5dee\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u6cd5\u5904\u7406Hartree-exchange-correlation\u9879\u548c\u53cc\u4f53\u78b0\u649e\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u975e\u5468\u671f\u60c5\u51b5\u5219\u4f7f\u7528Chebyshev\u8c31\u5143\u6cd5\u79bb\u6563\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u7ebf\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u884c\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862-RDM\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53cc\u4f53\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u53cc\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u71b5\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4e862-RDM\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u4f53TDDFT\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Despite Kamchatka's high seismic activity, the long-term evolution of seismicity preceding major ruptures has been poorly documented. Identifying temporal patterns-such as multiyear quiescence and short-term activation-is essential for understanding megathrust failure processes. We applied the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model and change-point analysis to earthquakes with M>=5 within a 100-km radius of the 2025 mainshock epicenter, using the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) catalog spanning 1975-2025. This approach quantified temporal variations in the seismicity rate and detected statistically significant change points. We identified a pronounced approximately 20-year quiescent interval beginning around mid-2003, followed by an abrupt activation that commenced with the M7.4 foreshock on 20 July 2025. A similar quiescence-to-activation sequence near the eventual hypocenter was also observed for the 1997 M7.8 Kronotsky and 2006 M8.3 Simushirskoe earthquakes, which ruptured segments immediately north and south of the 2025 rupture, respectively. These results suggest that heightened seismic activity following multiyear quiescence is a recurrent feature of the Kamchatka-Kuril subduction system hosting large megathrust earthquakes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7ETAS\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53d8\u70b9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b02025\u5e74\u582a\u5bdf\u52a0M8.8\u5730\u9707\u524d\u5b58\u5728\u7ea620\u5e74\u7684\u5730\u9707\u5e73\u9759\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e3b\u9707\u524d\u77ed\u6682\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u90bb\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5927\u5730\u9707\u524d\u4e5f\u66fe\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u582a\u5bdf\u52a0-\u5343\u5c9b\u4fef\u51b2\u5e26\u5927\u5730\u9707\u7684\u666e\u904d\u524d\u5146\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u5de8\u5927\u4fef\u51b2\u5e26\u5730\u9707\u53d1\u751f\u524d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5730\u9707\u6d3b\u52a8\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5982\u591a\u5e74\u5e73\u9759\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u5de8\u9707\u7834\u88c2\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528ETAS\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53d8\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf91975-2025\u5e74\u95f4\u4e3b\u9707\u9707\u4e2d100\u516c\u91cc\u8303\u56f4\u5185M\u22655\u7684\u5730\u9707\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528ANSS\u5730\u9707\u76ee\u5f55\u91cf\u5316\u5730\u9707\u6d3b\u52a8\u7387\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4ece2003\u5e74\u4e2d\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u7ea620\u5e74\u5e73\u9759\u671f\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u57282025\u5e747\u670820\u65e5M7.4\u524d\u9707\u540e\u7a81\u7136\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e5f\u51fa\u73b0\u57281997\u5e74\u548c2006\u5e74\u90bb\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u5927\u5730\u9707\u524d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5e74\u5e73\u9759\u540e\u7a81\u7136\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5730\u9707\u5e8f\u5217\u662f\u582a\u5bdf\u52a0-\u5343\u5c9b\u4fef\u51b2\u5e26\u5927\u578b\u9006\u51b2\u5730\u9707\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u524d\u5146\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u533a\u57df\u6784\u9020\u52a0\u8f7d\u548c\u5e94\u529b\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u8054\u5408\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u96c6\u7fa4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u9ad8\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fb9\u754c\uff08\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6bef\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7fa4\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1b\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e2a\u4f53\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u6355\u98df\u8005\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9690\u6027\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e2a\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u8054\u5408\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u8026\u5408\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u96c6\u7fa4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "1) \u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f62\u6210\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6bef\uff0c\u754c\u5b9a\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1b2) \u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u6355\u98df\u8005\u6270\u52a8\u53cd\u5e94\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u534f\u8c03\uff1b3) \u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u65e0\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9690\u6027\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8026\u5408\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8054\u5408\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Our approach is based on solving two coupled Catoni-type equations, one for estimating the trend parameters and the other for estimating the error variance. Notably, this joint estimation strategy cannot be obtained by minimizing a single loss function involving both the trend and variance parameters. The method offers four key advantages: (i) the length of the resulting (1 - epsilon) confidence interval scales as (log(1/epsilon))^{1/2}, matching the order achieved by classical estimators for sub-Gaussian data; (ii) it is tuning-free, eliminating the need for separate variance estimation; (iii) it allows flexible selection of Catoni-type functions tailored to the data; and (iv) it delivers strong performance for high-variance data, thanks to the explicit inclusion of the variance term in the denominators of both equations.\n  We establish the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the proposed joint robust estimators using new analytical techniques. The coupled equations are inherently complex, which makes the theoretical analysis of their solutions challenging. To address this, we employ the Poincare-Miranda theorem to show that the solutions lie within geometric regions, such as cylinders or cones, centered around the true parameter values.

Despite its smooth dependence on the refractive index at the PDE level, the corresponding spectral map from material parameters to eigenpairs may exhibit non-smooth or bifurcating behavior. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework identifying sufficient conditions for such non-smooth spectral behavior in the ITP on general domains. We further specialize our analysis to some radially symmetric geometries, enabling a more precise characterization of bifurcations in the spectrum. Computationally, we formulate the ITP as a parametric, discrete, nonlinear eigenproblem and use a match-based adaptive contour eigensolver to accurately and efficiently track eigenvalue trajectories under parameter variation.

However, while they are frequently used in high-dimensional regressions, they lack power in low-dimensional and sparse signal settings. One of the main reasons is that knockoffs require a minimum number of selections, depending on the nominal FDR level. In this paper, we leverage e-values to allow the nominal level to be switched after looking at the data and applying the knockoff procedure. In this way, we can increase the nominal level in cases where the original knockoff procedure does not make any selections to potentially make discoveries.

Our method builds on the concept of forgetting factors, allowing the estimator to adapt to gradual or abrupt changes in the data-generating process without prior knowledge of its dynamics. We introduce a novel online forgetting-factor periodogram and show that, under stationarity, it asymptotically recovers the properties of its offline counterpart. Leveraging this, we construct an online Whittle estimator, and further develop an adaptive online spectral estimator that dynamically tunes its forgetting factor using the Whittle likelihood as a loss. Through extensive simulation studies and an application to ocean drifter velocity data, we demonstrate the method's ability to track time-varying spectral properties in real-time with strong empirical performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6d41\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u6c42\uff1a\u56fa\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u56e0\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9057\u5fd8\u56e0\u5b50\u5468\u671f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebfWhittle\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u9057\u5fd8\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8c31\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u7a33\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u6e10\u8fd1\u6062\u590d\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65f6\u53d8\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Here, we review the current advances on this topic, focusing mainly on key degradation mechanisms and methodologies such as physics-aware, data-driven, and hybrid modeling approaches. Key open challenges are analyzed, including the need for more accurate degradation modeling, effective management of multi-stack systems, and advancements in the currently underdeveloped action phase, in which diagnostic and prognostic insights are translated into real-time system responses, such as dynamic load derating, thermal-management adjustments, or automated maintenance triggers, to prevent failures and extend PEFC life. While notable strides have been made in recent years in diagnostics and remaining useful life estimation, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate these insights into actionable strategies. Future directions highlight the need to address data scarcity and advance interdisciplinary research. Key focus areas include sensor integration, artificial intelligence, and digital twins. Additionally material innovations play a crucial role in bridging existing gaps.

By re-formulating the global cost in a bilinear form, we derive local subgraph problems whose gradients approximately align with the global descent direction via an SVD-based test on the $ZC$ matrix. This leads to an iterate-and-embed scheme over disjoint 1-hop neighborhoods that preserves feasibility by construction (positivity and budget) and scales to large geometric graphs. For objectives that depend on pairwise eigenvalue differences $h(\u03bb_i-\u03bb_j)$, we obtain a quadratic upper bound in the degree vector, which motivates a ``warm-start'' by degree-regularization. The warm start uses randomized gossip to estimate global average degree, accelerating subsequent local descent while maintaining decentralization, and realizing $\\sim95\\%{}$ of the performance with respect to centralized optimization. We further introduce a learning-based proposer that predicts one-shot edge updates on maximal 1-hop embeddings, yielding immediate objective reductions.

We consider a Bayesian framework with rescaled and Gaussian sieve priors, using a collection of noisy, discrete observations taken from a suitable exterior domain. Our main result shows that the posterior distribution concentrates around the true parameter as the number of measurements increases. Furthermore, we establish tight convergence rates for the reconstruction error of the posterior mean. A central technical challenge is to obtain refined stability estimates for both the forward and inverse problems.

Building upon the recent EPLS methodology for modeling extremal dependence between a response variable and high-dimensional covariates, we extend the approach to more realistic data settings where both serial correlation and missing-ness occur. Specifically, we consider a single-index inverse regression model under heavy-tailed conditions and introduce a Missing-at-Random (MAR) mechanism acting on the covariates, whose probability depends on the extremeness of the response. The asymptotic behavior of the proposed estimator is established within an alpha-mixing framework, leading to consistency results under regularly varying tails. Extensive Monte-Carlo experiments covering eleven dependence schemes (including ARMA, GARCH, and nonlinear ESTAR processes) demonstrate that the method performs robustly across a wide range of heavy-tailed and dependent scenarios, even when substantial portions of data are missing.

In this paper, inspired by our previous work [1] and based on the notion of discretization maps, we construct numerical schemes that preserve flatness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6784\u9020\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u524d\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u5dee\u5206\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e2d\u4e0d\u88ab\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In the high-dimensional regime $d \\to \\infty$, we prove under suitable assumptions that a phase transition occurs in the polynomial regime $n = d^\u03ba$, with $n$ the sample size. Namely, we prove that $\\lVert \\hat \u03a3- E \\hat \u03a3\\rVert \\Rightarrow 0$ if and only if $\u03ba> \u03ba_*$ for some threshold $\u03ba_*$ determined by the behavior of the maximum likelihood ratios. Moreover, we identify general situations where $\u03ba_* = 1/\u03bb_1$, with $\u03bb_1$ the smallest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the auxiliary distribution used to estimate $\\hat \u03a3$ by importance sampling. This suggests that importance sampling will work better with covariance matrices having a large smallest eigenvalue. We carry this insight into recent CE schemes proposed to estimate the probability of high-dimensional rare events. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that better CE schemes are also the ones with larger smallest eigenvalue, even though these algorithms were not designed to smooth the spectrum. This new spectral interpretation raises stimulating questions and opens research directions for the design of efficient high-dimensional algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u679c\u8d8a\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u7279\u6027\u7684\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b $\\hat \u03a3= {\\bf X} L {\\bf X}^\\top$ \u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6837\u672c\u91cf $n = d^\u03ba$ \u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53 $\u03ba > \u03ba_* $ \u65f6\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u8d8b\u4e8e\u96f6\uff0c\u4e14 $\u03ba_* = 1/\u03bb_1$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d $\u03bb_1$ \u662f\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u5e03\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Based on this, we build a basis for this manifold using an efficient extended-Krylov-subspace iteration that involves a single matrix factorization.

The interventions arise from a cost-penalized information projection of the independent product of the organic propensity and a user-specified target, yielding closed-form Boltzmann-Gibbs couplings. The induced marginals define modified stochastic policies that interpolate smoothly, via a single tilt parameter, from the organic law or from the target distribution toward a product-of-experts limit when all destination costs are strictly positive. One of these families recovers and extends incremental propensity score interventions, retaining identification without global positivity. For inference, we derive efficient influence functions under a nonparametric model for the expected outcomes after these policies and construct one-step estimators with uniform confidence bands. In simulations, the proposed estimators improve stability and robustness to nuisance misspecification relative to plug-in baselines. The framework can operationalize graded scientific hypotheses under realistic constraints: because inputs are modular, analysts can sweep feasible policy spaces, prototype candidates, and align interventions with budgets and logistics before committing experimental resources. This could help close the loop between observational evidence and resource-aware experimental design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u5904\u7406\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6295\u5f71\u7684Boltzmann-Gibbs\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5e72\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6b63\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u73b0\u5b9e\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u79bb\u6563\u5904\u7406\u4e0b\u7684Boltzmann-Gibbs\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u503e\u659c\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u503e\u5411\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u952e\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d2\u4ef6\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e72\u6270\u8bef\u8bbe\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u5168\u5c40\u6b63\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u3002"}}

Burns", "Jiaming Liang"], "title": "Linear-Space Extragradient Methods for Fast, Large-Scale Optimal Transport", "comment": "45 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Optimal transport (OT) and its entropy-regularized form (EOT) have become increasingly prominent computational problems, with applications in machine learning and statistics. Recent years have seen a commensurate surge in first-order methods aiming to improve the complexity of large-scale (E)OT. However, there has been a consistent tradeoff: attaining state-of-the-art rates requires $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ storage to enable ergodic primal averaging. In this work, we demonstrate that recently proposed primal-dual extragradient methods (PDXG) can be implemented entirely in the dual with $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ storage. Additionally, we prove that regularizing the reformulated OT problem is equivalent to EOT with extensions to entropy-regularized barycenter problems, further widening the applications of the proposed method. The proposed dual-only extragradient method (DXG) is the first algorithm to achieve $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity for $\\varepsilon$-approximate OT with $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the dual extragradient method scales favorably in non/weakly-regularized regimes compared to existing algorithms, though future work is needed to improve performance in certain problem classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u5728\u5bf9\u5076\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5916\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DXG\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u5728O(n)\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728O(n)\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230O(n\u00b2\u03b5\u207b\u00b9)\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e/\u5f31\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08EOT\uff09\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9700\u8981O(n\u00b2)\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u6536\u655b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u539f\u5bf9\u5076\u5916\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\uff08PDXG\uff09\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u5bf9\u5076\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u5076\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5916\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DXG\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u7684OT\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8eEOT\u53ca\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u91cd\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3002", "result": "DXG\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728O(n)\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u5bf9\u03b5-\u8fd1\u4f3cOT\u8fbe\u5230O(n\u00b2\u03b5\u207b\u00b9)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u975e/\u5f31\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

More recently, there has been an increased interest in model set selection (MSS), where the aim is to identify a (confidence) set of near-optimal models. Here, we generalize the MSS framework further by introducing the idea of model class selection (MCS). In MCS, multiple model collections are evaluated, and all collections that contain at least one optimal model are sought for identification. Under mild conditions, data splitting based approaches are shown to provide general solutions for MCS. As a direct consequence, for particular datasets we are able to investigate formally whether classes of simpler and more interpretable statistical models are able to perform on par with more complex black-box machine learning models.

However, monitoring is still often performed manually due to the lack of suitable algorithmic methods and data. This paper introduces a high-fidelity, physics-enhanced simulator of a three-pump wastewater station that captures transient hydro-mechanical dynamics at a one-second resolution. The simulator is fully parameter-driven, adaptable to other wastewater stations, and capable of generating datasets for data-driven analytics. It can also generate balanced faulty datasets when real failures are scarce or confidential. A comparison with high-frequency SCADA data from a municipal station shows strong agreement across key operational metrics. Furthermore, the paper proposes robust statistical and mathematical frameworks for fault detection and isolation, including a nested-model F-test to detect pump degradation or system faults, and a tangent residual approach to distinguish pump faults from system faults using operating-point kinematics. This framework enables what-if studies, facilitates early fault diagnosis based on flow rate and head, and provides actionable insights for condition-based maintenance in wastewater pumping infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u7269\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e09\u6cf5\u6c61\u6c34\u6cf5\u7ad9\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9694\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u6cf5\u7ad9\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u4ecd\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u7ef4\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff081\u79d2\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u590d\u73b0\u77ac\u6001\u6c34\u529b\u673a\u68b0\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5d4c\u5957\u6a21\u578bF\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u5207\u7ebf\u6b8b\u5dee\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9694\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0e\u5e02\u653f\u6cf5\u7ad9\u9ad8\u9891SCADA\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u793a\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u884c\u6307\u6807\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6cf5\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u5e76\u533a\u5206\u6cf5\u6545\u969c\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u6f14\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u51b5\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6c61\u6c34\u6cf5\u7ad9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Petrella"], "title": "The Maximal Variance of Unilaterally Truncated Gaussian and Chi Distributions", "comment": "51 pages, 17 figures", "summary": "This work explores the bounds of the variance of unilaterally truncated Gaussian distributions (UTGDs) and scaled chi distributions (UTSCDs) with fixed means. For any arbitrary Gaussian distribution function, $f(x;\u03bc,\u03c3)$, with a fixed, finite mean $M$ on the truncated domain $x \\ge a$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, it is proven that the variance is bounded: specifically, $\\sup \\mathrm{Var}(x)_{|x \\ge a}= \\sup \\mathrm{Var}(x)_{|x \\le a} =(M-a)^2$. For a fixed cutoff, $a$, the variance can be considered a function of only $M$, $a$, and the location parameter $\u03bc$. Examples of such approximating functions, which can be used for model calibration, are developed in addition to other, related calibration methods. For UTSCDs, numerical evidence is presented indicating that for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z+}$ degrees of freedom, or dimensions, and a fixed, finite mean, the variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(R)$, over $R \\in [a,\\infty)$ reaches its maximum value $M^2(\u03c0-2)/2$ at $a=0$, $n=1$. For a fixed cutoff value, there is a local maximum in the variance as a function of $n$, and the number of dimensions resulting in the maximal variance, $n_{\\mathrm{vmx}}$, increases with cutoff value. However, for $n \\in \\mathbb{R}$, as the cutoff approaches $0$, $n_{\\mathrm{vmx}}$ approaches $-1$, while $\\mathrm{Var}(R)$ appears to grow without bound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5355\u4fa7\u622a\u65ad\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5361\u65b9\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5747\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5747\u503c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u4fa7\u622a\u65ad\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u6781\u9650\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bc1\u660e\u5355\u4fa7\u622a\u65ad\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u7f29\u653e\u5361\u65b9\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5355\u4fa7\u622a\u65ad\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u4e3a(M-a)\u00b2\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f29\u653e\u5361\u65b9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728n=1\u4e14a=0\u65f6\u65b9\u5dee\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u503cM\u00b2(\u03c0-2)/2\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u622a\u65ad\u503c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f7f\u65b9\u5dee\u6700\u5927\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6570\u4e5f\u968f\u4e4b\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u4fa7\u622a\u65ad\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u786e\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6700\u5927\u503c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5747\u503c\u3001\u622a\u65ad\u70b9\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Starting from a high-fidelity multiphysics percolation model, describing fluid flow, solute transport, solid, liquid reactions, and heat exchange within the coffee bed, we derive a reduced forward operator mapping controllable brewing parameters to the concentrations of the main chemical species in the cup. From a mathematical standpoint, we formalize the structural requirements for the local solvability of inverse problems, providing a minimal analytical condition for the existence of a (local) inverse map: continuous differentiability of the forward operator and a locally constant, nondegenerate Jacobian rank. Under these assumptions, the Constant Rank Theorem ensures that the image of the forward operator is a smooth embedded manifold on which well-defined local right-inverses exist.\n  Extensive experiments, including off-grid validation, show that the learned inverse map accurately reconstructs brewing temperature, grind size, and powder composition.

The reserve level of each line is modeled using a diffusion approximation, with the insurer's objective being to maximize the weighted total discounted dividends paid until the first ruin time. We obtain the value function and the optimal strategies in closed form. We then prove that the optimal dividend payout strategy for bounded dividend rates is of threshold type, while for unbounded dividend rates it is of barrier type. The optimal combination of proportional and excess-of-loss reinsurance is shown to be pure excess-of-loss reinsurance. We also show that the optimal level of risk ceded to the reinsurer decreases as the aggregate reserve level increases. The optimal capital injection strategy involves transferring reserves to prevent the ruin of one line.

Bargagli Stoffi"], "title": "Estimating the Effects of Heatwaves on Health: A Causal Inference Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "The harmful relationship between heatwaves and health has been extensively documented in medical and epidemiological literature. However, most evidence is associational and cannot be interpreted causally unless strong assumptions are made. In this paper, we first make explicit the assumptions underlying the statistical methods frequently used in the heatwave literature and demonstrate when these assumptions might break down in heatwave contexts. To address these shortcomings, we propose a causal inference framework that transparently elicits causal identification assumptions. Within this new framework, we first introduce synthetic controls (SC) for estimating heatwave effects, then propose a spatially augmented Bayesian synthetic control (SA-SC) method that accounts for spatial dependence and spillovers. Empirical Monte Carlo simulations show both methods perform well, with SA-SC reducing root mean squared error and improving posterior interval coverage under spillovers and spatial dependence. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to estimate the causal effects of heatwaves on Medicare heat-related hospitalizations among 13,753,273 beneficiaries residing in Northeastern U.S. from 2000 to 2019.

In the forward method, the value functional corresponds to an unnormalized density that is upper bounded by the unnormalized filtering density. Both methods can be combined to arrive at a variational two-filter formula. Additionally, it is noted that optimal variational filtering is generally of quadratic time-complexity in the sequence length. This motivates the notion of sub-optimal variational filtering, which also lower bounds the evidence but is of linear time-complexity. Another problem is the fact that the value functional recursions are generally intractable. This is briefly discussed and a simple approximation is suggested that retrieves the filter proposed by Courts et al. (2021). The methodology is examined in a jump Gauss--Markov system, where it is observed that the value functional recursions are tractable under a certain factored Markov process approximation. A simulation study demonstrates that the posterior approximation is of adequate quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53d8\u5206\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u4e24\u79cd\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u9012\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u63a8\u5bfc\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u9012\u63a8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u5206\u53cc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u53d8\u5206\u6ee4\u6ce2\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u4f18\u53d8\u5206\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8df3\u8dc3\u9ad8\u65af-\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d8\u5206\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u540e\u5411\u9012\u63a8\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We formalize eligibility-constrained bipartite experiments and define estimands aligned with full deployment: the Primary Total Treatment Effect (PTTE) on eligible units and the Secondary Total Treatment Effect (STTE) on ineligible units. Under randomization within the eligible set, we give identification conditions and develop interference-aware ensemble estimators that combine exposure mappings, generalized propensity scores, and flexible machine learning. We further introduce a projection that links treatment- and outcome-level estimands; this mapping is exact under a Linear Additive Edges condition and enables estimation on the (typically much smaller) treatment side with deterministic aggregation to outcomes. In simulations with known ground truth across realistic exposure regimes, the proposed estimators recover PTTE and STTE with low bias and variance and reduce the bias that could arise when interference is ignored. Two field experiments illustrate practical relevance: our method corrects the direction of expected interference bias for a pre-specified metric in both studies and reverses the sign and significance of the primary decision metric in one case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u5904\u7406\u4fa7\u5355\u5143\u53ef\u88ab\u5206\u914d\u5904\u7406\u800c\u6240\u6709\u5355\u5143\u4ecd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ea7\u751f\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b26\u5408\u5168\u9762\u90e8\u7f72\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff08PTTE\u548cSTTE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bc6\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u66b4\u9732\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u5e7f\u4e49\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u611f\u77e5\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fde\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f4e\u504f\u501a\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u4e14\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u5355\u5143\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u501a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b0\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa eligibility-constrained bipartite \u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49 PTTE \u548c STTE \u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u66b4\u9732\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u5e7f\u4e49\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u5e72\u6270\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u6027\u8fb9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cbe\u786e\u8fde\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u66b4\u9732\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u504f\u501a\u548c\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e86\u5e72\u6270\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u504f\u501a\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9006\u8f6c\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u51b3\u7b56\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8c\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u8d44\u683c\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u5e76\u5b58\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Most existing studies evaluate these algorithms under the assumption of homogeneous platoons, i.e., when all platoon members adopt the same CACC. However, market competition is likely to result in vehicles from different manufacturers implementing distinct CACCs. This raises fundamental questions about whether heterogeneous vehicles can safely cooperate within a platoon and what performance can be achieved. To date, these questions have received little attention, as heterogeneous platoons are difficult to model and analyze. In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed platoons, i.e., platoons made of vehicles running heterogeneous CACCs, and we study their performance through simulation-based experiments. We consider mixtures of three well-established CACCs from the literature. In the first part of the paper, we study a single mixed platoon in isolation to understand the microscopic effects on safety: we evaluate the performance of various CACC-mixtures across speed change and emergency braking scenarios. In the second part, we examine a high-density ring-road scenario to assess macroscopic impacts on safety, comfort, and traffic throughput, especially comparing throughput results with those obtained from vehicles controlled by a standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or by human drivers. Our findings highlight that some combinations of CACCs can operate robustly and safely, while others exhibit critical limitations in safety, comfort, or efficiency. These results emphasize the need for careful system design and the development of theoretical frameworks for modeling heterogeneous platoons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u8f66\u8f86\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\uff08mixed platoons\uff09\u5728\u534f\u540c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5de1\u822a\u63a7\u5236\uff08CACC\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u79cdCACC\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u53ca\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u73af\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u5408\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5f02\u6784\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CACC\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u8f66\u961f\u4e3a\u540c\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u5382\u5546\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u53ef\u80fd\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540cCACC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f02\u6784\u8f66\u961f\u5171\u5b58\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7a76\u6df7\u5408CACC\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u4e09\u79cd\u6210\u719f\u7684CACC\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u7b49\u5fae\u89c2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u73af\u5f62\u9053\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u8212\u9002\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6ACC\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9bCACC\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u7ec4\u5408\u5219\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u8212\u9002\u6027\u6216\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8eACC\u6216\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eCACC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6784CACC\u8f66\u8f86\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u95f4\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672a\u6765\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u961f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u5382\u5546\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u3002"}}

We propose a quantum spectral method with polylogarithmic complexity for solving non-periodic boundary value problems with arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our method extends the recently proposed approach by Liu et al. (2025), in which periodic problems are discretised using truncated Fourier series. In such spectral methods, the discretisation of boundary value problems with constant coefficients leads to a set of algebraic equations in the Fourier space. We implement the respective diagonal solution operator by first approximating it with a polynomial and then quantum encoding the polynomial. The mapping between the physical and Fourier spaces is accomplished using the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). To impose zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, we double the domain size and reflect all physical fields antisymmetrically. The respective reflection matrix defines the quantum sine transform (QST) by pre- and post-multiplying with the QFT. For non-zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, the solution is decomposed into a boundary-conforming and a homogeneous part. The homogenous part is determined by solving a problem with a suitably modified forcing vector. We illustrate the basic approach with a Dirichlet-Poisson problem and demonstrate its generality by applying it to a fractional stochastic PDE for modelling spatial random fields. We discuss the circuit implementation of the proposed approach and provide numerical evidence confirming its polylogarithmic complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709polylogarithmic\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u4efb\u610fDirichlet\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u975e\u5468\u671f\u8fb9\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6b63\u5f26\u53d8\u6362\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u5468\u671f\u8fb9\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5177\u6709\u4efb\u610fDirichlet\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Liu\u7b49\u4eba\uff082025\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u622a\u65ad\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7ea7\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff08QFT\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u96f6Dirichlet\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u500d\u57df\u5e76\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u91cf\u5b50\u6b63\u5f26\u53d8\u6362\uff08QST\uff09\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u96f6\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u89e3\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u9f50\u6b21\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6e90\u9879\u6c42\u89e3\u9f50\u6b21\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eDirichlet-Poisson\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5206\u6570\u9636\u968f\u673aPDE\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684polylogarithmic\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5polylogarithmic\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u5468\u671f\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}
