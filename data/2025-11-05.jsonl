We evaluate NTHMC on a two-dimensional U(1) gauge\ntheory, analyzing how it scales and transfers to larger volumes and smaller\nlattice spacing. Controlled comparisons let us isolate architectural\ncontributions to sampling efficiency. Good designs can reduce autocorrelation\nand boost topological tunneling while maintaining favorable scaling.

During\ndisasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, human mobility patterns often\ndeviate from their normal states, which makes the task more challenging.\nHowever, existing works usually rely on limited data from a single city or\nspecific disaster, significantly restricting the model's generalization\ncapability in new scenarios. In fact, disasters are highly sudden and\nunpredictable, and any city may encounter new types of disasters without prior\nexperience. Therefore, we aim to develop a one-for-all model for mobility\ngeneration that can generalize to new disaster scenarios. However, building a\nuniversal framework faces two key challenges: 1) the diversity of disaster\ntypes and 2) the heterogeneity among different cities. In this work, we propose\na unified model for human mobility generation in natural disasters (named\nUniDisMob). To enable cross-disaster generalization, we design physics-informed\nprompt and physics-guided alignment that leverage the underlying common\npatterns in mobility changes after different disasters to guide the generation\nprocess. To achieve cross-city generalization, we introduce a meta-learning\nframework that extracts universal patterns across multiple cities through\nshared parameters and captures city-specific features via private parameters.\nExtensive experiments across multiple cities and disaster scenarios demonstrate\nthat our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving\nan average performance improvement exceeding 13%."}

Existing estimators either assume\nnoninformative covariate censoring, where time of study exit is independent of\ntime of diagnosis, or allow informative covariate censoring, but require\ncorrectly specifying how these times are related.

A secondary, summary relationship is\nHeaps' law, which states that the number of types scales sublinearly with the\ntotal number of observed tokens present in a growing system. Here, we propose\nan idealized model of a growing system that (1) deterministically produces\narbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, and (2) allows us to\ndetermine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship.

Many properties of the topological-ordered states still\nawait a clear understanding, and nature of phase transition dynamics is one of\nthem. Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with\nnucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding\nnucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal\nthat the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a\nfundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by\na global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call\na flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a\ntriangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the\nphase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is\nrequired to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the\ntopological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must\nspend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the\nsystem, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of\ntriplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually\nsmall Avrami exponent $\\sim0.5$.

Leveraging\nmobile phone data and building upon recent insights into universal mobility\npatterns, we assess whether the general structure of population flows persists\nduring the extreme floods that struck Emilia-Romagna, Italy, in 2023. Our\nanalysis reveals that the relationship between visitor density, distance, and\nvisitation frequency remains robust even under extreme flooding conditions. To\ndisentangle the effects of distance and visitation frequency, we define two\naggregated visitor densities: the marginal density over frequency and the\naggregated density over distance.

The key\nfeature of our model is a spatio-temporal kernel that aggregates the predictor\nover local space-time neighborhoods, built directly into the likelihood,\neliminating any separate gap-filling or forced data alignment stage. We\nintroduce a numerical approximation using a Voronoi-based spatial quadrature\ncombined with irregular temporal increments for estimation under data\nmissingness and misalignment.

This method presumes that\nthe relationship between the potential outcomes of the treated and control\nunits remains consistent before and after treatment. However, the estimator may\nbecome unreliable when these relationships shift or when control units are\nhighly correlated. To address these challenges, we introduce the\nDistributionally Robust Synthetic Control (DRoSC) method by accommodating\npotential shifts in relationships and addressing high correlations among\ncontrol units. The DRoSC method targets a new causal estimand defined as the\noptimizer of a worst-case optimization problem that checks through all possible\nsynthetic weights that comply with the pre-treatment period. When the\nidentification conditions for the classical synthetic control method hold, the\nDRoSC method targets the same causal effect as the synthetic control. When\nthese conditions are violated, we show that this new causal estimand is a\nconservative proxy of the non-identifiable causal effect. We further show that\nthe limiting distribution of the DRoSC estimator is non-normal and propose a\nnovel inferential approach to characterize this non-normal limiting\ndistribution.

Many properties of the topological-ordered states still\nawait a clear understanding, and nature of phase transition dynamics is one of\nthem. Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with\nnucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding\nnucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal\nthat the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a\nfundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by\na global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call\na flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a\ntriangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the\nphase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is\nrequired to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the\ntopological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must\nspend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the\nsystem, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of\ntriplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually\nsmall Avrami exponent $\\sim0.5$.

This limitation is a challenge for navigation in\n3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a\none-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns\n(interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a\n3-dimensional space -yet preserving the same resolution- requires roughly\n$O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards,\ndense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate\nmemory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly\nrecognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so\nfar. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a\nlayer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for\nthe internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the\nMEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with\npairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense\nBattaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body\ninteractions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of\nstatistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -analytically- that such\neffective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological\nplausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors;\nfurthermore, we prove -numerically- that the present neural network is capable\nof recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional\nspace."}
