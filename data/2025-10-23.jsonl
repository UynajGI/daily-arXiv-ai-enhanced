Under certain conditions, they exhibit the tendency\nto self-organize through coordinated movements, such as swarming via\naggregation. While performing non-cooperative foraging tasks, the emergence of\nsuch swarming behavior in foragers, exemplifying active particles, has been\nattributed to the partial observability of the environment, in which the\npresence of another forager can serve as a proxy signal to indicate the\npotential presence of a food source or a resource patch. In this paper, we\nvalidate this phenomenon by simulating multiple self-propelled foragers as they\nforage from multiple resource patches in a non-cooperative manner. These\nforagers operate in a continuous two-dimensional space with stochastic position\nupdates and partial observability. We evolve a shared policy in the form of a\ncontinuous-time recurrent neural network that serves as a velocity controller\nfor the foragers. To this end, we use an evolutionary strategy algorithm\nwherein the different samples of the policy-distribution are evaluated in the\nsame rollout. Then we show that agents are able to learn to adaptively forage\nin the environment. Next, we show the emergence of swarming in the form of\naggregation among the foragers when resource patches are absent. We observe\nthat the strength of this swarming behavior appears to be inversely\nproportional to the amount of resource stored in the foragers, which supports\nthe risk-sensitive foraging claims. Empirical analysis of the learned\ncontroller's hidden states in minimal test runs uncovers their sensitivity to\nthe amount of resource stored in a forager.

Building on the theoretical work of Haerter and\nShastry [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,087202 (2005)], we explore the impact of\nkinetically frustrated magnetism, a phenomenon where antiferromagnetic order\nemerges without any underlying magnetic interactions, at finite hole density.\nWe numerically study the infinite-$U$ triangular Hubbard model using the\ndensity matrix renormalization group algorithm and estimate the extent of\nstability of the kinetically induced $120^{\\circ}$ antiferromagnetic state to\nhole doping. Beyond the Haerter-Shastry regime, we find an intermediate phase\nwith multimer (involving multiple correlated spins) stripes that eventually\ngives way to a paramagnet. We also find evidence of gapless charge excitations\n(metallicity) throughout the phase diagram for finite hole density. We discuss\nthe implications at large, but finite and realistic values of $U/t$, and\ninvestigate whether kinetic magnetism and superexchange collaborate or compete."}

Despite extensive research on\nurban delivery optimization, little is known about the trade-off between\nindividual convenience and these societal costs. In this study, we investigate\nthe value of marginal extensions in delivery times, termed customer patience,\nin mitigating the traffic burden caused by grocery deliveries. We first\nconceptualize the problem and present a mathematical model that highlights a\nconvex relationship between patience and traffic congestion. The theoretical\npredictions are confirmed by an extensive, network-science based analysis\nleveraging two large-scale datasets encompassing over 8 million grocery orders\nin Dubai. Our findings reveal that allowing just five additional minutes in\ndelivery time reduces daily delivery mileage by approximately 30 percent and\nlife-cycle CO2 emissions by 20 percent.

Second, we evaluate if a user's demographic\ncharacteristics influence the probability that their texts are misclassified.\nOur analysis indicates that authorship attribution does not demonstrate bias\nacross demographic groups in the closed-world setting. Third, we evaluate the\ntypes of errors that occur when the true author is removed from the suspect\nset, thereby forcing the classifier to choose an incorrect author. Unlike the\nfirst two settings, this analysis demonstrates a tendency to attribute\nauthorship to users who share the same demographic characteristic as the true\nauthor. Crucially, these errors do not only include texts that deviate from a\nuser's usual style, but also those that are very close to the author's average.\nOur results highlight that though a model may appear fair in the closed-world\nsetting for a performant classifier, this does not guarantee fairness when\nerrors are inevitable."}

Specifically, we\nsplit the Fock-space into subspaces, potential-energy shells, which contain the\naccessible phase space for the relaxation of a quenched initial state.

Upon crossing\nover from weak to strong disorder, $W>W_c$, the potential-energy shell decays\ninto fragments; we argue that, unlike percolation, fragmentation is a\nstrong-coupling scenario with turn-around flow: $W_c(L)$ diverges with\nincreasing system size.

First, we show that any dynamic\noutput-feedback controller is equivalent to a static partial-state feedback\ngain for a new system representation characterized by a finite-length IOH.\nLeveraging this equivalence, we reformulate the search for an optimal dynamic\noutput feedback controller as an optimization problem over the corresponding\npartial-state feedback gain. Next, we introduce a relaxed version of the\nIOH-based LQG problem by incorporating a small process noise with covariance\n$\\epsilon I$ into the new system to ensure coerciveness, a key condition for\nestablishing gradient-based convergence guarantees.

It leads to non-ergodic dynamics\nand possible breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Here, we\ndemonstrate that also in disordered systems, such as the XXZ model with random\non-site fields, fragmentation appears as a natural concept offering fresh\nperspectives, for example, on many-body delocalization (MBdL). Specifically, we\nsplit the Fock-space into subspaces, potential-energy shells, which contain the\naccessible phase space for the relaxation of a quenched initial state. In this\nconstruction, dynamical observables reflect properties of the shell geometry,\ne.g., the drastic sample-to-sample fluctuations observed in the weak disorder\nregime, $W<W_c$, represent fluctuations of the mass of the shell. Upon crossing\nover from weak to strong disorder, $W>W_c$, the potential-energy shell decays\ninto fragments; we argue that, unlike percolation, fragmentation is a\nstrong-coupling scenario with turn-around flow: $W_c(L)$ diverges with\nincreasing system size. We conjecture that the slowing down of the relaxation\ndynamics reported in traditional MBdL studies is (essentially) a manifestation\nof Fock-space fragmentation introduced here."}
