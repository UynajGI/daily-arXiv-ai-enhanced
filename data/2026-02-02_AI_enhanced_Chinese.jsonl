In this work, we proposed a family of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based data-driven models that do not require detailed knowledge of the composition of the battery materials but can essentially capture the non-linear dynamics with higher computational efficiency. Only voltage and current data obtained from hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests were utilized to form the state space matrices and subsequently used for predicting the future terminal voltage at different state of charge (SoC) and aging levels. To construct the system model, 60\\% of the data from a single HPPC test was utilized to generate time-delay embedded snapshots, with embedding dimension ranging from 40 to 2000. Among these, an embedding dimension of 1810 resulted in the least residual sum of squares (RSS) error of 3.86 for the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model and 30 for the standard DMD model. For DMDc model, delay embeddings (ranging from 1 to 12) were also incorporated into the input current signals. For the input matrix, an embedding dimension of 6 resulted in a minimum RSS error of 1.74. Furthermore, the system matrices A and B, identified from the HPPC test when the cell is in its healthy state, were held fixed and used to simulate the system dynamics for aged batteries by updating only the control input. Despite the presence of nonlinear degradation effects in later cycles, the DMDc model effectively captured key inner dynamics such as voltage dips and transient responses for subsequent charge and discharge cycles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\uff08DMD\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u538b\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8377\u7535\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8001\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u7aef\u7535\u538b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6750\u6599\u7ec6\u8282\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\uff08DMD\uff09\u548c\u5e26\u63a7\u5236\u7684DMD\uff08DMDc\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528HPPC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u538b\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u6784\u9020\u5feb\u7167\uff1b\u4f7f\u752860%\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u5e73\u65b9\u548c\uff08RSS\uff09\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635A\u548cB\u5728\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u540e\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u8001\u5316\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "DMDc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u6570\u4e3a1810\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f4eRSS\u8bef\u5dee3.86\uff0c\u6807\u51c6DMD\u4e3a30\uff1b\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u6570\u4e3a6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94RSS\u4e3a1.74\uff1b\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7535\u538b\u9aa4\u964d\u548c\u77ac\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7535\u6c60\u8001\u5316\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DMDc\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cSOC\u548c\u8001\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u7535\u6c60\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u4e8e\u7535\u6c60\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002"}}

We propose an algorithm that combines a decaying-$\u03b5$-greedy stream switching rule with an efficient change-point detection algorithm for unknown post-change means. We provide bounds on the expected detection delay and average run length to false alarm for our algorithm, and based on these results we prove our algorithm is approximately optimal with respect to a commonly used surrogate.

In response, many have adopted community-based content moderation systems, including Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch) on X (formerly Twitter), Footnotes on TikTok, and Facebook's Community Notes initiative. However, research shows that the current design of these systems can allow political biases to influence both the development of notes and the rating processes, reducing their overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that enabling users to collaborate on writing notes, rather than relying solely on individually authored notes, can enhance their overall quality. To test this idea, we conducted an online experiment in which participants jointly authored notes on political posts. Our results show that teams produce notes that are rated as more helpful than individually written notes.

The core method, Iteratively Reweighted Fused Lasso (IRFL), improves upon the generalized lasso by adaptively reweighting penalties to enhance support recovery and minimize criteria such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The approach allows for flexible modeling of seasonal patterns, linear and quadratic trends, and autoregressive dependence in the presence of changepoints.\n  Simulation studies demonstrate that IRFL achieves accurate changepoint detection across a wide range of challenging scenarios, including those involving nuisance factors such as trends, seasonal patterns, and serially correlated errors. The framework is further extended to image data, where it enables edge-preserving denoising and segmentation, with applications spanning medical imaging and high-throughput plant phenotyping.\n  Applications to real-world data demonstrate IRFL's utility. In particular, analysis of the Mauna Loa CO2 time series reveals changepoints that align with volcanic eruptions and ENSO events, yielding a more accurate trend decomposition than ordinary least squares. Overall, IRFL provides a robust, extensible tool for detecting structural change in complex data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eL0\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u5957\u7d22\uff08IRFL\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u76f8\u5173\u8bef\u5dee\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u5957\u7d22\uff08IRFL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u60e9\u7f5a\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u652f\u6301\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408BIC\u7b49\u51c6\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u5efa\u6a21\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u3001\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eIRFL\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4fdd\u8fb9\u53bb\u566a\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\uff1b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5bf9Mauna Loa CO2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u53d8\u70b9\u4e0e\u706b\u5c71\u55b7\u53d1\u53caENSO\u4e8b\u4ef6\u543b\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "IRFL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Classical features are extracted and reduced via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enable efficient quantum encoding. The reduced feature vectors are embedded into a quantum kernel-induced feature space using a fully entangled ZZFeatureMap and classified using a kernel based QSVM. Performance is first evaluated on a quantum simulator and subsequently validated on NISQ-era superconducting quantum hardware, specifically the IBM Torino (133-qubit) and IBM Fez (156-qubit) processors. Experimental results demonstrate that the QSVM achieves competitive classification performance relative to classical SVM baselines while operating on substantially reduced feature dimensionality. Hardware experiments reveal the impact of noise and decoherence and measurement shot count on quantum kernel estimation, and further show improved stability and fidelity on newer Heron r2 architecture. This study provides a systematic comparison between simulator-based and hardware-based QSVM implementations and highlights both the feasibility and current limitations of deploying quantum kernel methods for practical radar signal classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08QSVM\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u96f7\u8fbe\u7a7a\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PCA\u964d\u7ef4\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\uff08IBM Torino\u548cFez\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eQSVM\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178SVM\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u6b21\u6570\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524dNISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u53d6\u7ecf\u5178\u5fae\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528PCA\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u7ef4\uff0c\u5229\u7528ZZFeatureMap\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eQSVM\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cIBM\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "QSVM\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178SVM\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6b21\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\u6838\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u65b0\u578bHeron r2\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f53\u524dNISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Yet, their reserve controllers remain vulnerable to regime-blind optimization, calibrating risk parameters on fair-weather data while ignoring tail events that precipitate cascading failures. The March 2020 Black Thursday collapse, wherein MakerDAO's collateral auctions yielded $8.3M in losses and a 15% peg deviation, exposed a critical gap: existing models like SAS systematically omit extreme volatility regimes from covariance estimates, producing allocations optimal in expectation but catastrophic under adversarial stress.\n  We present MVF-Composer, a trust-weighted Mean-Variance Frontier reserve controller incorporating a novel Stress Harness for risk-state estimation. Our key insight is deploying multi-agent simulations as adversarial stress-testers: heterogeneous agents (traders, liquidity providers, attackers) execute protocol actions under crisis scenarios, exposing reserve vulnerabilities before they manifest on-chain. We formalize a trust-scoring mechanism T: A -> [0,1] that down-weights signals from agents exhibiting manipulative behavior, ensuring the risk-state estimator remains robust to signal injection and Sybil attacks.\n  Across 1,200 randomized scenarios with injected Black-Swan shocks (10% collateral drawdown, 50% sentiment collapse, coordinated redemption attacks), MVF-Composer reduces peak peg deviation by 57% and mean recovery time by 3.1x relative to SAS baselines. Ablation studies confirm the trust layer accounts for 23% of stability gains under adversarial conditions, achieving 72% adversarial agent detection.

As quasiparticles can be generated directly within a material, the swarm size can be adjusted with minimal energy overhead. Using an optimization task defined by a spatially varying temperature landscape, we quantitatively show that interacting swarms reliably identify global optima and significantly outperform non-interacting searchers within a well-defined regime of interaction strength and swarm size. This improvement arises from emergent cooperative behavior, where local interactions guide the swarm toward high-quality solutions without central coordination. To link our physical model to experimental realizations, we coarse-grain the quasiparticle dynamics onto a sensor lattice and generate trajectories emulating particle-tracking measurements. We further show that the interacting swarm adapts robustly to landscapes that evolve over time.

Under the assumption of exact unstable eigenvectors, we establish a local linear convergence of the discrete constrained saddle dynamics and show that the convergence rate depends on the condition number of the Riemannian Hessian. To mitigate this dependence, we introduce a momentum-based constrained saddle dynamics and prove local convergence of the continuous-time dynamics as well as the corresponding discrete scheme, which further demonstrates that momentum accelerates convergence, particularly in ill-conditioned settings. In addition, we show that a single-step eigenvector update is sufficient to guarantee local convergence; thus, the assumption of exact unstable eigenvectors is not necessary, which substantially reduces the computational cost.

There are open questions, however, about how to implement adaptive design approaches when the primary endpoint is a win ratio, including in group sequential designs. A key requirement allowing for straightforward application of classical group sequential methods is the independence of incremental interim test statistics. This paper derives the covariance structure of incremental U-statistics that evaluate the win ratio under its asymptotic distribution. The derived covariance shows that the independent increments assumption holds for the asymptotic distribution of U-statistics that test the win ratio. Simulations confirm that traditional $\u03b1$-spending preserves Type I error across interim looks. A retrospective look at the IN.PACT SFA clinical trial data illustrates the potential for stopping early in a group sequential design using the win ratio. We have demonstrated that straightforward use of Lan-De\\uppercase{M}ets $\u03b1$-spending is possible for randomized trials involving the win ratio under certain common conditions.

While pre Generative AI supervised encoder based models became the de facto standard for large scale patent classification, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) raise questions about whether they can provide complementary capabilities, particularly for rare or weakly represented technological categories. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of encoder based classifiers (BERT, SciBERT, and PatentSBERTa) and open weight LLMs on a highly imbalanced benchmark dataset (USPTO 70k). We evaluate LLMs under zero shot, few shot, and retrieval augmented prompting, and further assess parameter efficient fine tuning of the best performing model. Our results show that encoder based models achieve higher aggregate performance, driven by strong results on frequent CPC subclasses, but struggle on rare ones. In contrast, LLMs achieve relatively higher performance on infrequent subclasses, often associated with early stage, cross domain, or weakly institutionalised technologies, particularly at higher hierarchical levels. These findings indicate that encoder based and LLM based approaches play complementary roles in patent classification. We additionally quantify inference time and energy consumption, showing that encoder based models are up to three orders of magnitude more efficient than LLMs. Overall, our results inform responsible patentometrics and technology mapping, and motivate hybrid classification approaches that combine encoder efficiency with the long tail coverage of LLMs under computational and environmental constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u4e13\u5229\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u8005\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u800cLLM\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u6280\u672f\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4e13\u5229\u5206\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f31\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u8865\u5145\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728USPTO 70k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982BERT\u3001SciBERT\u3001PatentSBERTa\uff09\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u53ca\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5f97\u76ca\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891CPC\u5b50\u7c7b\u7684\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a00\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u800cLLM\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u5b50\u7c7b\uff08\u5e38\u5bf9\u5e94\u65b0\u5174\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6216\u5236\u5ea6\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff09\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ea7\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u6bd4LLM\u9ad8\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548cLLM\u5728\u4e13\u5229\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6548\u7387\u4e0eLLM\u957f\u5c3e\u8986\u76d6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u4e13\u5229\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

A central challenge is to distill these universal characteristics from model-specific ones. Random quantum states sampled from a uniform distribution, the Haar measure, provide a powerful framework for capturing this typicality. Here, we experimentally study the entanglement and symmetries of random many-body quantum states generated by evolving simple product states under ergodic Floquet models. We find excellent agreement with the predictions from the Haar-random state ensemble. First, we measure the R\u00e9nyi-2 entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem size, observing the Page curve. Second, we probe the subsystem symmetries using entanglement asymmetry. Finally, we measure the moments of partially transposed reduced density matrices obtained by tracing out part of the system in the generated ensembles, thereby revealing distinct entanglement phases.

Case analysis shows both models exhibit similar large-scale error growth in the extratropics, suggesting prediction skill bounded by similar limits despite model differences in spatial resolution and parameterized physics. Aggregated statistics reveal that low skill of Week-2 forecasts may occur after TC genesis, regardless of whether they recurve or not. While recurving tracks are established error sources, zonal-track clusters can be associated with similarly profound forecast degradation, acting through Rossby wave dynamics and remote moisture transport mechanisms.

A particularly useful version is that of forecasting: determining a causal filter that estimates a future value of a hidden process from past observations. Current techniques for deriving the filter require that the noise be well described by rational power spectra. However, scale-free noises, whose spectra scale as a non-integer power of frequency, are ubiquitous in practice.

Under the high-dimensional setting, most of the existing research has focused on identifying change points in historical data. However, there is a significant lack of studies on the practically relevant online change point problem, which means promptly detecting change points as they occur. In this paper, applying the limiting theory of linear spectral statistics for random matrices, we propose a class of spectrum based CUSUM-type statistic. We first construct a martingale from the difference of linear spectral statistics of sequential sample Fisher matrices, which converges to a Brownian motion. Our CUSUM-type statistic is then defined as the maximum of a variant of this process. Finally, we develop our detection procedure based on the invariance principle. Simulation results show that our detection method is highly sensitive to the occurrence of change point and is able to identify it shortly after they arise, outperforming the existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u7684CUSUM\u578b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7ebf\u6027\u8c31\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6781\u9650\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eFisher\u77e9\u9635\u8c31\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9785\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49CUSUM\u578b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u539f\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u53d8\u70b9\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53d8\u70b9\u51fa\u73b0\u540e\u8fc5\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u7684CUSUM\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5728\u7ebf\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Observational studies often have more than two treatments, but corresponding analysis methods are limited. In this paper, we combine the propensity score weighting method for multiple treatments and a marginal Cox model with indicators for each treatment to estimate the causal hazard ratios between multiple treatments and a common reference treatment. We illustrate two weighting schemes: inverse probability of treatment weighting and overlap weighting. We prove the consistency of the maximum weighted partial likelihood estimator of the causal marginal hazard ratio and derive a robust sandwich variance estimator.

While classical thermodynamics successfully describes equilibrium phenomenologically, the realization of thermal distributions requires concrete microscopic mechanisms provided by quantum electrodynamics. We derive the Boltzmann distribution from a minimal differential scaling postulate and show that sustaining thermal equilibrium demands continuous photon exchange with average energy $\\langle h\u03bd\\rangle = 2.701\\,E_c$, quantifying the energetic throughput necessary to counter radiative losses. Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium. We establish physical criteria distinguishing genuine thermal equilibrium from purely formal temperature assignments and demonstrate that the classical notion of an infinite thermal reservoir emerges as an effective idealization within a hierarchy of dynamically maintained photon baths. This photonic framework complements phenomenological thermodynamics by providing its microscopic foundation and clarifies the physical meaning of temperature as an emergent collective property of photon-mediated energy exchange.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5149\u5b50\u662f\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u7269\u8d28\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u4ece\u5fae\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0e\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7269\u7406\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u5fae\u5206\u6807\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u5bfc\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5149\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u4e0e\u975e\u5f39\u6027\u6563\u5c04\u5728\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7ef4\u6301\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf\u4e3a2.701\u500d\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u6301\u7eed\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u6e90\u4e8e\u9ad8\u80fd\u5149\u5b50\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u80fd\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u662f\u5149\u5b50\u4ecb\u5bfc\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u96c6\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u5b50\u6d74\u7684\u7ef4\u6301\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u5e93\u6982\u5ff5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002"}}

However, existing static policies fail to address a fundamental tension: algorithms suffer from stochastic ``reliability drift,'' while human override capacity is scarce and congestible. We formulate the management of such systems as a dynamic queueing control problem. The system state is defined by the tuple (queue backlog, reliability regime), and the control variable is a state-dependent risk threshold. We prove that the optimal escalation policy is driven by the endogenous ``Shadow Price of Capacity.'' We establish two key structural monotonicity results: (i) Congestion Shedding, where the threshold rises with backlog to sacrifice marginal accuracy for responsiveness; and (ii) Safety Buffering, where the threshold lowers during drift to use the queue as a ``risk capacitor.'' Furthermore, we identify a critical ``Capacity Phase Transition'' in the arrival-drift parameter space, beyond which no policy can maintain safety standards without causing structural system failure (infinite queues).

However, finite-time MCMC estimators are biased, and reducing this bias typically comes at a higher computational cost. We propose a multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimator whose bias decays as $O(T_{n}^{-1} )$ while its expected computational cost grows only as $O(log T_n )$, where $T_n$ is the maximal truncation level at iteration n. Building on this approach, we introduce a multilevel MCMC framework for adaptive stochastic gradient methods, leading to new multilevel variants of Adagrad and AMSGrad algorithms. Under conditions controlling the estimator bias and its second and third moments, we establish a convergence rate of order $O(n^{-1/2} )$ up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we illustrate these results on Importance-Weighted Autoencoders trained with the proposed multilevel adaptive methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5c42\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\uff08MCMC\uff09\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u7684MCMC\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u504f\u5dee\u8870\u51cf\u4e3aO(T_n^{-1})\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u589e\u957f\u4e3aO(log T_n)\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u5c42MCMC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Adagrad\u548cAMSGrad\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u591a\u5c42\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u5176\u4e8c\u9636\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u77e9\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u4e3aO(n^{-1/2})\uff08\u6700\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Lanczos residual bounds address this by providing two-sided constraints on energies that do not require assumptions beyond Hermiticity, but often give very conservative systematic uncertainty estimates. Here, a more-constraining set of gap bounds is introduced for hadron spectroscopy. These bounds provide tighter constraints whose validity requires an explicit assumption about an energy gap. Exactly solvable lattice field theory correlators are used to test the utility of residual and gap bounds at finite and infinite statistics. Two-sided bounds and other analysis methods are then applied to a high-statistics LQCD calculation of nucleon-nucleon scattering at $m_\u03c0\\sim 800$ MeV. Generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) and Lanczos energy estimators are compatible when applied to the same correlator data, but analyses including different interpolating operators show statistically significant inconsistencies. However, two-sided bounds from all operators are consistent. Under the assumption that the number of energy levels below $N\u0394$ and $\u0394\u0394$ thresholds is the same as for non-interacting nucleons, gap bounds are sufficient to constrain nucleon-nucleon scattering amplitudes at phenomenologically relevant precision. Lanczos methods further reveal that energy-eigenstate estimates from previously studied asymmetric correlators have not converged over accessible imaginary times. Nevertheless, data-driven examples demonstrate why assumptions are required to draw conclusions about the natures of two-nucleon ground states at these masses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u95f4\u9699\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u683c\u70b9\u91cf\u5b50\u8272\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u591a\u5f3a\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eLanczos\u6b8b\u5dee\u754c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6838\u5b50-\u6838\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6fc0\u53d1\u95f4\u9699\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u683c\u70b9QCD\u8c31\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u5f3a\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u7ea6\u675f\u529b\u7684\u95f4\u9699\u8fb9\u754c\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u89e3\u7684\u683c\u70b9\u573a\u8bba\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6709\u9650\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u7edf\u8ba1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6b8b\u5dee\u754c\u548c\u95f4\u9699\u754c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408GEVP\u548cLanczos\u80fd\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6838\u5b50-\u6838\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u7684\u95f4\u9699\u754c\u6bd4Lanczos\u6b8b\u5dee\u754c tighter\uff0c\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u80fd\u7ea7\u6570\u4e0e\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6838\u5b50\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u4ee5\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u6838\u5b50-\u6838\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u63d2\u503c\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u53cc\u8fb9\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bLanczos\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u6b64\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u672a\u5728\u53ef\u53ca\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u5f15\u5165\u5047\u8bbe\u624d\u80fd\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u6b64\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u53cc\u6838\u5b50\u57fa\u6001\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u95f4\u9699\u754c\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

For a density operator $\u03c1$, projector $F$, and effect $E$, with gate-passage probability $s = {\\rm Tr}(\u03c1F)$ and commutator norm $\\varepsilon = \\|[F, E]\\|$, the symmetric partial-gating drift satisfies $|\u0394p_F(E)| \\leq 2 \\sqrt{(1 - s)/s} \\cdot \\varepsilon$. The constant 2 is sharp. We introduce two diagnostic quantities: the coherence witness $W(\u03c1, F) = \\|F \u03c1(I - F)\\|_1$, measuring cross-boundary coherence, and the record fidelity gap $\u0394_T(\u03c1_F, R)$, measuring expectation-value change under symmetrisation. Three experimental vignettes demonstrate falsifiability: Hong--Ou--Mandel interferometry, atomic energy-basis dephasing, and decoherence-induced classicality.

In this paper, we address the challenge of temporal bias in mobility data, which can skew the representation of mobility behaviors due to the event-based nature of location data sampling. We use the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to assess the accuracy of a place-based measure of economic segregation drawn from large-scale mobility data across 11 U.S. cities. We show that comparisons with high quality time use surveys such as the ATUS can validate behavioral insights from mobility data, while quantifying uncertainty and highlighting areas of relative instability in analytical findings.

Under review", "summary": "Covariance steering (CS) synthesizes a control policy which drives the state's mean and covariance matrix towards desired values. Offering tractable computation of a closed-loop policy which can obey chance constraints in uncertain environments, application to many real-world control problems have been proposed. We consider the chance-constrained, discrete-time, linear time-varying CS with Gaussian noise. The contribution of this paper is a novel solution method for this problem, explicitly writing the propagation equations of the Cholesky factor of the state covariance matrix by using the QR decomposition. The use of the square-root form of covariance matrices brings two key benefits over other existing methods: (i) computational scalability and (ii) numerical reliability. (i) Compared to solution methods that require large block matrix formulations, the proposed method scales better with the growth in horizon length, shows better optimality, and uses memoryless state feedback. (ii) Compared to another class of methods that explicitly define the covariance matrix as variables, the proposed method allows flexible cost formulations and shows better numerical reliability when uncertainty terms are smaller than the mean. On the other hand, these benefits come with a minor drawback: the propagation equation of covariance square roots is non-convex, necessitating sequential convex programming to solve.

Despite its success and various proposed extensions, a significant practical feature which has been overlooked in previous research is the potential skewed nature of the noise, or of the residuals when the predictive model exhibits bias. In this work, we leverage recent developments in CP to propose a new asymmetric procedure that bridges the gap between skewed and non-skewed noise distributions, while still maintaining adaptivity of the prediction intervals. We introduce a new statistical learning problem to construct adaptive and asymmetric prediction bands, with a unique feature based on a penalty which promotes symmetry: when its intensity varies, the intervals smoothly change from symmetric to asymmetric ones. This learning problem is based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and the recently introduced kernel sum-of-squares framework. First, we establish representer theorems to make our problem tractable in practice, and derive dual formulations which are essential for scalability to larger datasets. Second, the intensity of the penalty is chosen using a novel data-driven method which automatically identifies the symmetric nature of the noise. We show that consenting to some asymmetry can let the learned prediction bands better adapt to small sample regimes or biased predictive models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u504f\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u6b8b\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u504f\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6838\u5e73\u65b9\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5bf9\u5076\u5f62\u5f0f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6216\u6709\u504f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5141\u8bb8\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u659c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

LLM-based multi-agent systems mitigate the inefficiency of single agents in complex tasks. However, they still suffer from issues such as memory inconsistency and agent behavioral conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MiTa, a hierarchical memory-integrated task allocative framework to enhance collaborative efficiency. MiTa organizes agents into a manager-member hierarchy, where the manager incorporates additional allocation and summary modules that enable (1) global task allocation and (2) episodic memory integration. The allocation module enables the manager to allocate tasks from a global perspective, thereby avoiding potential inter-agent conflicts. The summary module, triggered by task progress updates, performs episodic memory integration by condensing recent collaboration history into a concise summary that preserves long-horizon context. By combining task allocation with episodic memory, MiTa attains a clearer understanding of the task and facilitates globally consistent task distribution. Experimental results confirm that MiTa achieves superior efficiency and adaptability in complex multi-agent cooperation over strong baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiTa\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u96c6\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ba1\u7406\u8005-\u6210\u5458\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u51b2\u7a81\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMiTa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7ba1\u7406\u8005-\u6210\u5458\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u5305\u542b\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6458\u8981\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5c55\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd1\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u5386\u53f2\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7b80\u6d01\u6458\u8981\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMiTa\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6574\u5408\u7684MiTa\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The physicist's correlation length $\u03be$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\u03b1$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\u03c7$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility.

We observe that when the frequency of the drive is significantly lower than that of the response and the driving strength is above a threshold, the Chua's circuit exhibits multiple stable attractors. The features of the attractors change as the driving strength \u03b5 increases, for instance the attractors are double-scroll at low \u03b5 and are single-scroll when \u03b5 is high. We also investigate generalized synchronization(GS) between the drive and the response systems by employing the auxiliary system approach. When the drive is much slower than the response, we observe different scenarios of remote synchronization(RS) between response and auxiliary units. In addition to complete synchrony between response and auxiliary systems indicating GS between drive and response, we notice that the response and auxiliary units can be lag synchronized and can also have correlated trajectories indicating novel forms of RS. The slow drive can induce multistability between these RS states which disappears as the frequency of drive increases and become equivalent to the response Chua's ciruit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6df7\u6c8c\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0bChua\u7535\u8def\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u9a71\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u4e14\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u540c\u6b65\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df7\u6c8c\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0bChua\u7535\u8def\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u540c\u6b65\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u51fa\u73b0\u53cc\u5377\u6216\u5355\u5377\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5f62\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u6ede\u540e\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u5173\u7b49\u8fdc\u7a0b\u540c\u6b65\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u6162\u901f\u9a71\u52a8\u53ef\u5f15\u53d1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u540c\u6b65\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdChua\u7535\u8def\u7684\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6162\u901f\u6df7\u6c8c\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u65b0\u578b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

We then move forward to extend the baseline case to agents capable of learning and adapting to an external reward signal, using reinforcement learning. Smart walkers morph the statistics of the encounter, to maximize their cumulated reward, as confirmed by combined numerical and analytical insights. More interestingly, configuration entropy proves a reliable proxy to gauge the acquired ability of the agents to cope with the assigned task when no other information about them (i.e. reward signal, policy, etc) is present.

Standard approaches typically optimize a single outcome criterion. For example, recommending treatment according to the sign of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) maximizes the policy \"value\" by exploiting treatment effect heterogeneity. This point of view shifts policy learning towards the challenge of learning a reliable CATE estimator. However, in multi-outcome settings, such strategies ignore the risk of adverse events, despite their relevance. PLUC (Policy Learning Under Constraint) addresses this challenges by learning an estimator of the CATE that yields smoothed policies controlling the probability of an adverse event in observational settings. Inspired by insights from EP-learning, PLUC involves the optimization of strongly convex Lagrangian criteria over a convex hull of functions. Its alternating procedure iteratively applies the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to minimize the current criterion, then performs a targeting step that updates the criterion so that its evaluations at previously visited landmarks become targeted estimators of the corresponding theoretical quantities. An R package PLUC-R provides a practical implementation. We illustrate PLUC's performance through a series of numerical experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "PLUC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5f3a\u51f8\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51c6\u5219\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u5e73\u5747\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff08CATE\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u57fa\u4e8eCATE\u7b26\u53f7\u5236\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u7ed3\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002PLUC\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7597\u6548\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "PLUC\u53d7EP-learning\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5f3a\u51f8\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51c6\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Frank-Wolfe\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5f53\u524d\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u65b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u4f7f\u51c6\u5219\u5728\u5df2\u8bbf\u95ee\u70b9\u5904\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u91cf\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\u3002", "result": "PLUC\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u6982\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86R\u8bed\u8a00\u5305PLUC-R\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "PLUC\u4e3a\u591a\u7ed3\u5c40\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u653f\u7b56\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, most functions lack closed-form proximal operators, which has long restricted these methods to a narrow set of problems. Hamilton-Jacobi-based proximal operator (HJ-Prox) is a recent derivative-free Monte Carlo technique based on Hamilton-Jacobi PDE theory, that approximates proximal operators numerically. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for operator splitting via HJ-Prox, which allows for deployment of operator splitting even when functions are not proximable. We prove that replacing exact proximal steps with HJ-Prox in algorithms such as proximal point, proximal gradient descent, Douglas-Rachford splitting, Davis-Yin splitting, and primal-dual hybrid gradient preserves convergence guarantees under mild assumptions.

The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime.

However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $\u03b2$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \\lesssim 10\\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape.

The well-posedness of the discrete formulation and the corresponding a priori error estimate are proved using a discrete inf-sup condition.

Previous work has shown that the sensitivity to bias can be reduced by dividing a dataset into a planning sample and a larger analysis sample, where the planning sample guides design decisions. But the choice of what fraction of the data to put in the planning sample vs. the analysis sample was ad hoc. Here, we develop an approach to find the optimal fraction using plasmode datasets.

We develop a set of mathematical tools for reasoning about visibility as a function of position and rely on non-smooth analysis to formally characterize the regularity properties of various visibility-based metrics. These metrics are non-smooth and non-convex, so off-the-shelf optimization algorithms can only guarantee convergence to Clarke critical points. To address this, the proposed Normalized Descent algorithm leverages the structure of non-smooth points in visibility problems and introduces randomness to escape saddle points. Our technical analysis allows for the non-monotonic decrease in the visibility metric and strengthens the algorithm guarantees, ensuring convergence to local minima with high probability. Simulations on two hide-and-seek scenarios showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u969c\u788d\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u9690\u85cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u3001\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u9003\u79bb\u978d\u70b9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u624b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u672a\u77e5\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u5b54\u6d1e\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u5206\u6790\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51fd\u6570\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u975e\u51f8\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u4ec5\u6536\u655b\u81f3Clarke\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6349\u8ff7\u85cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u9690\u853d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9690\u85cf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6297\u89c6\u7ebf\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

It prevents spurious findings and enables controlled feature selection. Recent CIT methods have used machine learning (ML) models as surrogates of the underlying distribution. However, model-agnostic approaches require a train-test split, which reduces statistical power. We introduce Semi-knockoffs, a CIT method that can accommodate any pre-trained model, avoids this split, and provides valid p-values and false discovery rate (FDR) control for high-dimensional settings. Unlike methods that rely on the model-$X$ assumption (known input distribution), Semi-knockoffs only require conditional expectations for continuous variables. This makes the procedure less restrictive and more practical for machine learning integration.

Nonlinear relaxation in a wide variety of natural systems proceeds through metastable states, which arise in condensed-matter physics as well as in fields ranging from cosmology and biology to high-energy physics. Moreover, noise-induced phenomena play a central role in shaping the dynamics of such systems far from equilibrium. This review develops a unifying perspective centered on noise-assisted stabilization and the statistical properties of metastable dynamics. We first discuss escape processes driven by L\u00e9vy flights in smooth metastable potentials, emphasizing the emergence of nonmonotonic residence-time behavior. We then connect these concepts to stochastic resistive switching in memristive devices, where noise-induced effects can enhance stability and reproducibility. We further examine driven dissipative quantum bistability, showing how the interplay between external driving and system-environment coupling reshapes escape pathways and lifetimes. Finally, we outline how switching-time statistics in current-biased Josephson junctions can provide an experimentally accessible strategy for axion detection, based on an axion-induced resonant-activation signature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u5728\u591a\u4f53\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4ece\u7ecf\u5178\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5f1b\u8c6b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u6784\u578b\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6da8\u843d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7f13\u6162\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5f1b\u8c6b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba8\u8bbaL\u00e9vy\u98de\u884c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9003\u9038\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7535\u963b\u5207\u6362\u3001\u9a71\u52a8\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e9a\u7a33\u52bf\u4e2d\u7531L\u00e9vy\u98de\u884c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u9a7b\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff1b\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf-\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u5bff\u547d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f74\u5b50\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5171\u632f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u8f74\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u8c03\u63a7\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f1b\u8c6b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e5f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5982\u8f74\u5b50\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

The distortion of the spiral by small in-plane magnetic field is described analytically. It is found that the field can gradually change the vector of the magnetic structure ${\\bf k}_0$ and can produce transitions between phases with incommensurate and commensurate magnetic orderings when ${\\bf k}_0$ is close to ${\\bf g}/n$, where ${\\bf g}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector and $n$ is integer.

This challenge is particularly severe in calibrating fault-tolerant, error-corrected circuits, where logical error probabilities are suppressed to higher order relative to physical noise and are therefore difficult to calibrate through direct logical measurements. Recently, Wagner et al. [PRL 130, 200601 (2023)] showed that, for phenomenological Pauli noise models, the logical channel can instead be inferred from syndrome measurement data generated during error correction. Here, we extend this framework to realistic circuit-level noise models. From a unified code-theoretic perspective and spacetime code formalism, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the logical channel from syndrome data alone and explicitly characterize the learnable degrees of freedom of circuit-level Pauli faults. Using Fourier analysis and compressed sensing, we develop efficient estimators with provable guarantees on sample complexity and computational cost. We further present an end-to-end protocol and demonstrate its performance on several syndrome-extraction circuits, achieving orders-of-magnitude sample-complexity savings over direct logical benchmarking.

However, real-world data validation consistently reveals significant predictive failures, such as peak underestimations of up to 50%. This research identifies a persistent fundamental methodological error: the calibration of prevalence-based (stock) models using raw daily incidence (flow) data without proper transformation. We propose an integrated protocol utilizing an exponentially weighted convolution to reconstruct active cases from reported incidence: $I(t) \\approx \\frac{1}{p} \\int_{0}^{t} NDC(\u03c4) e^{-\u03b3(t-\u03c4)} d\u03c4$. This transformation accounts for the recovery rate $\u03b3$ and the ascertainment rate $p$. We demonstrate that increasing structural complexity, such as adding latency (SEIR) or waning immunity (SIRS), fails to resolve the incidence-prevalence gap. Simulation results show that without the proposed universal pre-processor, these advanced models inherit the systematic biases of misaligned data types, leading to significant errors in estimating latent periods and the \"heavy tail\" of endemicity. The proposed convolution transformation must serve as a universal prerequisite for any compartmental framework, bridging the gap between clinical reporting and mechanistic modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SIR\u3001SEIR\u3001SIRS\uff09\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u65e5\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u60a3\u75c5\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u5377\u79ef\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u91cd\u6784\u6d3b\u8dc3\u75c5\u4f8b\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u9519\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4f4e\u4f30\u75ab\u60c5\u5cf0\u503c\u8fbe50%\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e00\u666e\u904d\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6307\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u5377\u79ef\u516c\u5f0f\uff1a$I(t) \\approx \\frac{1}{p} \\int_{0}^{t} NDC(\u03c4) e^{-\u03b3(t-\u03c4)} d\u03c4$\uff0c\u5c06\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u65b0\u589e\u75c5\u4f8b\uff08\u6d41\u91cf\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6d3b\u8dc3\u75c5\u4f8b\u6570\uff08\u5b58\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7ecf\u5178 compartmental \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SEIR\u3001SIRS\uff09\u4ecd\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6f5c\u4f0f\u671f\u548c\u75ab\u60c5\u5c3e\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u800c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u540e\uff0c\u5404\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5377\u79ef\u53d8\u6362\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e compartmental \u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u524d\u7f6e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

It admits an energy-dissipation law and, under suitable assumptions, bounded solutions. Many structure-preserving numerical schemes have been proposed to retain such properties; however, existing approaches are often fully implicit and therefore computationally expensive. We introduce a simple design principle for constructing dissipation-preserving finite difference schemes and apply it to the Swift--Hohenberg equation in three spatial dimensions. Our analysis relies on discrete inequalities for the underlying energy, assuming a Lipschitz continuous gradient and either convexity or $\u03bc$-strong convexity of the relevant terms. The resulting method is linearly implicit, yet it preserves the original energy-dissipation law, guarantees unique solvability, ensures boundedness of numerical solutions, and admits an a priori error estimate, provided that the time step is sufficiently small.

One important area of application is leukaemia research, where leukaemia cells are genetically modified in preclinical studies to explore new therapeutic targets for reducing leukaemic burden. In advanced experiments, these studies are often conducted in mice and generate time-resolved data, the analysis of which may reveal growth-inhibiting effects of the investigated gene modifications. However, the experimental data is often times evaluated using statistical tests which compare measurements from only two different time points. This approach does not only reduce the time series to two instances but also neglects biological knowledge about cell mechanisms. Such knowledge, translated into mathematical models, expands the power to investigate and understand effects of modifications on underlying mechanisms based on experimental data. We utilise two population growth models -- an exponential and a logistic growth model -- to capture cell dynamics over the whole experimental time horizon and to consider all measurement times jointly. This approach enables us to derive modification effects from estimated model parameters. We demonstrate that the exponential growth model recognises simulated scenarios more reliably than the other candidate model and than a statistical test. Moreover, we apply the population growth models to evaluate the efficacy of candidate gene knockouts in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acute leukaemia.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6307\u6570\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6025\u6027\u767d\u8840\u75c5PDX\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u57fa\u56e0\u6572\u9664\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec6\u80de\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5168\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u57fa\u56e0\u4fee\u9970\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u589e\u957f\u4e24\u79cd\u7fa4\u4f53\u751f\u957f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u57fa\u56e0\u4fee\u9970\u5bf9\u7ec6\u80de\u751f\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645PDX\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u957f\u6291\u5236\u6548\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645PDX\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u57fa\u56e0\u6572\u9664\u7684\u7597\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u66f4\u5177\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u56e0\u4fee\u9970\u5bf9\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u7ec6\u80de\u751f\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We approximate the process through a piecewise function defined by a sum of sinusoidal functions with unknown frequencies and amplitudes plus noise. The inference for this model is non-trivial. However, discretising the parameter space allows us to recast this complex estimation problem into a more tractable linear model, where the covariates are Fourier basis functions. Then, any change-point detection algorithms for segmentation can be used. The advantage of our proposal is that it bypasses the need for trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms used by state-of-the-art methods.

Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \\textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \\textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes. Our work thus substantially extends the scope of quantum product codes and provides a versatile framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum memories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u4e3e\u79ef\uff08QBP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u201c\u81ea\u4e3e\u65b9\u7a0b\u201d\u6765\u6784\u9020\u91cf\u5b50CSS\u7801\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8d85\u56fe\u79ef\u7801\u548c\u5206\u5f62\u5b50\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u201c\u53c9\u590d\u5f62\u201d\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5f62\u5b50\u7801\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u672c\u8d28\u3002QBP\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edfHGP\u7801\u7684\u7801\u7387\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u8c03\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u79ef\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u5f62\u5b50\u7801\u7b49\u65b0\u578b\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u66f4\u4f18\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u540c\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u79ef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u4e3e\u79ef\uff08QBP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u81ea\u4e3e\u65b9\u7a0b\u201d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u6784\u9020\u94fe\u590d\u5f62\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u2014\u2014\u53c9\u590d\u5f62\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0QBP\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\u94fe\u7fa4\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "QBP\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8d85\u56fe\u79ef\u7801\u548cX-cube\u7b49\u5206\u5f62\u5b50\u7801\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5f62\u5b50\u7801\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5c42\u5316\u5206\u5f62\u5e8f\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7801\u53ef\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7a81\u7834HGP\u7801\u7684\u7801\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "QBP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u6784\u9020\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u79ef\u7801\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To do it, we first linearize the nonlinear equation around the steady state. The linearized system turns out to be a system coupled between second order and fourth order parabolic equations and the control acts in the fourth order parabolic equation. The null controllability of the linearized system is obtained by a duality argument proving an observability inequality. To prove the observability inequality, a new Carleman inequality for the coupled system is derived. Next, using the source term method, it is shown that the null controllability of the linearized system with non-homogeneous terms persists provided the non-homogeneous terms satisfy certain estimates in a suitable weighted space.

The magnon dispersion in a ferromagnet usually possesses an effective time reversal symmetry in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, preventing the appearance of topological magnons. When a spin system is coupled to itinerant electrons, we find that the magnon band structure of the spin system experiences time-reversal symmetry breaking with the electron-magnon interaction via the exchange coupling, where topological magnons arise without requiring strong DM.

For a generic stable discretization of $X$ in terms of a dense sequence $(V_m)_{m \\in \\mathbb{N}_0}$ of finite-dimensional subspaces, we obtain fully-discrete, linear approximations in terms of so-called sparse-grid tensor-product projectors, with convergence rates of approximations as well as of sparse-grid tensor-product quadratures of the target functions.\n  We verify the abstract assumptions in two fundamental application settings: first, a linear elliptic diffusion equation with affine-parametric coefficients and second, abstract holomorphic maps between separable Hilbert spaces with affine-parametric input data encoding. For these settings, as in [37,20], cancellation of anti-symmetric terms in ultra-spherical Jacobi generalized polynomial chaos expansion coefficients implies crucially improved convergence rates of sparse-grid tensor-product quadrature with respect to the infinite-tensor-product Jacobi weight, free from the ``curse-of-dimension\".\n  Largely self-contained proofs of all results are developed.

This study aims to conduct a comparison of power and type 1 error rates of BDB (using meta-analytic predictive prior (MAP)) and SCM using a case study of Pediatric Atopic Dermatitis. Six historical randomised control trials were selected for use in both the creation of the MAP prior and synthetic control arm. The R library RBesT was used to create a MAP prior and the R library Synthpop was used to create a synthetic control arm for the SCM. Power and type 1 error rate were used as comparison metrics. BDB produced a power of 0.580 and a type 1 error rate of 0.026. SCM produced a power of 0.641 and a type 1 error rate of 0.027. In this case study, the SCM model produced a higher power than the BDB method with a similar type 1 error rate.

We introduce \\textsc{Manjushri}, a new automated framework for scalable quantum-circuit equivalence checking. \\textsc{Manjushri} uses local projections as discriminative circuit fingerprints, implemented with weighted binary decision diagrams (WBDDs), yielding a compact and efficient symbolic representation of quantum behavior. We present an extensive experimental evaluation that, for random 1D Clifford+$T$ circuits, explores the trade-off between \\textsc{Manjushri} and \\textsc{ECMC}, a tool for equivalence checking based on a much different approach. \\textsc{Manjushri} is much faster up to depth 30 (with the crossover point varying from 39--49, depending on the number of qubits and whether the input circuits are equivalent or inequivalent): when inputs are equivalent, \\textsc{Manjushri} is about 10$\\times$ faster (or more); when inputs are inequivalent, \\textsc{Manjushri} is about 8$\\times$ faster (or more). For both kinds of equivalence-checking outcomes, \\textsc{ECMC}'s success rate out to depth 50 is impressive on 32- and 64-qubit circuits: on such circuits, \\textsc{ECMC} is almost uniformly successful. However, \\textsc{ECMC} struggled on 128-qubit circuits for some depths. \\textsc{Manjushri} is almost uniformly successful out to about depth 38, before tailing off to about 75\\% at depth 50 (falling to 0\\% at depth 48 for 128-qubit circuits that are equivalent).

Within this framework, the emergence of the t-GGE is fully accounted for by the quasiparticle picture, and we argue that this description remains valid whenever the Lindbladian admits an appropriate coarse-grained representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8017\u6563\u81ea\u7531\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5f31\u8017\u6563\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u53ef\u7531\u666e\u9002\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e7f\u4e49\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u7cfb\u7efc\uff08t-GGE\uff09\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u6001\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u666e\u9002\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8017\u6563\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7ea0\u7f20\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u8017\u6563\u4e0b\u7684\u6dec\u706b\u540e\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u5f39\u9053\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5f31\u8017\u6563\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ea0\u7f20\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u7cfb\u7efc\uff08t-GGE\uff09\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff1b\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91cat-GGE\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u6797\u5fb7\u5e03\u62c9\u5fb7\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u8868\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u56fe\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684t-GGE\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ecd\u7136\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u8017\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

It is a phase-field model that combines the Cahn-Hilliard regularized interface equation and Biot's equations of poroelasticity. Solving the system poses significant challenges due to its coupled, nonlinear, and non-convex nature. The main goal of this work is to provide a consistent and efficient solution strategy. With this in mind, we introduce a semi-implicit time discretization such that the resulting discrete system is equivalent to a convex minimization problem. Then, using abstract theory for convex problems, we prove the convergence of an alternating minimization method to the time-discrete system. The solution strategy is relatively flexible in terms of spatial discretization, although we require standard inverse inequalities for the guaranteed convergence of the alternating minimization method. Finally, we perform some numerical experiments that show the promise of the proposed solution strategy, both in terms of efficiency and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9Cahn-Hilliard-Biot\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u5b54\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u534a\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51f8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eCahn-Hilliard-Biot\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u79bb\u6563\u540e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u51f8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6807\u51c6\u9006\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u4e3aCahn-Hilliard-Biot\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

If so, the filtering distribution cannot be estimated and the estimated parameter likelihood is zero. The alive particle filter addresses this by simulating a random number of particles for each inter-observation interval, stopping after a target number of non-zero conditional likelihoods. For outlying observations or poor parameter values, a non-zero result can be extremely unlikely, and computational costs prohibitive. We introduce the Frankenfilter, a principled, partially alive particle filter that targets a user-defined amount of success whilst fixing lower and upper bounds on the number of simulations. The Frankenfilter produces unbiased estimators of the likelihood, suitable for pseudo-marginal Metropolis--Hastings (PMMH).

While individual particles follow stochastic trajectories, the probability law evolves deterministically in the mean-field limit, potentially limiting exploration in multimodal landscapes. We introduce two principled approaches to inject noise directly into the probability law dynamics: a perturbative method based on conditional MKV theory, and a geometric approach leveraging tangent space structure. While these approaches are of independent interest, the aim of this work is to apply them to global optimization. Our framework applies generically to any method that can be formulated as a MKV system. Extensive experiments on multimodal objective functions demonstrate that both our noise injection strategies enhance consistently the exploration and convergence across different configurations of dynamics, such as Langevin, Consensus-Based Optimization, and Stein Boltzmann Sampling, providing a versatile toolkit for global optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5411McKean-Vlasov\uff08MKV\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f4\u63a5\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u591a\u5cf0\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5747\u573a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u6982\u7387\u6f14\u5316\u5177\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6MKV\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5fae\u6270\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eLangevin\u3001Consensus-Based Optimization\u548cStein Boltzmann Sampling\u7b49\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eMKV\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In the isotropic case ($\u0394=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $\u0394$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $\u0394$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries.

We show that, for a general quantum channel, it is QMA-hard to compute its quantum capacity, and that the maximal-entanglement-assisted zero-error one-shot classical capacity is uncomputable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5bb9\u91cf\u662fQMA\u96be\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6700\u5927\u7ea0\u7f20\u8f85\u52a9\u96f6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u7ecf\u5178\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u533a\u5206\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff1a\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u6216\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\uff1f\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u6709\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u542f\u52a8\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u822c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5bb9\u91cf\u662fQMA\u96be\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u6700\u5927\u7ea0\u7f20\u8f85\u52a9\u96f6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u7ecf\u5178\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5bb9\u91cf\u662fQMA\u96be\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u7ea0\u7f20\u8f85\u52a9\u96f6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u7ecf\u5178\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5bb9\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6781\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Using resonant X-ray diffraction, we clearly observed the disappearance of magnetic satellite peaks, corresponding to the transition from the conical to the field-induced ferromagnetic state. The critical fields were determined to be 4 T for $x=0$ and 7 T for $x= 0.05$, which were hardly discernible in the magnetization curves. We also found that atomic displacements with the same propagation vector emerge simultaneously with the onset of the conical order. The transition temperature $T_{\\text{N}}$ and the critical fields for $H \\parallel c$ ($H_{\\text{c}}^{z}$) and $H\\perp c$ ($H_{\\text{c}}^{x}$) are discussed on the basis of a mean-field calculation for a simple $q=1$ model of the magnetic structure.

In this paper we examine techniques to accelerate the application of DMD to large-scale data sets with an eye on randomized techniques. Randomized techniques exploit low-rank matrix approximations at a much smaller computational cost, therefore permitting the use of increased data set sizes. In particular, we propose the application of the RPCholesky algorithm in the setting of kernelized DMD (KDMD).

To mitigate the slow convergence of standard Monte Carlo sampling, FNWoS is then proposed via integrating this simplified FWoS estimator, derived from the Feynman-Kac representation, with a neural network surrogate. By amortizing sampling effort over the entire domain during training, FNWoS achieves more accurate evaluation at arbitrary query points with dramatically fewer trajectories than classical FWoS. To further enhance efficiency in regimes where the fractional order $\u03b1$ is close to 2 and trajectories become excessively long, we introduce a truncated path strategy with a prescribed maximum step count.

Many approaches train on local signals from lookahead heuristics such as strong branching, and linear programming (LP) bound improvement for cut selection. Training and evaluation of the learned models often focus on local score accuracy. We show that such local score-based methods can lead to search trees exponentially larger than optimal tree sizes, by identifying two sources of this gap. The first is that these widely used expert signals can be misaligned with overall tree size. LP bound improvement can select a root cut set that yields an exponentially larger strong branching tree than selecting cuts by a simple proxy score, and strong branching itself can be exponentially suboptimal (Dey et al., 2024). The second is that small discrepancies can be amplified by the branch-and-bound recursion. An arbitrarily small perturbation of the right-hand sides in a root cut set can change the minimum tree size from a single node to exponentially many. For branching, arbitrarily small score discrepancies, and differences only in tie-breaking, can produce trees of exponentially different sizes, and even a small number of decision differences along a trajectory can incur exponential growth. These results show that branch-and-cut policies trained and learned using local expert scores do not guarantee small trees, thus motivating the study of data-driven methods that produce policies better aligned with tree size rather than only accuracy on expert scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

QEM strategies based on agnostic noise amplification (ANA) are intrinsically resilient to such noise variations, but their sampling cost remains a major practical bottleneck.

To accomplish this, scrambling dynamics are leveraged to map distinct signals to unique patterns of bitstring measurements, which distinguishes a large number of signals without significant sensitivity loss. Based on this principle, we develop a computationally efficient protocol utilizing random global Clifford unitaries and evaluate its performance both analytically and numerically. Our protocol naturally extends to scrambling dynamics generated by random local Clifford circuits, local random unitary circuits (RUCs), and ergodic Hamiltonian evolution--commonly realized in near-term quantum hardware--and opens the door to applications ranging from precise noise benchmarking of quantum dynamics to learning time-dependent Hamiltonians.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
