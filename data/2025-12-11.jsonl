To appear at the 32nd IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2026)", "summary": "Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key challenge is the design of decoders for real-time quantum error correction (QEC), which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle common, sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources present in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below a useful level in practical scenarios. Furthermore, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization.\n  To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22 nm FDSOI technology, we achieve a peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 4 K power budget of 1.5 W, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21."}

At the same time, decarbonization policies are being considered, adding uncertainty about future generation portfolios and system costs. This study evaluates how population driven load growth and proposed decarbonization regulations may affect ERCOT in 2030 using a capacity expansion model. Three population scenarios are analyzed: baseline, lower growth, and higher growth. For each scenario, additional cases introduce a CO2 emissions limit and a carbon price to assess their effects on system costs, generation mix, and non served energy.\n  Results show that population growth increases total system costs and unmet demand, while storage needs and transmission transfer levels remain relatively stable. A CO2 emissions limit has almost no effect because ERCOT is already expected to meet the 2030 threshold. In contrast, carbon pricing produces a meaningful shift toward renewable generation and reduced use of natural gas, although cost impacts vary by scenario. These findings show the importance of accounting for demographic uncertainty in long term planning and suggest that carbon pricing may be a more effective decarbonization mechanism than static emissions limits. The study also provides a basis for future stochastic modeling that incorporates uncertainty in demand, renewable output, and fuel prices."}

To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes non-uniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control $n$ satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system."}

We find that the long-lived resonances follow TCOE statistics, reproducing the density of states and level spacing correlations, but depart from Ginibre predictions. Short-lived resonances, however, do not show a clear correspondence with either random-matrix ensemble. We also demonstrate that increasing the leak size takes the density of states of the TCOE toward the Ginibre limit, yet their spectral correlations remain distinct."}

Recent advances in additive manufacturing facilitate the physical realization of multi-material excipients, offering superior customization of target release profiles. However, polypill formulations remain tuned by ad hoc parameter sweeps; this reliance renders current design workflows ill-suited for the systematic exploration of the high-dimensional space of shapes, compositions, and release behaviors.\n  We present an automated design framework for polypills that leverages topology optimization to match dissolution behaviors with prescribed drug release kinetics. In particular, we employ a supershape parametrization to define geometry/phase distribution, a neural network representation to specify excipient distribution, and a coupled system of modified Allen-Cahn and Fick's diffusion equations to govern dissolution kinetics.

The current approach represents each snapshot with time-varying bases consisting of two-dimensional in-plane modes and one-dimensional spanwise modes, together with a reduced covariance matrix. We derive closed-form evolution equations for these time-varying components and advance them over time, requiring only a small rolling window and avoiding full-history storage. Applied to extreme vortex gust-airfoil interaction at Re=5000, we examine how in-plane modes and their associated energy level evolve across gust conditions of varying intensity and size. Before impingement, the first in-plane mode dominates; after impingement, the second mode gains energy_amplified by stronger/larger gusts. A larger leading-mode energy gap implies coherent structure and faster recovery; a smaller gap with slower decay indicates richer multiscale activity and delayed re-stabilization. These trends follow the transient lift dynamics as well, with higher amplitude and more oscillations indicated by a rise in the leading singular values. This work provides an interpretable, time-varying data-driven modal analysis of extreme gust encounter."}

Let $Q$ denote the distribution of $Y$. We introduce a hierarchy of denoisers $T_0, T_1, \\ldots, T_\\infty : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that are agnostic to the signal distribution $P$, depending only on higher-order score functions of $Q$. Each denoiser $T_K$ is progressively refined using the $(2K-1)$-th order score function of $Q$ at noise resolution $σ^{2K}$, achieving better denoising quality measured by the Wasserstein metric $W(T_K \\sharp Q, P)$. The limiting denoiser $T_\\infty$ identifies the optimal transport map with $T_\\infty \\sharp Q = P$.\n  We provide a complete characterization of the combinatorial structure underlying this hierarchy through Bell polynomial recursions, revealing how higher-order score functions encode the optimal transport map for signal denoising. We study two estimation strategies with convergence rates for higher-order scores from i.i.d. samples drawn from $Q$: (i) plug-in estimation via Gaussian kernel smoothing, and (ii) direct estimation via higher-order score matching. This hierarchy of agnostic denoisers opens new perspectives in signal denoising and empirical Bayes."}

While the scattering rate is only moderately anisotropic at zero strain, we find that it becomes strongly anisotropic at the Lifshitz point. At the lowest energies, we recover the expected universal behavior: the scattering rate varies (ignoring logarithmic corrections) as $τ^{-1}\\sim ω$ at the Van Hove point and as $τ^{-1}\\sim ω^{3/2}$ away from it. At higher energies, however, corrections of order $ω^2$ become important in both regimes. We show that the experimentally observed behavior $τ^{-1} \\sim ω^α$ with $α\\approx 1.4(2)$ at the Van Hove point can be quantitatively explained by a superposition of linear and quadratic contributions to the scattering rate, which are comparable in magnitude at the intermediate energies probed by experiment, rather than in terms of a new universal power law. We further predict a distinctive anisotropy, strain dependence, and a non-monotonic frequency dependence of the scattering rate at a Lifshitz transition, all of which may be directly tested in experiments."}

While previous studies explored FHN networks subjected to homogeneous noise, revealing behaviors such as noise-induced synchronization, stochastic resonance, and coherence resonance, the impact of noise heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Moreover, the emergence of EE under heterogeneous stochastic excitation has largely been overlooked. To address these gaps, we capture the natural variability in neuronal responses to external stimuli by introducing nonidentical noise sources, thereby reflecting diversity across the network. Our results reveal that EE can arise both globally, where large excursions occur collectively across the entire network, and partially, where only a subset of oscillators exhibits extreme activity depending on the interplay between noise intensity and coupling strength. We further identify three distinct classes of EE that enrich the system's dynamical repertoire and propose a quantitative metric capable of distinguishing between global and local occurrences. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even under heterogeneous noise inputs, noise can synchronize EE across the network, underscoring the robustness of collective dynamics in stochastic regimes. Furthermore, causal interaction analysis between oscillator pairs provides mechanistic insights into the initiation and propagation of EE. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of both partially and globally synchronized EE triggered solely by noise in a network of coupled oscillators. These findings enhance our understanding of noise-driven collective behavior in complex systems and provide new insights into neuronal dynamics under random influences."}

Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences."}

A core contribution is a description of the mathematical changes to the covariance expressions which allow these benefits to be realised. The gradient and anti-derivatives are obtained to facilitate learning of the kernel hyperparameters. Numerical stability issues are also discussed. To illustrate its application, an IntegralGP data fusion algorithm is described. The objective is to assimilate line-based blasthole assays and update a block model that provides long-range prediction of Fe concentration beneath the drilled bench. Heteroscedastic GP is used to fuse chemically compatible but spatially incongruous data with different resolutions and sample spacings. Domain knowledge embodied in the structure and empirical distribution of the block model must be generally preserved while local inaccuracies are corrected. Using validation measurements within the predicted bench, our experiments demonstrate an improvement in bench-below grade prediction performance.

Here we study the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to multiple cavity modes via inter-cell hopping terms, focusing on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the MCD. We show that, whenever the frequency is larger than the static hopping amplitudes, the coupling induces a discontinuous jump in the MCD, already at small times, signaling that such a coupling also leaves a signature in the survival edge probability when the dynamics are initialized at one of the two edges. For frequencies comparable to the static hopping amplitudes, topological order competes with dissipative effects, which makes the MCD behave smoothly, retaining information about the driven-dissipative topology."}

Numerical violations of this domain can lead to loss of hyperbolicity, resulting in illposedness and severe numerical instabilities. It is therefore crucial for numerical schemes to preserve the invariant domain to ensure both physically meaningful solutions and robust computations. For complex systems, constructing invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) schemes is highly nontrivial and particularly challenging for high-order accurate methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IDP schemes for hyperbolic and related systems, with a focus on the most popular approaches for constructing provable IDP schemes. We first give a systematic review of the fundamental approaches for establishing the IDP property in first-order accurate schemes, covering finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and residual distribution methods. Then we focus on two widely used and actively developed classes of high order IDP schemes as well as their recent developments, most of which have emerged in the past decade. The first class of methods seeks an intrinsic weak IDP property in high-order schemes and then designs polynomial limiters to enforce a strong IDP property at the points of interest. This generic approach applies to high-order finite volume and discontinuousGalerkin schemes. The second class is based on the flux limiting approaches, which originated from the flux-corrected transport method and can be adapted to a broader range of spatial discretizations, including finite difference and continuous finite element methods. In this survey, we elucidate the main ideas in the construction of IDP schemes, provide some new perspectives and insights, with extensive examples, and numerical experiments in gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics."}

Finally, possible directions on how to enhance the SC transition temperature and stabilize the SC phase are also discussed."}

Plus 140, 1133 (2025)", "summary": "Many natural and physical processes can be understood by analyzing multiple system variables evolving, forming a multivariate time series. Predicting such time series is challenging due to the inherent noise and interdependencies among variables. Echo state networks (ESNs), a class of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, offer an efficient alternative to conventional recurrent neural networks by training only the output weights while keeping the reservoir dynamics fixed, reducing computational complexity. We propose a clustered ESNs (CESNs) that enhances the ability to model and predict multivariate time series by organizing the reservoir nodes into clusters, each corresponding to a distinct input variable. Input signals are directly mapped to their associated clusters, and intra-cluster connections remain dense while inter-cluster connections are sparse, mimicking the modular architecture of biological neural networks. This architecture improves information processing by limiting cross-variable interference and enhances computational efficiency through independent cluster-wise training via ridge regression. We further explore different reservoir topologies, including ring, Erdős-Rényi (ER), and scale-free (SF) networks, to evaluate their impact predictive performance. Our algorithm works well across diverse real-world datasets such as the stock market, solar wind, and chaotic Rössler system, demonstrating that CESNs consistently outperform conventional ESNs in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness to noise, particularly when using ER and SF topologies. These findings highlight the adaptability of CESNs for complex, multivariate time series forecasting."}

The overall maneuver requires coordination between two separately actuated modules of the servicer satellite: (1) a moment generation module and (2) a manipulation module. We apply MPC to control both modules by explicitly modeling the cross-coupling dynamics between them. We demonstrate that the MPC controller can enforce actuation and state constraints that prior control approaches could not account for. We evaluate the performance of the MPC controller by simulating zero-impulse contact scenarios with a free-spinning target satellite via numerical Monte Carlo (MC) trials and comparing the simulation results with prior control approaches. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the MPC controller in maintaining spin synchronization and zero-impulse contact under operation constraints, moving contact location, and observation and actuation noise."}

In the thermodynamic limit, the model exhibits a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition between the unsynchronized and synchronized states. We show that this transition is not governed by any extremum dissipation principle -- depending on system parameters, synchronization may either reduce or enhance the dissipation. Close to the phase transition, we observe a divergent behavior of fluctuations and responses with $N$ and characterize their universal scaling behavior. In particular, the covariances of the oscillator phases and the local entropy productions are shown to diverge towards $-\\infty$, a phenomenon that has not been reported before. Finally, we study the behavior of information-theoretic quantities, demonstrating that mutual information and information flow between oscillators display different scaling with $N$ in synchronized and unsynchronized states, and thus can act as order parameters of synchronization."}

However, existing financial benchmarks primarily focus on textbook-style question answering and numerical problem solving, but fail to evaluate models' real-world safety behaviors. They weakly assess regulatory compliance and investor-protection norms, rarely stress-test multi-turn adversarial tactics such as jailbreaks or prompt injection, inconsistently ground answers in long filings, ignore tool- or RAG-induced over-reach risks, and rely on opaque or non-auditable evaluation protocols. To close these gaps, we introduce CNFinBench, a benchmark that employs finance-tailored red-team dialogues and is structured around a Capability-Compliance-Safety triad, including evidence-grounded reasoning over long reports and jurisdiction-aware rule/tax compliance tasks. For systematic safety quantification, we introduce the Harmful Instruction Compliance Score (HICS) to measure how consistently models resist harmful prompts across multi-turn adversarial dialogues. To ensure auditability, CNFinBench enforces strict output formats with dynamic option perturbation for objective tasks and employs a hybrid LLM-ensemble plus human-calibrated judge for open-ended evaluations. Experiments on 21 models across 15 subtasks confirm a persistent capability-compliance gap: models achieve an average score of 61.0 on capability tasks but fall to 34.18 on compliance and risk-control evaluations. Under multi-turn adversarial dialogue tests, most systems reach only partial resistance (HICS 60-79), demonstrating that refusal alone is not a reliable proxy for safety without cited and verifiable reasoning."}

The VP model is widely used in climate simulations to represent large-scale sea-ice dynamics. However, the strong nonlinearity introduced by the material law makes VP solvers computationally expensive, with the cost per degree of freedom increasing rapidly under mesh refinement. High spatial resolution is particularly required to capture narrow deformation bands known as linear kinematic features in viscous-plastic models. To improve computational efficiency in simulating such fine-scale deformation features, we propose to enrich coarse-mesh finite element approximations with fine-scale corrections predicted by neural networks trained with high-resolution simulations. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements, which is efficient due to its relatively small size and parallel applicability across grid patches. An advantage of this local approach is that it generalizes well to different right-hand sides and computational domains, since the network operates on small subregions rather than learning details tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions, forcing, or geometry. The numerical examples quantify the runtime and evaluate the error for this hybrid approach with respect to the simulation of sea-ice deformations. Applying the learned network correction enables coarser-grid simulations to achieve qualitatively similar accuracy at approximately 11 times lower computational cost relative to the high-resolution reference simulations. Moreover, the learned correction accelerates the Newton solver by up to 10% compared to runs without the correction at the same mesh resolution."}

This note gives a short and intuitive geometric proof of the same characterisation, based on a supporting hyperplane argument applied to concave envelopes. We also show that the result holds even without imposing monotonicity in the definition of e-merging functions, which was needed for the existing proof. This shows that any non-monotone merging rule is automatically dominated by a monotone one, and hence extending the definition beyond the monotone case brings no additional generality."}

Using the density matrix renormalization group, we identify two distinct field-induced transitions. The first is a continuous transition into an intermediate phase, where the symmetry responsible for the two-fold ground-state degeneracy is broken. The second is a first-order transition into the high-field phase, characterized by a discontinuous jump in the spin-spin correlator. Entanglement-entropy scaling confirms that the first transition belongs to the Ising critical point with the central charge $1/2$.

In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures."}

We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences."}

This approach exploits the curvature information of a low-fidelity objective function to converge within a basin of a local minimum of the high-fidelity model where low-fidelity curvature information is no longer valuable. The method then switches to a variance-reduced stochastic gradient descent procedure. We provide convergence guarantees in expectation under certain regularity assumptions and ensure the best-case $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization.

Numerical experiments, including three-dimensional problems based on community benchmarks for incompressible Darcy flow in fractured porous media, demonstrate reliable performance of the estimators for the non-matching grids and effectivity that is comparable to the estimators for matching grids."}

Here we present FuXi-Nowcast, a deep-learning system that jointly predicts composite radar reflectivity, surface precipitation, near-surface temperature, wind speed and wind gusts at 1-km resolution over eastern China. FuXi-Nowcast integrates multi-source observations, such as radar, surface stations and the High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS), with three-dimensional atmospheric fields from the machine-learning weather model FuXi-2.0 within a multi-task Swin-Transformer architecture. A convective signal enhancement module and distribution-aware hybrid loss functions are designed to preserve intense convective structures and mitigate the rapid intensity decay common in deep-learning nowcasts. FuXi-Nowcast surpasses the operational CMA-MESO 3-km numerical model in Critical Success Index for reflectivity, precipitation and wind gusts across thresholds and lead times up to 12 h, with the largest gains for heavy rainfall. Case studies further show that FuXi-Nowcast more accurately captures the timing, location and structure of convective initiation and subsequent evolution of convection. These results demonstrate that coupling three-dimensional machine-learning forecasts with high-resolution observations can provide multi-hazard, long-lead nowcasts that outperforms current operational systems."}

We apply this framework to four representative equations: two real-valued PDEs (the second-order wave equation and the Euler--Bernoulli beam equation) and two complex-valued PDEs (the complex transport equation and the Schroedinger equation with zero potential). We compute and analyze the Frechet root kernels for all four PDEs and show that, for constant material parameters, the kernel exhibits a consistent structure across systems, while its instantaneous form propagates as a wave whose shape depends on the initial conditions. For the Schroedinger equation, we find an especially notable result: the integrand of the Frechet root kernel coincides with the Born rule of quantum mechanics, suggesting that the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction may arise naturally from a general sensitivity-analysis framework rather than from an independent postulate. Our results establish a unified approach to sensitivity analysis for real- and complex-valued PDEs, provide a new perspective on the origin of the Born rule."}

To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes non-uniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control $n$ satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system."}

In this study, we analyze real-world pedestrian behavior at a route split within a busy train station using high-resolution trajectory data collected over a three-year time frame. We disclose a striking tendency for individuals to follow the same path as the person directly in front of them, even in the absence of social ties and even when such a choice leads to a longer travel time. This tendency leads to bursty dynamics, where sequences of pedestrians make identical decisions in succession, leading to strong patterns in collective movement. We employ a stochastic model that includes route costs, randomness, and social imitation to accurately reproduce the observed behavior, highlighting that local imitation behavior is the dominant driver of collective routing choices. These findings highlight how brief, low-level interactions between strangers can scale up to influence large-scale pedestrian movement, with strong implications for crowd management, urban design, and the broader understanding of social behavior in public spaces."}

Sieve analysis is a statistical framework used to determine whether a vaccine selectively prevents acquisition of certain genotypes while allowing breakthrough of other genotypes that evade immune responses. Traditionally, these analyses are conducted with a single sequence available per individual acquiring the pathogen. However, modern sequencing technology can provide detailed characterization of intra-individual viral diversity by capturing up to hundreds of pathogen sequences per person. In this work, we introduce methodology that extends sieve analysis to account for intra-individual viral diversity. Our approach estimates vaccine efficacy against viral populations with varying true (unobservable) frequencies of vaccine-mismatched mutations. To account for differential resolution of information from differing sequence counts per person, we use competing risks Cox regression with modeled causes of failure and propose an empirical Bayes approach for the classification model. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach reduces bias, provides nominal confidence interval coverage, and improves statistical power compared to conventional methods. We apply our method to the HVTN 705 Imbokodo trial, which assessed the efficacy of a heterologous vaccine regimen in preventing HIV-1 acquisition."}

Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations."}

We modify the standard setup by allowing the target to spontaneously switch between two states, either active or inactive, and investigate the distribution of first hitting times accrued while the target is active. For this setup, we provide closed formulas for the distribution of the first hitting time. Additionally, we can introduce stochastic resetting to the underlying process and, utilizing our results, derive the formulas for the first time the active target is hit by the process under stochastic resetting. Interestingly, we show that resetting in this setup still leaves some memory; the system is no longer Markovian, which prevents a straightforward application of standard techniques. The analytical results are accompanied by computer simulations of Langevin dynamics."}

Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $π$-shifted (ISD-$π$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$π$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$π$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$π$ patches."}

Cyqlone unifies algorithms based on the sequential Riccati recursion, parallel Schur complement methods, and cyclic reduction methods, thereby minimizing the required number of floating-point operations, while allowing parallelization across a user-configurable number of processors. Given sufficient parallelism, the solver run time scales with the logarithm of the horizon length (in contrast to the linear scaling of sequential Riccati-based methods), enabling real-time solution of long-horizon problems. Beyond multithreading on multi-core processors, implementations of Cyqlone can also leverage vectorization using batched linear algebra routines. Such batched routines exploit data parallelism using single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations, and expose a higher degree of instruction-level parallelism than their non-batched counterparts. This enables them to significantly outperform BLAS and BLASFEO for the small matrices that arise in optimal control. Building on this high-performance linear solver, we develop CyQPALM, a parallel and optimal-control-specific variant of the QPALM quadratic programming solver. It combines the parallel and vectorized linear algebra operations from Cyqlone with a parallel line search and parallel factorization updates, resulting in order-of-magnitude speedups compared to the state-of-the-art HPIPM solver.

We refer to these events as Rogue Vertical Drafts (RVDs). They exceed five standard deviations of observed vertical velocities and appear as paired updraft-downdraft structures in varicose mode. Four-dimensional observations reveal that RVDs are intermittent, recurrent, and unpredictable. On average, they are expected to occur every sim 12 days during summer over Northern Norway, assuming a 1000 s interval. Different instruments may capture only portions of these events, for example, only upward or downward drafts when restricted to a single altitude range. Despite their rarity, their magnitudes and frequency suggest potential impacts on dust-sized matter escaping from planets, natural and anthropogenic space material, and MLT climate and processes. We propose that RVDs are a fundamental yet under-recognized feature of the MLT, underscoring the need for global observations to assess their prevalence and significance."}

Understanding the effects of such topology on dynamical processes is pivotal for advances in social and natural sciences. In this work we consider the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators on modular networks and propose a simple coarse-graining procedure where modules are replaced by effective single oscillators. The method is inspired by EEG measurements, where very large groups of neurons under each electrode are interpreted as single nodes in a correlation network. We expose the interplay between intra-module and inter-module coupling strengths in keeping the coarse-graining process meaningful and show that its accuracy depends on the degree of intra-module synchronization. We show that, when modules are well synchronized, the phase transition from asynchronous to synchronous motion in networks with 2 and 3 modules is very well described by their respective reduced systems, regardless of the network structure connecting the modules. Application of the method to real networks with small modularity coefficients, on the other hand, reveals that the approximation is not accurate, although it still allows for the computation of the critical coupling and the qualitative behavior of the order parameter if the inter-module coupling is large enough."}

In this context, we revisit the random-field XXZ spin-1/2 chain at zero temperature with ferromagnetic interactions, equivalent to interacting fermions or hard-core bosons in a random potential with attractive interactions. We argue that localization in this model can be characterized by chain-breaking events, which are probed by the extreme values of simple local observables, such as the on-site density or the local magnetization, that are readily accessible in both experiments and numerical simulations. Adopting a bosonic language, we study the disorder-induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition from superfluid (SF) to Bose glass (BG), and focus on the strong disorder regime where localization is driven by weak links. Based on high-precision density matrix renormalization group simulations, we numerically show that extreme local densities accurately capture the BKT transition, even for relatively short chains ranging from a few dozen to a hundred sites. We also discuss the SF-BG transition in the weak disorder regime, where finite-size effects pose greater challenges. Overall, our work seeks to establish a solid foundation for using extreme statistics of local observables, such as density, to probe delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains, both in the ground state and at high energy."}

Yet most centrality-based approaches rely on pairwise topology and are purely structural, neglecting the higher-order interactions and the coupling between structure and dynamics. Consequently, the practical effectiveness of existing approaches remains uncertain when applied to complex spreading processes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified framework, Initial Propagation Score (IPS), to directly embed propagation dynamics into influence assessment on higher-order networks. We analytically derive mechanism-aware influence measures by relating the early-stage dynamics and local topological characteristics to long-term outbreak sizes, and such explicit physical context endows IPS with robustness, transferability, and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple dynamics and more than 20 real-world hypergraphs show that IPS consistently outperforms other leading baseline centralities. Furthermore, IPS estimates node influence with only local neighborhood information, yielding computational efficiency and scalability to large-scale networks. This work underscores the necessity of considering dynamics for reliable identification of influential nodes and provides a concise principled basis for optimizing interventions in epidemiology, information diffusion, and collective intelligence."}

The inverse matrix $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$ is required for likelihood-based estimation and inference. However, for unbalanced crossed designs, $\\mathbf{V}$ is dense and the lack of a closed-form representation for $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$, until now, has made using likelihood-based methods computationally challenging and difficult to analyse mathematically. We use the Khatri--Rao product to represent $\\mathbf{V}$ and then to construct a modified covariance matrix whose inverse admits an exact spectral decomposition. Building on this construction, we obtain an elegant and simple approximation to $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$ for asymptotic unbalanced designs. For non-asymptotic settings, we derive an accurate and interpretable approximation under mildly unbalanced data and establish an exact inverse representation as a low-rank correction to this approximation, applicable to arbitrary degrees of unbalance.

IRTest initializes with an offline-trained surrogate prediction model and progressively reduces surrogate-to-real gap during testing through two complementary adaptation mechanisms: (i) online neural fine-tuning in data-rich regimes, and (ii) lightweight importance-sampling-based weighting correction in data-limited regimes. A Bayesian optimization strategy, equipped with bias-corrected acquisition functions, guides scenario generation to balance exploration and exploitation in complex testing spaces. Extensive experiments across varying levels of task complexity and system heterogeneity demonstrate that IRTest consistently improves failure-discovery efficiency, testing robustness, and cross-system generalizability. These results highlight the potential of IRTest as a practical solution for scalable, adaptive, and resilient testing of decision-making agents."}

These include the one- and two-point probability distributions of the velocity, the multiplicity functions of voids and shocks, and the velocity and density correlation functions together with their associated power spectra. We also show that the full hierarchy of $n$-point distributions factorizes into a sequence of two-point conditional probabilities. This class of initial conditions leads to self-similar evolution and produces probability distributions characterized by stretched-exponential tails, with tail exponents spanning the full range from unity to infinity. The associated characteristic length scale grows as a power law of time, with an exponent lying between zero and one half."}

The inverse matrix $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$ is required for likelihood-based estimation and inference. However, for unbalanced crossed designs, $\\mathbf{V}$ is dense and the lack of a closed-form representation for $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$, until now, has made using likelihood-based methods computationally challenging and difficult to analyse mathematically. We use the Khatri--Rao product to represent $\\mathbf{V}$ and then to construct a modified covariance matrix whose inverse admits an exact spectral decomposition. Building on this construction, we obtain an elegant and simple approximation to $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$ for asymptotic unbalanced designs. For non-asymptotic settings, we derive an accurate and interpretable approximation under mildly unbalanced data and establish an exact inverse representation as a low-rank correction to this approximation, applicable to arbitrary degrees of unbalance.

This paper offers an approach for a more reactive (i.e., feedback-based) guidance that is based on closed-form analytical expressions and thereby suitable for onboard, real-time execution. In addition, a risk measurement is formulated based upon the concept of Dynamic Maneuvering Cue (DMC) which measures the amount of turn a vehicle would need to take in its current state in order to put itself outside the threat region. This approach is then extended to handle multiple threat regions simultaneously (with minimal additional computational complexity). Finally, the DMC constraint is applied to a simple feedback controller as well as a model predictive controller (MPC). The MPC shows better performance but at the cost of having to solve an optimization problem online versus the meager computational burden associated with the simple controller. This approach, which is based on assuming the threats are adversarial, may be used as a conservative method for collision avoidance and deconfliction."}

Numerical violations of this domain can lead to loss of hyperbolicity, resulting in illposedness and severe numerical instabilities. It is therefore crucial for numerical schemes to preserve the invariant domain to ensure both physically meaningful solutions and robust computations. For complex systems, constructing invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) schemes is highly nontrivial and particularly challenging for high-order accurate methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IDP schemes for hyperbolic and related systems, with a focus on the most popular approaches for constructing provable IDP schemes. We first give a systematic review of the fundamental approaches for establishing the IDP property in first-order accurate schemes, covering finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and residual distribution methods. Then we focus on two widely used and actively developed classes of high order IDP schemes as well as their recent developments, most of which have emerged in the past decade. The first class of methods seeks an intrinsic weak IDP property in high-order schemes and then designs polynomial limiters to enforce a strong IDP property at the points of interest. This generic approach applies to high-order finite volume and discontinuousGalerkin schemes. The second class is based on the flux limiting approaches, which originated from the flux-corrected transport method and can be adapted to a broader range of spatial discretizations, including finite difference and continuous finite element methods. In this survey, we elucidate the main ideas in the construction of IDP schemes, provide some new perspectives and insights, with extensive examples, and numerical experiments in gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics."}

These internal waves, generated by tidal flow over submarine topography, can propagate for thousands of kilometres across ocean basins, and become unstable through wave-mean flow or wave-wave interactions. Satellite observations of internal tides have shown that part of their lunar semidiurnal (M2) altimetry signal loses phase coherence in equatorial regions, thus affecting how we interpret their dynamics and energy distribution (Buijsman et al. 2017). We investigate the interaction of a baroclinic M2 internal tide wavepacket with an equatorial zonal jet, possibly of any horizontal or vertical structure. The dynamics of the low modes are explored as well as the potential excitation of higher vertical modes and how these interactions can generate incoherences in the baroclinic tide signal.\n  We develop an idealized linear model using modal decomposition (Kelly et al. 2016), which is solved using Dedalus, to study the dynamics of a mode 1 M2 internal wavepacket on an equatorial beta plane. A zonal jet, with a uniform or a sheared vertical structure, is added at the equator to investigate potential wave-mean flow interaction. We find that a vertically uniform zonal jet affects the propagation of the mode 1 wavepacket. Depending on the strength of the jet, this can cause total reflection or strong distortion of the wavepacket. In contrast, a wavepacket entering a vertically sheared jet shows energy scattering into higher modes, which have lower phase and group speeds, shorter wavelengths, and are thus more susceptible to dissipation (and critical layers for non-uniform stratification). As the wavepacket exits the jet, reverse energy transfer occurs and the phase speed difference between the modes may explain part of the phase incoherence observed in altimetry data."}

We find that stability is always determined by a spectral outlier, but with pronounced differences to the corresponding eigenvector in different regimes. We show that, depending on model details, instability may originate in nodes of anomalously low or high degree, or may occur everywhere in the network at once. Importantly, the dependence on extremal degrees results in considerable finite-size effects with different scaling depending on the ensemble degree distribution. Our results have potentially useful applications in network monitoring to predict or prevent catastrophic failures, and we validate our analytical findings through applications to epidemic dynamics and gene regulatory systems."}

Since the advent of topological semimetals, where the dispersion is often tilted around the band crossing where the Dirac fermion can appear, tilt has emerged as a key handle that controls physical properties. We study how tilt affects the transport and spectral properties of tilted 2D Dirac fermions under scalar disorder. Although our spectral analyses always show conformity to appropriate Gaussian ensembles, suggestive of delocalization, the conductivity scaling $g(L)$ shows a surprising richness. For a single Dirac node, relevant for quantum Hall transitions and topological insulator surface states, we find $g(L)\\sim a_1\\log(L)$ with a tilt-dependent coefficient $a_1>0$. Interestingly, when the tilt and transport directions are aligned, $a_1$ and hence $g(L)$ shows a spike at the critical point between the type-I and type-II regimes of the Dirac node. For systems with two Dirac nodes with unbroken time-reversal symmetry, pertinent to quasi-2D Dirac materials, we find $g(L)\\sim L^{a_1}(\\log L)^{a_2}$. However, we find a surprising tension between tilt along and perpendicular to the transport directions. For the former, $a_1$ changes sign as a function of tilt, hinting at a tilt-driven localization-delocalization transition, while $a_1<0$ for all tilts in the latter case, implying localization. These localized behaviors also reveal tension with the delocalization seen in spectral properties and suggest differing localization tendencies in real and Hilbert spaces. Overall, our work identifies tilt as an essential control parameter that uncovers rich and unconventional transport physics in 2D Dirac materials."}

We propose estimators based on the weights obtained by an algorithm that directly penalizes weight dispersion while enforcing approximate covariate and mediator balance, thereby improving stability and mitigating bias in finite samples. We establish the convergence rates of the proposed weights and show that the resulting estimators are asymptotically normal and achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms not only the EIF-based estimator and the IPW estimator but also the regression imputation estimator in challenging scenarios with model misspecification.

The VP model is widely used in climate simulations to represent large-scale sea-ice dynamics. However, the strong nonlinearity introduced by the material law makes VP solvers computationally expensive, with the cost per degree of freedom increasing rapidly under mesh refinement. High spatial resolution is particularly required to capture narrow deformation bands known as linear kinematic features in viscous-plastic models. To improve computational efficiency in simulating such fine-scale deformation features, we propose to enrich coarse-mesh finite element approximations with fine-scale corrections predicted by neural networks trained with high-resolution simulations. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements, which is efficient due to its relatively small size and parallel applicability across grid patches. An advantage of this local approach is that it generalizes well to different right-hand sides and computational domains, since the network operates on small subregions rather than learning details tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions, forcing, or geometry. The numerical examples quantify the runtime and evaluate the error for this hybrid approach with respect to the simulation of sea-ice deformations. Applying the learned network correction enables coarser-grid simulations to achieve qualitatively similar accuracy at approximately 11 times lower computational cost relative to the high-resolution reference simulations. Moreover, the learned correction accelerates the Newton solver by up to 10% compared to runs without the correction at the same mesh resolution."}

The models span a range of frameworks, including box models, direct numerical simulation, and large-eddy simulation models, and incorporate both bin and Lagrangian microphysics. Each model was tuned to reproduce the observed liquid-phase steady state prior to ice injection. Ice particles were then introduced into the domain at various rates to examine cloud glaciation behavior. By the intercomparison design, all models successfully reproduced the observed mean droplet radius and number concentration during the liquid-phase stage. Increasing ice particle injection rates led to consistent qualitative trends across models: depletion of liquid water, reduced total water content, and a shift in particle size distributions toward larger radii. However, quantitative differences arose due to variations in model treatment in dynamics and microphysics, including subgrid-scale turbulence parameterizations, wall forcing, and particle removal parameterizations. Most models that simulate the full chamber retained liquid droplets near the lower boundary, where supersaturation forcing is strongest and droplets are replenished before mixing into the core region.

It requires an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and even then, for continuous symmetries, it only works if the spatial dimension is not too low, following the classic results of Coleman, Hohenberg, Mermin and Wagner. While usually discussed in the context of quantum and statistical field theories, and in particular, effective field theories, there are advantages in addressing the same kind of phenomena on discrete geometric structures rather than conventional manifolds. When the space is discretized into a lattice, a lucid picture of conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking springs up, with the ultraviolet issues of continuum quantum field theory out-of-sight, and the key effect, which is infrared in nature, revealed through elementary harmonic oscillator networks. From there, it is natural to generalize lattices to other graphs/networks. In this setting, the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is controlled by fractional generalizations of resistance distance and the Kirchhoff index, and most broadly by the spectral dimension. Predictably, because of richness of discrete geometric structures in comparison with continuous manifolds, a broader array of geometries emerge where spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is blocked by large fluctuations."}

Among them, Bell nonlocality is a central example. For bipartite Bell inequalities, nonlocal correlations obey strict monogamy: a violation of one inequality precludes violations of other inequalities on the overlapping subsystems. In the multipartite setting, however, Bell nonlocality becomes inherently polygamous. This was previously shown for subsystems obtained by removing a single particle from an $N$-partite system. Here, we generalize this result to arbitrary $(N-k)$-partite subsystems with $k>0$. We demonstrate that a single $N$-qubit state can violate all $\\binom{N}{k}$ relevant Bell inequalities simultaneously. We further construct an $N$-qubit Bell inequality, obtained by symmetrizing the $(N-k)$-qubit ones, that is maximally violated by states exhibiting this generalized polygamy. We compare these violations with those achievable by GHZ states and show that polygamy offers an advantage in multipartite scenarios, providing new insights into scalable certification of non-classicality in quantum devices. Our analysis relies on symmetry properties of the MABK inequalities. Finally, we show that this behavior can occur across multiple subsystem sizes, a phenomenon we call hyper-polygamy. These structures reveal the remarkable abundance of nonlocality present in multipartite quantum states and offer perspectives for their applications in quantum technologies."}

We assume relays or repeaters in groups or layers spatially separated. Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers."}

The framework is then extended to Filippov systems with discontinuous dynamics and to hybrid dynamical systems with state-dependent switching, yielding new necessary conditions for optimality in these settings.

Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations."}

While doubly robust estimators give a more robust way to estimate the causal effect from the observational study, they remain inconsistent if both models are misspecified. To improve the robustness, we develop a multiply robust estimator for the difference in cause-specific CIFs using right-censored competing risks data. The proposed framework integrates the pseudo-value approach, which transforms the censored, time-dependent CIF into a complete-data outcome, with the multiply robust estimation framework. By specifying multiple candidate models for both the propensity score and the outcome regression, the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically unbiased, provided that at least one of the multiple propensity score or outcome regression models is correctly specified. Simulation studies show our multiply robust estimator remains virtually unbiased and maintains nominal coverage rates under various model misspecification scenarios and a wide range of choices for the censoring rate. Finally, the proposed multiply robust model is illustrated using the Right Heart Catheterization dataset."}

When this source term is penalized based on the Fisher-Rao metric, the resulting model is referred to as the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) setting, and allows for the comparison between any two positive measures without the need for equalized total mass. In recent work, we introduced a constrained variant of this model, in which affine integral equality constraints are imposed along the measure path. In the present paper, we propose a further generalization of this framework, which allows for constraints that apply not just to the density path but also to the momentum and source terms, and incorporates affine inequalities in addition to equality constraints. We prove, under suitable assumptions on the constraints, the well-posedness of the resulting class of convex variational problems. The paper is then primarily devoted to developing an effective numerical pipeline that tackles the corresponding constrained optimization problem based on finite difference discretizations and parallel proximal schemes.

Existing testing approaches often rely on surrogate models of decision-making agents to generate large-scale scenario libraries; however, discrepancies between surrogate models and real decision-making agents significantly limit their generalizability and practical applicability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes intelligent resilience testing (IRTest), a unified online adaptive testing framework designed to rapidly adjust to diverse decision-making agents. IRTest initializes with an offline-trained surrogate prediction model and progressively reduces surrogate-to-real gap during testing through two complementary adaptation mechanisms: (i) online neural fine-tuning in data-rich regimes, and (ii) lightweight importance-sampling-based weighting correction in data-limited regimes. A Bayesian optimization strategy, equipped with bias-corrected acquisition functions, guides scenario generation to balance exploration and exploitation in complex testing spaces. Extensive experiments across varying levels of task complexity and system heterogeneity demonstrate that IRTest consistently improves failure-discovery efficiency, testing robustness, and cross-system generalizability. These results highlight the potential of IRTest as a practical solution for scalable, adaptive, and resilient testing of decision-making agents."}

While previous studies have separately examined non-Hermitian (NH) extensions of Kitaev chains and the effects of RSOC in Hermitian systems, the interplay between these two mechanisms remains largely unexplored. We analyze this interplay by considering two distinct types of complex on-site potentials: (i) a uniform gain/loss term and (ii) a complex quasiperiodic potential. We demonstrate that the impact of RSOC is highly model-dependent. In particular, RSOC does not affect the topological phase boundary in the Hermitian limit of the uniform gain/loss model (provided the spin-flip hopping is weaker than the pairing strength), but significantly alters the topological landscape in the NH regime. In contrast, for the quasiperiodic model, RSOC modifies the phase boundaries in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases. Notably, we find that the combined interplay of non-Hermiticity and RSOC drives topological transitions at significantly lower potential strengths compared to the Hermitian limit. We derive analytical expressions for the topological phase transitions in both cases and validate our predictions through numerical calculations of energy spectra and real-space winding numbers. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how non-Hermiticity and RSOC cooperatively reshape topological phase diagrams in one-dimensional superconducting systems."}

To address these issues, we propose a solution inspired by bagging and principal component decomposition. With our approach, the principal components of the auxiliary variables are constructed. Several samples of calibration variables are selected without replacement and with unequal probabilities from among the principal components. For each sample, a system of weights is obtained. The final weights are the average weights of these different weighting systems. With our proposed method, it is possible to calibrate exactly for some of the main auxiliary variables. For the other auxiliary variables, the weights cannot be calibrated exactly. The proposed method allows us to obtain a total estimator whose variance does not explode when new auxiliary variables are added and to obtain very low scatter weights.

We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences."}

Furthermore, by exploiting its low-rank structure and the spatial decay of correlations, we can obtain a compressed representation with computational complexity of order $\\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $N$ is the sample size. We further theoretically analyze the approximation error of the proposed compressed representation. We numerically demonstrate that the learned operator allows efficient prediction of future events and solving high-dimensional boundary value problems. This gives rise to a simple linear algebraic method for high-dimensional rare-events simulations."}

For our proposed time-discretized simulations, we provide two methods for selecting different time-step intervals to ensure that the error in distance approximation remains within specified bounds at all times. Through numerical examples we demonstrate that among control parameters that guarantee string stability some perform better than others under simultaneously occurring packet losses and sudden brakes."}

The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering.

On the other hand, multivariate asymptotic testing methods are valid for fixed dimension only and their implementations typically require the sample size to be large compared to the dimension to yield desirable results. In practical scenarios, it is usually not possible to determine whether the dimension of the data conform to the conditions required for the validity of the high-dimensional asymptotic methods for hypothesis testing, or whether the sample size is large enough compared to the dimension of the data. In this work, we first describe the notion of uniform-over-$p$ convergences and subsequently, develop a uniform-over-dimension central limit theorem. An asymptotic test for the two-sample equality of locations is developed, which now holds uniformly over the dimension of the observations. Using simulated and real data, it is demonstrated that the proposed test exhibits better performance compared to several popular tests in the literature for high-dimensional data as well as the usual scaled two-sample tests for multivariate data, including the Hotelling's $T^2$ test for multivariate Gaussian data."}

To ensure the security of LAE, it is essential to establish a proper sensing coverage scheme for monitoring the unauthorized targets. Introducing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) into cellular networks is a promising solution that enables coordinated multiple base stations (BSs) to significantly enhance sensing performance and extend coverage. Meanwhile, deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can mitigate signal blockages between BSs and low-altitude targets in urban areas. Therefore, this paper focuses on the low-altitude sensing coverage problem in RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point ISAC networks, where a RIS is employed to enable multiple BSs to sense a prescribed region while serving multiple communication users. A joint beamforming and phase shifts design is proposed to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing sensing signal-to-noise ratio and communication spectral efficiency.

In this context, we revisit the random-field XXZ spin-1/2 chain at zero temperature with ferromagnetic interactions, equivalent to interacting fermions or hard-core bosons in a random potential with attractive interactions. We argue that localization in this model can be characterized by chain-breaking events, which are probed by the extreme values of simple local observables, such as the on-site density or the local magnetization, that are readily accessible in both experiments and numerical simulations. Adopting a bosonic language, we study the disorder-induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition from superfluid (SF) to Bose glass (BG), and focus on the strong disorder regime where localization is driven by weak links. Based on high-precision density matrix renormalization group simulations, we numerically show that extreme local densities accurately capture the BKT transition, even for relatively short chains ranging from a few dozen to a hundred sites. We also discuss the SF-BG transition in the weak disorder regime, where finite-size effects pose greater challenges. Overall, our work seeks to establish a solid foundation for using extreme statistics of local observables, such as density, to probe delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains, both in the ground state and at high energy."}

In these heterogeneous structures, temperature-dependent material properties have an important impact on the thermo-mechanical coupling responses, which is the particular interest in this work.

Since the advent of topological semimetals, where the dispersion is often tilted around the band crossing where the Dirac fermion can appear, tilt has emerged as a key handle that controls physical properties. We study how tilt affects the transport and spectral properties of tilted 2D Dirac fermions under scalar disorder. Although our spectral analyses always show conformity to appropriate Gaussian ensembles, suggestive of delocalization, the conductivity scaling $g(L)$ shows a surprising richness. For a single Dirac node, relevant for quantum Hall transitions and topological insulator surface states, we find $g(L)\\sim a_1\\log(L)$ with a tilt-dependent coefficient $a_1>0$. Interestingly, when the tilt and transport directions are aligned, $a_1$ and hence $g(L)$ shows a spike at the critical point between the type-I and type-II regimes of the Dirac node. For systems with two Dirac nodes with unbroken time-reversal symmetry, pertinent to quasi-2D Dirac materials, we find $g(L)\\sim L^{a_1}(\\log L)^{a_2}$. However, we find a surprising tension between tilt along and perpendicular to the transport directions. For the former, $a_1$ changes sign as a function of tilt, hinting at a tilt-driven localization-delocalization transition, while $a_1<0$ for all tilts in the latter case, implying localization. These localized behaviors also reveal tension with the delocalization seen in spectral properties and suggest differing localization tendencies in real and Hilbert spaces. Overall, our work identifies tilt as an essential control parameter that uncovers rich and unconventional transport physics in 2D Dirac materials."}

Invoking Zeilinger's Foundational Principle, we argue that while the local flow of time, operationally defined as a sequence of detector ``ticks,'' is irreducibly random (one bit per elementary system), the synchronized flow between spatially separated observers depends on their measurement geometry. Comparing the quantum prediction for the coincidence rate with Peres' classical ``bomb fragment'' model, we find that at obtuse relative angles the entangled clock exhibits a 13 percent higher synchronized tick rate than this linear classical benchmark. This ``temporal acceleration'' is linked to contextuality: following Peres, ``unperformed experiments have no results,'' and quantum systems are not constrained to maintain consistency with all counterfactual measurement settings. We stress, however, that for any single measurement angle a suitably tailored classical model can reproduce the quantum rate. The genuinely nonclassical character of the entangled clock emerges only when correlations at several angles are considered simultaneously and are shown to violate Bell-type inequalities. In this sense, the violation of Bell-type bounds serves as a certification that the shared time standard is genuinely quantum."}

To that end, we employ the Bayesian nonparameteric Common Atoms Model, which is a nested clustering algorithm that utilizes a (fixed) group membership for each observation to encourage more similar clustering of members of the same group. CAM operates by assuming each group has its own vector of cluster probabilities, which are themselves clustered to allow similar clustering for some groups. We extend this approach by treating the group membership as an unknown latent variable determined as a flexible nonparametric form of the covariate vector. Consequently, observations with similar predictor values will be in the same latent group and are more likely to be clustered together than observations with disparate predictors. We propose a pyramid group model that flexibly partitions the predictor space into these latent group memberships. This pyramid model operates similarly to a Bayesian regression tree process except that it uses the same splitting rule for at all nodes at the same tree depth which facilitates improved mixing. We outline a block Gibbs sampler to perform posterior inference from our model. Our methodology is demonstrated in simulation and real data examples. In the real data application, we utilize the RAND Health and Retirement Study to cluster and predict patient outcomes in terms of the number of overnight hospital stays."}

The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle."}

A reliability-assessment rule is introduced to detect communication loss during DoS attacks, upon which a switched control mechanism is activated to preserve closed-loop stability and performance. Unlike existing resilient MAS control methods, the proposed strategy explicitly accommodates singular control gains and does not rely on restrictive assumptions such as Lipschitz continuity or prior bounds on nonlinearities. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to integrate neural learning, variable-structure robustness, and reliability-based switching into a unified consensus-tracking control architecture for heterogeneous nonlinear MASs with singular input gains under DoS attacks.

To ensure the security of LAE, it is essential to establish a proper sensing coverage scheme for monitoring the unauthorized targets. Introducing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) into cellular networks is a promising solution that enables coordinated multiple base stations (BSs) to significantly enhance sensing performance and extend coverage. Meanwhile, deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can mitigate signal blockages between BSs and low-altitude targets in urban areas. Therefore, this paper focuses on the low-altitude sensing coverage problem in RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point ISAC networks, where a RIS is employed to enable multiple BSs to sense a prescribed region while serving multiple communication users. A joint beamforming and phase shifts design is proposed to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing sensing signal-to-noise ratio and communication spectral efficiency. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, an efficient algorithm is proposed by using the alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation techniques. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme over the baseline schemes."}

This version summarizes ongoing research; an updated manuscript with extended results will follow. Feedback from colleagues is welcome", "summary": "Spin squeezing is a powerful resource for quantum metrology, and recent hardware platforms based on interacting qubits provide multiple possible architectures to generate and reverse squeezing during a sensing protocol. In this work, we compare the sensing performance of three such architectures: quantum reservoir computers (QRCs), quantum perceptrons, and multi-layer quantum neural networks (QNNs), when used as squeezing-based field sensors. For all models, we consider a standard metrological sequence consisting of coherent-spin preparation, one-axis-twisting dynamics, field encoding via a weak rotation, time-reversal, and collective readout. We show that a single quantum perceptron generates the same optimal sensitivity as a QRC, but in the perturbative regime it benefits from accelerated squeezing due to steering by the output qubit. Stacking perceptrons into a QNN further amplifies this effect: in a 2-layer QNN with N_in input and N_out output qubits, the optimal squeezing time is reduced by a factor of N_out, while the achievable phase sensitivity remains Heisenberg-limited, Delta phi ~ 1/(N_in + N_out). Moreover, if the layers are used sequentially, first using the outputs to squeeze the inputs and then the inputs to squeeze the outputs, the two contributions to the response add constructively. This yields a sqrt(2) enhancement in sensitivity over a QRC when N_in = N_out and requires shorter total squeezing time. Generalizing to L layers, we show that the metrological gain scales as sqrt(L) while the required squeezing time decreases as 1/N_l, where N_l is the number of qubits per layer. Our results demonstrate that the structure of quantum neural networks can be exploited not only for computation, but also to engineer faster and more sensitive squeezing-based quantum sensors."}

Cyqlone unifies algorithms based on the sequential Riccati recursion, parallel Schur complement methods, and cyclic reduction methods, thereby minimizing the required number of floating-point operations, while allowing parallelization across a user-configurable number of processors. Given sufficient parallelism, the solver run time scales with the logarithm of the horizon length (in contrast to the linear scaling of sequential Riccati-based methods), enabling real-time solution of long-horizon problems. Beyond multithreading on multi-core processors, implementations of Cyqlone can also leverage vectorization using batched linear algebra routines. Such batched routines exploit data parallelism using single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations, and expose a higher degree of instruction-level parallelism than their non-batched counterparts. This enables them to significantly outperform BLAS and BLASFEO for the small matrices that arise in optimal control. Building on this high-performance linear solver, we develop CyQPALM, a parallel and optimal-control-specific variant of the QPALM quadratic programming solver. It combines the parallel and vectorized linear algebra operations from Cyqlone with a parallel line search and parallel factorization updates, resulting in order-of-magnitude speedups compared to the state-of-the-art HPIPM solver.

Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies."}

Our findings reveal that the UDW detector responds more when coupled with the fermionic field, and consequently, quantum coherence (for the fermionic case) degrades much more rapidly when compared to the case of the qubit linearly coupled with the scalar field. Moreover, the analysis suggests that particle mass plays a protective role against Unruh-induced decoherence as the rest mass energy becomes comparable to the detector's energy-level spacing, the detector's excitation probability and response decreases, which leads to the mitigation of quantum coherence degradation in accelerated quantum systems."}

The main insight is that nonsmooth algorithms, such as proximal subgradient, proximal point, and their stochastic variants, implicitly minimize a smooth surrogate function induced by the Moreau envelope. Meanwhile, explicit smoothing, which directly minimizes a smooth approximation of the objective, has long been recognized as an efficient strategy for nonsmooth optimization. In this paper, we generalize the notion of smoothable functions, which was proposed by Beck and Teboulle (2012) for nonsmooth convex optimization. This generalization provides a unified viewpoint on several important smoothing techniques for weakly convex optimization, including Nesterov-type smoothing and Moreau envelope smoothing. Our theory yields a framework for designing smooth approximation algorithms for both deterministic and stochastic weakly convex problems with provable complexity guarantees.

Physically accurate noise simulation is needed to train decoders and understand the noise suppression capabilities of quantum error correction codes. In this work, we develop an exact and stabilizer-compatible model of qubit thermal relaxation noise and show that the combined amplitude damping and dephasing channel admits a fully positive probability decomposition into Clifford operations and reset whenever $T_2 \\leqslant T_1$. For $T_2 > T_1$, the resulting decomposition is negative, but allows a smaller sampling overhead versus independent channels. We further introduce an approximated error channel with reset that removes the negativity of the decomposition while achieving higher channel fidelity to the true thermal relaxation than PTA, and extend our construction to finite temperature relaxation. We apply the exact combined model to investigate large surface codes and bivariate bicycle codes on superconducting platforms with realistic thermal relaxation error. The differing logical performances across code states further indicate that noise-model-informed decoders will be essential for accurately capturing thermal-noise structure in future fault-tolerant architectures."}

A neural-variable-structure adaptive controller is developed to achieve leader-follower consensus while ensuring robustness to external disturbances and adaptability to unknown nonlinear dynamics. A reliability-assessment rule is introduced to detect communication loss during DoS attacks, upon which a switched control mechanism is activated to preserve closed-loop stability and performance. Unlike existing resilient MAS control methods, the proposed strategy explicitly accommodates singular control gains and does not rely on restrictive assumptions such as Lipschitz continuity or prior bounds on nonlinearities. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to integrate neural learning, variable-structure robustness, and reliability-based switching into a unified consensus-tracking control architecture for heterogeneous nonlinear MASs with singular input gains under DoS attacks. Lyapunov-based analysis establishes uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals, and Matlab/Simulink simulations on a connected automated vehicle platoon demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resilience."}

Spectral line broadening induced by ensemble averaging is even detrimental to spectroscopy. Here we show a kind of cross-relaxation EPR spectroscopy at zero field, where the sensor is tuned by an amplitude-modulated control field to match the target. The modulation makes detection robust to the sensor's inhomogeneity, while zero-field EPR is naturally robust to the target's inhomogeneity. We demonstrate an efficient EPR measurement on an ensemble of roughly 30000 NV centers.

In recent work, we introduced a constrained variant of this model, in which affine integral equality constraints are imposed along the measure path. In the present paper, we propose a further generalization of this framework, which allows for constraints that apply not just to the density path but also to the momentum and source terms, and incorporates affine inequalities in addition to equality constraints. We prove, under suitable assumptions on the constraints, the well-posedness of the resulting class of convex variational problems. The paper is then primarily devoted to developing an effective numerical pipeline that tackles the corresponding constrained optimization problem based on finite difference discretizations and parallel proximal schemes.

Cyqlone unifies algorithms based on the sequential Riccati recursion, parallel Schur complement methods, and cyclic reduction methods, thereby minimizing the required number of floating-point operations, while allowing parallelization across a user-configurable number of processors. Given sufficient parallelism, the solver run time scales with the logarithm of the horizon length (in contrast to the linear scaling of sequential Riccati-based methods), enabling real-time solution of long-horizon problems. Beyond multithreading on multi-core processors, implementations of Cyqlone can also leverage vectorization using batched linear algebra routines. Such batched routines exploit data parallelism using single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations, and expose a higher degree of instruction-level parallelism than their non-batched counterparts. This enables them to significantly outperform BLAS and BLASFEO for the small matrices that arise in optimal control. Building on this high-performance linear solver, we develop CyQPALM, a parallel and optimal-control-specific variant of the QPALM quadratic programming solver. It combines the parallel and vectorized linear algebra operations from Cyqlone with a parallel line search and parallel factorization updates, resulting in order-of-magnitude speedups compared to the state-of-the-art HPIPM solver.

The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{iβ} = e^{iβ\\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates showing that oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $O(1/|β|)$. The Born rule and the Hilbert-space inner product remain unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical.\n  The physical motivation for the deformation arises from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical quantum-gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{iβ}$. Examples including FRW minisuperspace, quartic potentials, curved-background Hamiltonians, and a Schwarzschild interior-type model illustrate how the mechanism yields explicit decoherence rates. The parameter $β$ may be experimentally constrained through precision coherence measurements in low-noise quantum platforms. The mechanism contrasts with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Diosi-Penrose gravitational collapse, and real-order fractional dynamics in that it acts purely through deterministic spectral phases of a single Hamiltonian. The analysis positions the framework as a compact and testable phenomenological representation of logarithmic spectral corrections appearing in quantum-gravity-motivated effective theories."}

Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies."}

Secondly, the maximin and minimax expressions for tensor phases are given, which are used to quantify how close the phases of a sectorial tensor are to those of its compressions. Thirdly, the compound spectrum, compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of two sectorial tensors $A,B$ are defined and characterized in terms of the compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of the sectorial tensors $A,B$. Fourthly, it is shown that the angles of eigenvalues of the product of two sectorial tensors are upper bounded by the sum of their individual phases. Finally, based on the tensor phase theory developed above, a tensor version of the small phase theorem is presented, which can be regarded as a natural generalization of the matrix case, recently proposed in Ref.

We study the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum of this analogue Lorentz-violating quantum field by spatially separated Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Our analysis reveals key parameter dependencies that optimize the harvesting of entanglement. In particular, unlike the Lorentz-invariant case, smoother detector switchings does not enhance the entanglement harvesting efficiency from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum. Moreover, the strength of the Lorentz-invariant violation can shift the optimal energy structure of the detectors for harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum-a clear deviation from the Lorentz-invariant scenario. As a fundamental quantum mechanical setup, our quantum fluid platform provides an experimentally realizable testbed for examining the entanglement harvesting protocol from an effective Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum using a pair of impurity probers, which may also has potential implications for exploring the Lorentz-invariant violation in quantum field theory."}

This IDE representation reveals a common structural pattern across configurations and clarifies the role played by delayed dynamics in the stability analysis. Within this formulation, the stabilization problem can be handled using existing IDE control techniques. For most configurations, the stabilization of the PDE system requires an approximate spectral controllability assumption. Remarkably, one specific configuration can be stabilized without imposing any additional spectral condition. In contrast, we also provide an explicit example of a configuration for which the required spectral controllability property fails to hold."}

Conventional quantum linear solvers, such as the quantum matrix inverse algorithm (QMIA), focus on approximating the matrix inverse through quantum signal processing (QSP). However, QMIA suffers from a crucial drawback: its computational efficiency deteriorates as the condition number increases. In contrast, classical SPD linear solvers, such as the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods, are known for their fast convergence, which stems from the variational optimization principle of SPD systems. Inspired by this, we develop QGFA, which obtains the solution vector through the gradient-flow process of the corresponding quadratic energy functional. To validate the proposed method, we apply QGFA to the displacement-based finite element method (FEM) for two-dimensional linear elastic problems under plane stress conditions. The algorithm demonstrates accurate convergence toward classical FEM solutions even with a moderate number of QSP phase factors. Compared with QMIA, QGFA achieves lower relative errors and faster convergence when initialized with suitable initial states, demonstrating its potential as an efficient preconditioned quantum linear solver. The proposed framework provides a physically interpretable connection between classical iterative solvers and quantum computational paradigms. These findings suggest that QGFA can serve as a foundation for future developments in Quantum Computer-Aided Engineering (Quantum CAE), including nonlinear and multiphysics simulations."}

We prove that these representations are unitarily equivalent to entangled states of two qubits. This provides a geometric origin of quantum entanglement for photons in the framework of quantum field theory: photons appear as superpositions of backward and forward propagating electromagnetic waves depending on a two valued parameter and this dependency gives rise to correlations between the values of local observables identical to those experienced with an entangled state of two qubits.

Leveraging the spin-dependent supercurrent and circuit-integration flexibility of the ASQ, it is possible to engineer a strong tripartite coupling that jointly excites both qubits upon magnon annihilation (or excites magnons and SCQs upon ASQ deexcitation). Through analytical and numerical studies, we demonstrate that this interaction induces synchronized collapse and revival in qubit populations when the magnon is initially prepared in a coherent state. Notably, during the collapse region -- where populations remain static -- the entanglement structure undergoes a dramatic and continuous reorganization. We show that the genuine tripartite entanglement is redistributed into bipartite entanglement between the two qubits, and vice versa, with the total entanglement conserved. These phenomena, unattainable via two-body couplings, underscore the potential of three-body interactions for exploring intrinsically new quantum effects and advancing hybrid quantum information platforms."}

We show that, for both two- and three-level emitters, this process can be used to deterministically add or subtract a photon to a single propagating optical mode.

Comments and feedback are welcome", "summary": "The fundamental question of when a static or dynamic system should be deemed intrinsically quantum remains a challenge to address in absolute terms. A rigorous criterion, however, can be established by focusing on the measurable or reconstructible features of the system. This determination transcends mere issues of a system's classical simulability or computational complexity. Instead, the critical requirement lies in the certification (ideally, in real-time) of the emergence and persistence of genuine quantum features, principally entanglement and quantum superposition. Quantum Non-Demolition Measurements (QNDM) serve as the appropriate instrument for this certification, both from a theoretical and experimental standpoint. In this review paper, we demonstrate, with accessible clarity, how the implementation of QNDM can be directly linked to a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of macrorealism in finite-dimensional systems, establishing a conceptual parallel with Leggett-Garg inequalities. Using concrete examples that detail the detection of negative terms in the quasi-probability density function resulting from QNDM, we introduce the core concepts for certifying genuinely quantum features. As specific examples, we discuss an application where the quantum-to-classical transition due to the interaction with an environment can be tracked by QNDM. Moreover, we argue about the robustness of QNDM protocols in the presence of noise sources and their advantages with respect to the Leggett-Garg inequalities. Because of its straightforward implementation, the QNDM approach can be of direct relevance to both the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, where a controlled generation and certification of genuinely quantum resources is a central concern."}

We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits.

We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $Θ(1/\\varepsilon)$, matching the known $Ω(1/\\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$).

To appear at the 32nd IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2026)", "summary": "Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key challenge is the design of decoders for real-time quantum error correction (QEC), which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle common, sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources present in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below a useful level in practical scenarios. Furthermore, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization.\n  To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22 nm FDSOI technology, we achieve a peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 4 K power budget of 1.5 W, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21."}

In this work, we challenge this conventional wisdom by showing that QEM can continue to provide substantial benefits in the era of quantum error correction (QEC), and in an even more efficient manner than it does on current devices. We introduce a framework for logical-level QEM that leverages soft information naturally produced by QEC decoders, requiring no additional data, hardware modifications, or runtime overhead beyond what QEC protocols already provide. Within this framework, we develop and analyze three logical-level QEM techniques: post-selection and runtime abort policies, probabilistic error cancellation, and zero-noise extrapolation. Our techniques reduce logical error rates by more than 100x while discarding fewer than 0.1% of shots; they also provide in situ characterization of logical channels for QEM protocols. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our approach using a surface-code architecture and two state-of-the-art decoders based on tensor-network contraction and minimum-weight perfect matching. We evaluate logical-level QEM on random Clifford circuits and molecular simulation algorithms and find that, compared to previous approaches relying on QEC only or QEC combined with QEM, we can achieve up to 87.4% spacetime overhead savings. Our results demonstrate that logical-level QEM with QEC decoder soft information can reliably improve logical performance, underscoring the efficiency and usefulness of QEM techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computers."}

Here, we present an experimental photonic platform capable of simulating a non-unitary quantum walk generated by a peculiar type of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, largely unexplored in the literature. The novelty of this platform lies in its direct access to the reciprocal space, which enables us to scan the quasi-momentum across the entire Brillouin zone and thus achieve a precise tomographic reconstruction of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, indicated by the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. From the inferred Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve complex-valued band structures, resolve exceptional points in momentum space, and detect the associated parity-time symmetry breaking through eigenvector coalescence. Our results, presented entirely in quasi-momentum space, represent a substantial shift in perspective in the study of non-Hermitian phenomena."}

The first Hamiltonian operator is non-Hermitian but isomorphic to an Hermitian operator. It appears to exhibit the same two-fold degeneracy as the particle on a circular path. More precisely, $E_n=n^2E_1,\\ n=1,2,\\ldots$ (in addition to an exact eigenvalue $E_0=0$). The second Hamiltonian operator is Hermitian and does not exhibit such degeneracy. In this case the nth excited energy level splits at the nth order of perturbation theory. Both models can be described in terms of the same point-group symmetry."}

In this context, we revisit the random-field XXZ spin-1/2 chain at zero temperature with ferromagnetic interactions, equivalent to interacting fermions or hard-core bosons in a random potential with attractive interactions. We argue that localization in this model can be characterized by chain-breaking events, which are probed by the extreme values of simple local observables, such as the on-site density or the local magnetization, that are readily accessible in both experiments and numerical simulations. Adopting a bosonic language, we study the disorder-induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition from superfluid (SF) to Bose glass (BG), and focus on the strong disorder regime where localization is driven by weak links. Based on high-precision density matrix renormalization group simulations, we numerically show that extreme local densities accurately capture the BKT transition, even for relatively short chains ranging from a few dozen to a hundred sites. We also discuss the SF-BG transition in the weak disorder regime, where finite-size effects pose greater challenges. Overall, our work seeks to establish a solid foundation for using extreme statistics of local observables, such as density, to probe delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains, both in the ground state and at high energy."}

Our analysis focuses on the leaky quantum standard map (QSM) of the kicked rotor. We compare its complex resonance spectrum with both Ginibre and truncated circular orthogonal ensembles (TCOEs). We find that the long-lived resonances follow TCOE statistics, reproducing the density of states and level spacing correlations, but depart from Ginibre predictions. Short-lived resonances, however, do not show a clear correspondence with either random-matrix ensemble. We also demonstrate that increasing the leak size takes the density of states of the TCOE toward the Ginibre limit, yet their spectral correlations remain distinct."}

Among the various experimental approaches to detect topological properties, the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) has emerged as a powerful bulk probe in one-dimensional chiral systems, allowing the extraction of the topological invariant from single-particle dynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to multiple cavity modes via inter-cell hopping terms, focusing on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the MCD. We show that, whenever the frequency is larger than the static hopping amplitudes, the coupling induces a discontinuous jump in the MCD, already at small times, signaling that such a coupling also leaves a signature in the survival edge probability when the dynamics are initialized at one of the two edges. For frequencies comparable to the static hopping amplitudes, topological order competes with dissipative effects, which makes the MCD behave smoothly, retaining information about the driven-dissipative topology."}

These conserved quantities are related to the microscopic quantum degrees of freedom that are spatially localized. Here, we present a general framework for constructing exact LIOMs with the desired locality and quantum numbers supplied as input rather than arising as emergent properties. We show that one can express the task of finding LIOMs as an optimization problem. In simple cases, solving this problem amounts to matrix diagonalization, while in more complex settings, it connects to the question of finding classical ground states of spin-glass models. We illustrate our theory using paradigmatic examples of single-particle Anderson localization and MBL in interacting spin chains. These developments unify previous results and reveal intriguing connections among many-body localization, spin-glass physics and constrained optimization problems."}
