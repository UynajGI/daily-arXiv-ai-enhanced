A\ntwo-dimensional extension of SiZer, known as Significance in Scale Space (SSS),\nwas developed for image data, enabling the detection of both slopes and\ncurvatures across multiple spatial scales. However, fully valid inference for\n2-D SSS has remained unavailable, largely due to the more complex dependence\nstructure of random fields. In this paper, we use a completely different\nprobability methodology which gives an advanced distribution theory for SSS,\nestablishing a valid hypothesis testing procedure for both slope and curvature\ndetection. When applied to pure noise images (no true underlying signal), the\nproposed method controls the Type I error, whereas the original SSS identifies\nspurious features across scales. When signal is present, the proposed method\nmaintains a high level of statistical power, successfully identifying important\ntrue slopes and curvatures in real data such as gamma camera images."}

Based on subspace perturbation theory, we reveal that\nGFM and GFL subsystems can be effectively decoupled when GFL converters operate\nnear unity power factor or when GFM converters possess sufficiently large\ninertia or damping, and provide lower bound of control parameters ensuring\ndecoupling. Under the decoupling condition, we propose decentralized and\nanalytical parameter-based stability criteria which have clear physical\ninterpretations: the positive damping of converters compensates for the\nnegative damping of the network. In the case of coupling, we also propose\ndecentralized stability criteria based on the small phase theorem. The\neffectiveness of the theoretical analysis is validated through simulations in\nMATLAB/Simulink."}

Neural Network Backflow\n(NNBF) is a powerful variational ansatz that enhances mean-field wave functions\nby introducing configuration-dependent modifications to single-particle\norbitals. Although NNBF is theoretically universal in the limit of large\nnetworks, we find that practical gains saturate with increasing network size.\nInstead, significant improvements can be achieved by using a multi-determinant\nansatz. We explore efficient ways to generate these multi-determinant\nexpansions without increasing the number of variational parameters. In\nparticular, we study single-step Lanczos and symmetry projection techniques,\nbenchmarking their performance against diffusion Monte Carlo and NNBF applied\nto alternative mean fields. Benchmarking on a doped periodic square Hubbard\nmodel near optimal doping, we find that a Lanczos step, diffusion Monte Carlo,\nand projection onto a symmetry sector all give similar improvements achieving\nstate-of-the-art energies at minimal cost. By further optimizing the projected\nsymmetrized states directly, we gain significantly in energy.

In recent\nyears, content-based emerging platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Bilibili\nhave diverged fundamentally in their underlying logic from traditional\nconnection-based social platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn. Empirical data on\nfollower counts and follower-count-based rankings reveal that the distribution\nof social power varies significantly across different types of platforms, with\ncontent-based platforms exhibiting notably greater inequality. Here we propose\ntwo fundamental network formation mechanisms: a meritocracy-based model and a\nMatthew-effect-based model, designed to capture the formation logic underlying\ntraditional and emerging social networks, respectively. Through theoretical and\nnumerical analysis, we demonstrate that both models replicate salient\nstatistical features of social networks including scale-free and small-world\nproperty, while also closely match empirical patterns on the relationship\nbetween in-degrees and in-degree rankings, thereby capturing the distinctive\ndistributions of social power in respective platforms.

For the continuous problem under weakly and strongly damping\nparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta,$ respectively, a novel approach usually used\nfor linear parabolic problems is employed to derive an exponential decay\nproperty with explicit rates, which depend on model parameters and the\nprincipal eigenvalue of the associated linear elliptic operator for the\ndifferent cases of parameters such as $(i) \\;\\alpha, \\beta >0$, $ (ii)\\;\n\\alpha>0, \\beta \\geq 0$ and $(iii)\\;\\alpha \\geq 0, \\beta >0$. Subsequently, for\na semi-discrete finite element scheme keeping the temporal variable continuous,\noptimal error estimates are derived that preserve exponential decay behavior.\nSome generalizations that include forcing terms and spatially as well as\ntime-varying damping parameters are discussed. Moreover, an abstract discrete\nproblem is discussed, and as a consequence, uniform decay estimates for finite\ndifference as well as spectral approximations to the damped system are briefly\nindicated. A complete discrete scheme is developed and analyzed after applying\na finite difference scheme in time, which again preserves the exponential decay\nproperty. The given proofs involve several energies with energy-based\ntechniques to derive the consistency between continuous and discrete decay\nrates, in which the constants involved do not blow up as $\\alpha\\to 0$ and\n$\\beta\\to 0$. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted whose\nresults support the theoretical findings, illustrate uniform decay rates, and\nexplore the effects of parameters on stability and accuracy."}

A sensible approach is to use stochastic optimization to handle\nsuch uncertainties, which can lead to infeasible problems or loss in revenues\nif not chosen appropriately. This paper presents three efficient two-stage\nstochastic optimization methods: risk-neutral, robust, and chance-constrained,\nto address the impact of CER uncertainties for aggregators who participate in\nenergy and regulation services markets in the Australian National Electricity\nMarket. Furthermore, these methods utilize the flexibility of BES, considering\nprecise state-of-charge dynamics and complementarity constraints, aiming for\nscalable performance while managing uncertainty. The problems are formed as\ntwo-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programs, with relaxations adopted\nfor large scenario sets.

In recent years, constraints\ninvolving signed angle (SA) and ratio of distance (RoD) have been adopted in\nSNL due to their ease of measurements and independence of the global\ncoordinate. However, most prior works consider homogeneous nodes, i.e., all the\nsensors have the same perceptual abilities. Although mixed constraints have\nbeen considered recently, little is known about how the bipartition of nodes\nbased on perceptual abilities affects the rigidity property of the network.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel SA-RoD rigidity theory for graphs with\nheterogeneous vertices, where each vertex corresponds to a sensor node\ncapturing either SA or RoD measurements. Unlike existing rigidity theory, the\nSA-RoD rigidity is shown to be strongly dependent on bipartitions of nodes, and\nexhibits a duality. Moreover, the shape of an SA-RoD constrained network can be\nuniquely determined up to uniform rotations, translations, and scalings (global\nSA-RoD rigidity) even if it is neither globally RoD rigid nor globally SA\nrigid. A scalable approach to construction of globally SA-RoD rigid frameworks\nis proposed.

In a unified framework, the SAFE bootstrap yields\nbias-corrected point estimates and standard errors for any effect size\nstatistic, regardless of whether the outcome is continuous or discrete.

Our study shows that the\nperformance of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) or Deep Ritz Method\n(DRM) using linear SNNs with power ReLU activation is dominated by their\ninherent ill-conditioning and spectral bias against high frequencies. Although\nthis can be alleviated by using non-homogeneous activation functions with\nproper scaling, achieving such adaptivity for nonlinear SNNs remains costly due\nto ill-conditioning."}

By\nleveraging their gradient flow structure, we use minimizing movements as the\nvariational formulation and compute these cross-diffusion systems by solving\nthe minimizing movements as optimization problems at the fully discrete level.\nOur strategy to solve the optimization problems is the PDFB splitting method\noutlined in our previous work \\cite{PDFB2024}. The efficiency of the proposed\nPDFB splitting method is demonstrated on several challenging cross-diffusion\nequations from the literature."}
