We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter."}

Sub-micron geometric coordinate markers were etched into SiO2/Si wafers, serving as both substrates for 2D device integration and guiding maps for sample navigation. Here, we used a monolayer graphene/h-BN device with an active area of smaller than 20 um x 20 um as a model system and demonstrated that the device could be reliably located in STM solely through topographic imaging of the guiding patterns and in situ stage calibration, without reliance on optical viewports or capacitive sensing. Atomically resolved topographic imaging and tunneling spectroscopy were also obtained. Our proposed navigation strategy is fully compatible with standard device fabrication procedures and requires no hardware modification to existing STM setups. As such, it offers a practical alternative for locating miniaturized devices in STM, shedding light on studying emerging quantum phenomena in 2D systems."}

An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $ε$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $ε$ in the two limits of small or large $κ$.

Despite relatively routine use in practice, how pathfinder operations evolve under uncertainty and how the pathfinder decision-making process unfolds are largely treated as exogenous. Addressing this gap requires jointly modeling weather-driven system accessibility, flight responses to pathfinder offers, and the sequencing of those offers to improve outcomes. We develop a unified analytical framework that connects weather-driven system state transitions, flight acceptance decisions, and the sequencing of pathfinder offers. We first construct a four-state Markov chain to model stochastic closure and reopening of exit points, or fixes, out of the terminal departure airspace surrounding a major airport, pathfinder selection, and pathfinding execution, and analyze its steady-state behavior to characterize long-term capacity and delay implications. We introduce utility-based decision models for flights, air traffic control (ATC), and dispatchers, and analyze worst-case collective rejection to quantify system vulnerability under selfless behavior and uncertainty. Finally, we formulate optimization problems that model ATC-initiated and dispatcher-initated pathfinder offers, with the goal of optimizing the sequence of pathfinder offers. Using a discrete event simulation for a major US airport, we show that ATC- and dispatcher-driven objectives lead to distinct, near real-time sequencing strategies, providing the first formal decision models for pathfinder operations under weather uncertainty."}

We prove an exact decomposition theorem showing how classical scalar assortativity collapses heterogeneous interior-boundary interactions into a single number. We then study a SIS epidemic model and consider equilibrium infection probabilities as node attributes. Under mild connectivity and positivity assumptions, we show that boundary dominance (a dynamical concentration of infection mass on interface nodes) implies a strictly negative boundary-to-interior assortativity component. This establishes a rigorous link between directed conductance, equilibrium flow geometry, and the sign structure of assortative mixing induced by the dynamics. Our results demonstrate that assortativity profiles encode dynamical information invisible to scalar summaries and provide a mathematically grounded bridge between network partition geometry and nonlinear dynamics on graphs."}

Both models adapt the properties of their ensembles to the type of event, either convective or stratiform. The spatial scores of the STEPS and LDCast ensembles are compared with those of surrogate ensembles having some key properties, revealing that both STEPS and LDCast have very little ability to spatially localise the ensemble mean error vector through their ensemble members.

Submitted to IMA Journal of Management Mathematics", "summary": "Option pricing in real markets faces fundamental challenges. The Black--Scholes--Merton (BSM) model assumes constant volatility and uses a linear generator $g(t,x,y,z)=-ry$, while lacking explicit behavioral factors, resulting in systematic departures from observed dynamics. This paper extends the BSM model by learning a nonlinear generator within a deep Forward--Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) framework. We propose a dual-network architecture where the value network $u_θ$ learns option prices and the generator network $g_φ$ characterizes the pricing mechanism, with the hedging strategy $Z_t=σ_t X_t \\nabla_x u_θ$ obtained via automatic differentiation. The framework adopts forward recursion from a learnable initial condition $Y_0=u_θ(0,\\cdot)$, naturally accommodating volatility trajectory and sentiment features. Empirical results on CSI 300 index options show that our method reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 32.2\\% and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 35.3\\% compared with BSM. Interpretability analysis indicates that architectural improvements are effective across all option types, while the information advantage is asymmetric between calls and puts. Specifically, call option improvements are primarily driven by sentiment features, whereas put options show more balanced contributions from volatility trajectory and sentiment features. This finding aligns with economic intuition regarding option pricing mechanisms."}

We formulate operator assembly in the tensor train (TT) format, producing seven-dimensional operators for both fixed-source and $k$-eigenvalue neutron transport problems solved using the restarted Generalized Minimum Residual Method (GMRES) and power iteration with an uncompressed solution vector. Our results on single-patch homogeneous and multi-patch heterogeneous problems, including a cruciform-shaped fuel array inspired by advanced reactor fuel designs, demonstrate the TT format's ability to compress interior operators from petabytes to megabytes, whereas the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix format requires gigabytes of storage. However, highly coupled boundary operators present a significant challenge for TT. Despite the storage savings, TT formatted operators increase time-to-solution relative to CSR as an uncompressed solution vector forces operator-vector product scaling of $O(dr^2N^d\\log(N))$ for TT while CSR scales at $O(\\text{nnz})$. We mitigate this discrepancy by using mixed formats with interior operators in TT, while high-rank boundary operators remain in CSR format. We compare all results to Monte Carlo (MC) and analytic reference solutions. While CSR remains $<10\\times$ faster than this mixed format, the TDIGA method enables high-fidelity transport for expensive high-order IGA meshes."}

However, in the absence of explicit intrinsic principles for semantic composition, existing methods treat synergistic drugs as independent entities and fail to capture their collective therapeutic effects, resulting in a mismatch between medication-level references and longitudinal patient representations. In this paper, we propose MSAM, a novel medication recommendation model that bridges the gap via multi-level medication abstraction. The model introduces a multi-head graph reasoning mechanism to organize flat daily medication sets into clinically meaningful semantic units, serving as intermediate abstraction results to propagate features from individual drugs to higher-level representations. Building on these units, MSAM performs two-stage abstraction over historical prescriptions and selected candidates via intra- and inter-level feature propagation across heterogeneous clinical structures, capturing collective therapeutic effects aligned with patient conditions. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets show that MSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of structural medication abstraction for recommendation."}

This quantity is directly related to the confining mechanism which generates the flux tube and can be used to test its properties. We study a wide range of different values of lattice spacing, temperature and flux tube lengths and show that our data are precise enough to distinguish between different confining models. In particular we show that at high temperatures (just below the deconfinement transition) the data are perfectly described by an Ising-like effective model based on the Svetitsky-Yaffe mapping. At lower temperatures this approximation does not hold anymore. In this regime (which is the most interesting one from a physical point of view) we test several alternative proposals and show that the dual superconductor model is the one which better fits the data. However, this proposal is not fully satisfactory, because the values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter extracted from the fits increase with the length of the flux tube, which is not a feature predicted by the model. This suggests that a more sophisticated model is needed to explain confinement in non-abelian gauge theories and, at the same time, that our data on the intrinsic width may be a powerful tool to benchmark these candidates."}

Our first contribution is a general importance-sampling theory for mixture targets and proposals, including variance comparisons between individual- and mixture-based estimators. We then interpret the stochastic EnKF analysis as sampling from explicit Gaussian-mixture proposals obtained by conditioning on the current or previous ensemble, which leads to six self-normalized IS-EnKF schemes. We embed these updates into a broader class of ensemble-based filters and prove consistency and error bounds, including weight-variance comparisons and sufficient conditions ensuring finite-variance importance weights. As a second contribution, we construct transported quasi-Monte Carlo (TQMC) point sets for the Gaussian-mixture laws arising in prediction and analysis, yielding TQMC-enhanced variants that can substantially reduce sampling error without changing the filtering pipeline. Numerical experiments on benchmark models compare the proposed mixture-weighted and TQMC-enhanced filters, showing improved filtering accuracy relative to BPF, EnKF, and the standard weighted EnKF, and that the weighted schemes eliminate the EnKF error plateau often caused by analysis-target mismatch."}

These models are empirically evaluated against leading machine learning techniques Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression across seven macro-financial and energy variables, with Brent crude oil as the central asset. The findings reveal three major insights. First, TVP-SVAR consistently outperforms standard VAR models, confirming structural instability in energy transmission channels. Second, copula-based extensions capture non-linear and tail dependence more effectively than symmetric DCC models, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. Third, despite their methodological differences, copula-enhanced econometric models and GPR achieve statistically equivalent predictive accuracy (t-test p = 0.8444). However, only the econometric approach provides interpretable impulse responses, regime shifts, and tail-risk diagnostics.

Here, we extend the neuroevolution potential (NEP), a highly efficient machine-learned interatomic potential, to a charge-aware framework (qNEP) by introducing explicit, environment-dependent partial charges. Each ionic partial charge is represented by a neural network as a function of the local descriptor vector, analogous to the NEP site-energy model. This formulation enables the direct prediction of the Born effective charge tensor for each ion and, consequently, the polarization. As a result, dielectric properties, infrared spectra, and coupling to external electric fields can be evaluated within a unified framework. We derive consistent expressions for the forces and virials that explicitly account for the position dependence of the partial charges. The qNEP method has been implemented in the free-and-open-source GPUMD package, with support for both Ewald summation and particle-particle particle-mesh treatments of electrostatics. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the qNEP approach through representative applications to water, Li7La3Zr2O12, BaTiO3, and a magnesium-water interface. These results show that qNEP enables accurate atomistic simulations with explicit long-range electrostatics, scalable to million-atom systems on nanosecond time scales using consumer-grade GPUs."}

To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a Geometric Sparrow Search Algorithm (GeoSSA). By integrating Good Nodes Set initialization, a Sine-Cosine Enhanced Producer position update strategy, and a Triangular-Walk Enhanced Edge Sparrow update strategy, GeoSSA significantly improves the global exploration ability, local exploitation efficiency, and convergence stability of the original SSA. To thoroughly validate the effectiveness of GeoSSA, we conducted ablation studies, qualitative analysis, and comparative experiments on 23 benchmark functions against state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that GeoSSA achieves the best or near-best performance in terms of average fitness, standard deviation, Wilcoxon tests, and Friedman rankings, with an Overall Effectiveness ($OE$) of 95.65\\%. Its overall performance is significantly superior to all compared algorithms. In three-dimensional UAV path planning tasks, GeoSSA demonstrates excellent stability and superior path quality. In four categories of engineering design optimization problems, GeoSSA consistently attains the highest solution accuracy and strongest stability. GeoSSA not only exhibits outstanding global optimization performance on standard benchmark functions but also shows strong robustness and generalization ability in practical applications such as UAV path planning and engineering design. Therefore, GeoSSA provides an efficient and reliable solution framework for complex optimization problems."}

We focus on the quantum correlations of one of the two SQI subsystems, $S$, in the ground state of the global system, and study their dependence on both the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part $E$ and the intercoupling strength. We concentrate on regimes in which $S$ develops critical long-range correlations. The most interesting physical scenario arises when both SQI subsystems are critical. In particular, for identical SQI subsystems, the global system is equivalent to the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, characterized by an additional $Z_2$ interchange symmetry between the two subsystem operators.

Applying these principles uniformly dissolves each puzzle without new physics or ad hoc interpretive machinery.

(2025) compared perceived scientist trustworthiness across 68 countries/regions and examined its associations with individual- and country-level factors. While the authors reported that the scale did not satisfy metric and scalar measurement invariance, their subsequent cross-national/regional comparisons and regressions were nonetheless conducted using weighted means of observed item scores, implicitly assuming cross-country/region comparability at the observed-score level. Using the publicly shared dataset, we re-evaluated these conclusions by systematically applying measurement alignment under four analytical paths: pooled-sample versus country/region-specific confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), each estimated with and without weights. Across all specifications, cross-national/regional CFA supported configural and metric invariance but failed to establish scalar or strict invariance. Importantly, under the analytical path most closely corresponding to the original study (pooled CFA with weights), only the competence and openness factors yielded admissible aligned solutions within the four-factor model. Using aligned latent scores for these two dimensions, country/region rankings changed for 62 of the 68 countries/regions. Substantive conclusions also differed: associations between perceived scientist trustworthiness and science-related populist attitudes or social dominance orientation were near zero or non-robust, whereas attitudes toward science remained strongly and positively related. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that cross-national/regional comparisons based on observed-score averages may be misleading when measurement equivalence is not established, and that latent-variable approaches such as alignment provide a more defensible basis for international inference."}

In the second region the problem to find polynomial time algorithms is very similar to the problem to find polynomial time algorithms to determine the asymptotic behavior of discrete dynamical systems in the chaotic regime. We cannot exclude the existence of a third region which separates the first two: this region would have the characteristics of the edge of chaos. We focuss on the Wang tiling problem of an N X N square (with N large): here a Wang tiles set Gamma is an alphabet. We construct a statistical-physics inspired heuristic which allows to define good alphabets as the ones with a good thermodynamical behavior. For (a suitable subclass of) good alphabets we construct an algortihm which, in polynomial time, determines how to tile the N x N square. On the other hand, for bad alphabets, we observe a chaotic behavior. The Cook-Levin theorem advocate a similar pattern for all the NP-complete problems."}

Events were recorded coherently by the global neutron monitor network and by SEVAN detectors at multiple altitudes. Using spectrometric capabilities, we reconstruct energy spectra of missing neutrons and muons during the FD and compare them with corresponding spectra measured during GLE77. The analysis demonstrates that FD and GLE signatures are intrinsically asymmetric. FDs selectively suppress the preexisting galactic cosmic ray population, whereas GLEs introduce an additional, harder particle component. Neutron and muon channels exhibit markedly different spectral behavior, particularly at higher deposited energies, reflecting their sensitivity to different primary energy ranges. These results show that combined NM and SEVAN observations provide robust, complementary diagnostics of rigidity dependent cosmic ray modulation during extreme heliospheric disturbances."}

Originally published by Starr in the context of quasi-equilibrium in nonconvex market models in economics, the lemma has since found widespread use in optimization, particularly for estimating the duality gap of the Lagrangian dual of separable nonconvex problems. Given its foundational nature, we pose the following geometric question: Is it possible for the nonconvexity of the Minkowski sum of $n$-dimensional nonconvex sets to even diminish instead of just not accumulating as the number of summands increases, under some general conditions? We answer this affirmatively. First, we provide an elementary geometric proof of the Shapley-Folkman Lemma based on the facial structure of the convex hull of each set. This leads to refinement of the classical error bound derived from the lemma. Building on this new geometric perspective, we further show that when most of the sets satisfy a certain local smoothness condition which naturally arises in the epigraphs of smooth functions, their Minkowski sum converges directly to a convex set, with a vanishing nonconvexity measure. In optimization, this implies that the Lagrangian dual of block-structured smooth nonconvex problems with potentially additional sparsity constraints is asymptotically tight under mild assumptions, which contracts nonvanishing duality gap obtained via classical Shapley-Folkman Lemma."}

We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter. While pointwise predictions inevitably diverge at long times, the transformer faithfully reproduces the statistical \"climate\" of the chaos, including temporal correlations and characteristic decay scales.

At low temperatures, we find a smooth crossover between a uniform ferromagnet and domain-textured state, in which the spins locally follow the sign of the interlayer exchange. We demonstrate that there is no breaking of layer symmetry for twisted bilayers. The location of the crossover is determined by a simple geometric energy balance between bulk interlayer exchange and intralayer domain-wall costs.

The number of gun injuries largely varies spatially because of county-wise heterogeneity of race, sex, age, and income distributions. But still, a major challenge is to locally identify the influential socio-economic factors behind these firearm fatality incidents. For a diverging number of predictors, a rich literature exists regarding SCAD under the independence framework; however, a vacuum remains when discussing local variable selection for spatially correlated, over-dispersed data. This research presents a two-step localized variable selection and inference framework for spatially indexed gunshot fatality data. In the first step, we select variables locally using the SCAD penalty for specific locations where the number of gunshot incidents exceeds a threshold. For these locations, after selecting the predictors, we proceed to the next step, which involves examining the directional variation in the latent spatial neighborhood structure. We further discuss the theoretical properties of this county-specific local variable selection under infill asymptotics. This method has threefold advantages: (i) this method selects the variables locally, (ii) this method provides inference about directional variation of a selected predictor, and (iii) instead of assuming the spatial neighborhood structure in an ad hoc manner, this method identifies the specific type of spatial neighborhood structure that is most appropriate for modeling the random effects."}

Such inconsistencies are referred to as preference falsification and the intention-behavior gap, respectively. Both hamper collective decision-making and adaptation, complicating policy formulation and implementation. To simulate these phenomena, dual-layer opinion agent-based models are used, in which each agent holds both a private and an expressed (public) opinion. Within the $q$-voter framework, two expressed-private opinion (EPO) models have been introduced in which private and expressed opinions are updated synchronously; two variants differ only by the presence of self-anticonformity, a mechanism in which an agent may set its private opinion opposite to its current expressed opinion, breaking internal harmony and creating a state akin to cognitive dissonance. Here, we extend these models by introducing an asynchronous update: in each elementary step, an agent updates its private opinion with probability $α$ or its expressed opinion with complementary probability; hence the name $α$-EPO models. Using Monte Carlo simulations on both artificial and real organizational social networks, along with mean-field and pair approximation analyses, we show that self-anticonformity makes collective outcomes robust to behavioral volatility tuned by $α$, enhances collective agreement, and suppresses hysteresis. In contrast, without self-anticonformity, $α$ affects the nature of the transition between agreement and disagreement: higher values of $α$ suppress hysteresis and enhance overall agreement."}

The methodology employs the \"discretize-then-project\" consistent flux strategy, which ensures mass conservation and pressure-velocity coupling without requiring auxiliary stabilization like boundary control or pressure stabilization techniques. However, because standard Galerkin projection fails to yield physically consistent results for the turbulent viscosity field, a hybrid strategy is adopted: velocity and pressure are resolved via intrusive projection, while the turbulent viscosity is reconstructed using a non-intrusive data-driven closure. We evaluate three neural network architectures, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Transformers, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to model the temporal evolution of the viscosity coefficients. Validated against a 3D Large Eddy Simulation of a lid-driven cavity, the LSTM-based closure demonstrates superior performance in capturing transient dynamics, achieving relative errors of 0.7\\% for velocity and 4\\% for turbulent viscosity. The resulting framework effectively combines the mathematical rigor of the consistent flux formulation with the adaptability of deep learning for turbulence modeling."}

Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics."}

In the second region the problem to find polynomial time algorithms is very similar to the problem to find polynomial time algorithms to determine the asymptotic behavior of discrete dynamical systems in the chaotic regime. We cannot exclude the existence of a third region which separates the first two: this region would have the characteristics of the edge of chaos. We focuss on the Wang tiling problem of an N X N square (with N large): here a Wang tiles set Gamma is an alphabet. We construct a statistical-physics inspired heuristic which allows to define good alphabets as the ones with a good thermodynamical behavior. For (a suitable subclass of) good alphabets we construct an algortihm which, in polynomial time, determines how to tile the N x N square.

In this study, high-quality attitude determination results obtained from star sensors and a fiber optical gyro (FOG) are treated as ground truth, and machine learning is applied to coarse attitude sensor data consisting of Sun sensors and magnetic field sensors. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D) is employed to regressively predict attitude from short sequences of time-series sensor measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using five sets of on-orbit observation logs, with four passes used for training and one independent pass used for testing. The results show that, while conventional coarse attitude determination using the TRIAD method yields attitude errors on the order of 7 deg RMS, the proposed machine-learning approach achieves RMS errors of approximately 0.7 deg for the training data and 2-3 deg for the test data, depending on the sensor combination."}

These models are empirically evaluated against leading machine learning techniques Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression across seven macro-financial and energy variables, with Brent crude oil as the central asset. The findings reveal three major insights. First, TVP-SVAR consistently outperforms standard VAR models, confirming structural instability in energy transmission channels. Second, copula-based extensions capture non-linear and tail dependence more effectively than symmetric DCC models, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. Third, despite their methodological differences, copula-enhanced econometric models and GPR achieve statistically equivalent predictive accuracy (t-test p = 0.8444). However, only the econometric approach provides interpretable impulse responses, regime shifts, and tail-risk diagnostics. We conclude that machine learning can replicate predictive performance but cannot substitute the explanatory power of structural econometrics.

In traditional settings, disorder strongly impedes transport, resulting in dynamical localization or, at best, sub-ballistic or diffusive dynamics. A distinct and previously unobserved regime, erratic non-Hermitian skin localization (ENHSL), can arise in globally reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices with disorder. It features macroscopic, disorder-dependent localization at irregular bulk positions with subexponential decay, linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. We realize this regime experimentally in an acoustic lattice implementing a disordered Hatano-Nelson chain with imaginary gauge fields. Using Green's-function-based spectroscopy together with time-resolved measurements on the same platform, we reconstruct the full complex spectrum and eigenstates, and directly observe wave-packet dynamics. Remarkably, we observe ballistic transport despite strong spectral localization. We develop a transport theory that connects the dominant propagation site to the maximal random-walk excursion within an expanding light cone and predicts a universal Levy-arcsine statistics, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results decouple eigenstate localization from transport and establish ENHSL as a new paradigm for wave dynamics."}

This framework handles both logarithmic and Cauchy singularities through a common set of integral transformations, eliminating the need for case-by-case analytical singularity extraction and enabling straightforward numerical quadrature.

In particular, they might suffer from slowing down towards the end of a simulation due to the diffusive nature of random walks. In this work we apply irreversibility to the multicanonical Monte Carlo method via the lifting approach to alleviate this behavior. We achieve a 2-4 times speedup in ground-state search for a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, and up to an order of magnitude of speedup for finding the ground-state energy in an Edwards-Anderson spin glass, compared to traditional multicanonical sampling. The round-trip times between ground states show a narrower distribution and are significantly shorter compared to the reversible counterpart, suggesting that a lower convergence time with a smaller time variance is feasible."}

Our results reveal nonlinear dynamics across urban space, with powerlaw behavior in central zones and logarithmic saturation in peripheral areas, suggesting differentiated growth regimes. Notably, firm longevity modulates the relationship between abundance and diversity, particularly in periurban transition zones. These spatial patterns point to an emerging polycentric restructuring within a traditionally monocentric metropolis. By integrating economic complexity theory with spatial analysis, our approach provides a scalable method to assess the adaptive capacity of urban economies.

As a result, for these problems, a broader range of RK methods, including the classical fourth-order, four-stage RK scheme, can be used while the numerical integration remains stable.

The existence of the de Almeida-Thouless (dAT) transition for three-dimensional (3D) spin glasses in a field is still debated. We introduce a new computational method to define the spin-glass susceptibility, which is robust against the broad tail in the overlap distribution that undermines conventional analyses. Applying this approach to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model in 2D and 3D, and contrasting with the 3D Ising (without disorder) and mean-field spin-glass models, we find a stark difference: the locus of susceptibility maxima bends to the right in the field-temperature plane for the Ising and 2D spin-glass cases, indicating a supercritical crossover line, but bends to the left for the mean-field and 3D spin glasses - a signature of the dAT line. Finite-size scaling further suggests that the peak susceptibility diverges with system size in 3D spin glasses under a field, while saturating in 2D. These results provide direct numerical evidence for the dAT transition in 3D, supporting the replica symmetry breaking scenario."}

We derive the ``\\rot,'' a fast, closed-form bandwidth selector based on the unweighted Asymptotic Mean Integrated Squared Error (AMISE) of a beta reference distribution. To address boundary integrability issues, we introduce a principled heuristic for U-shaped and J-shaped distributions. By employing a method-of-moments approximation, we reduce the bandwidth selection complexity from iterative optimization to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our rule matches the accuracy of numerical optimization while delivering a speedup of over 35,000 times.

The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior.

We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter. While pointwise predictions inevitably diverge at long times, the transformer faithfully reproduces the statistical \"climate\" of the chaos, including temporal correlations and characteristic decay scales.

Recently, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC) has emerged as a promising estimand, offering quantile-level summaries akin to the conditional quantile treatment effect (CQTE) while preserving some interpretability of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). It achieves this by summarising the treated response conditional on both the covariates and the untreated response. Despite these desirable properties, the CQC's current estimation is limited by the need to first estimate the difference in conditional cumulative distribution functions and then invert it. This inversion obscures the CQC estimate, hampering our ability to both model and interpret it. To address this, we propose the first direct estimator of the CQC, allowing for explicit modelling and parameterisation. This explicit parameterisation enables better interpretation of our estimate while also providing a means to constrain and inform the model. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that our estimation error depends directly on the complexity of the CQC itself, improving upon the existing estimation procedure. Furthermore, it retains the desirable double robustness property with respect to nuisance parameter estimation. We further show our method to outperform existing procedures in estimation accuracy across multiple data scenarios while varying sample size and nuisance error. Finally, we apply it to real-world data from an employment scheme, uncovering a reduced range of potential earnings improvement as participant age increases."}

However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019."}

In this study, high-quality attitude determination results obtained from star sensors and a fiber optical gyro (FOG) are treated as ground truth, and machine learning is applied to coarse attitude sensor data consisting of Sun sensors and magnetic field sensors.

Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently.

However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/γ\\approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes.

The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition remains second order across the entire interaction range, whereas the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic boundary shows a richer behavior, including both first- and second-order transitions as well as tricriticality. Increasing the second-neighbor coupling $J_2/J_1$ narrows the range of $J_3/J_1$ where first-order antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur; beyond a certain threshold, only second-order order-disorder transitions persist.

Here we study diffusion on a rugged energy landscape in the presence of dynamic disorder, a situation relevant to a wide range of disordered systems, including glasses, disordered solids, and biomolecular transport. For static (quenched) Gaussian disorder, Zwanzig derived a compact mean field expression for the diffusion constant, showing that increasing ruggedness leads to a sharp reduction of diffusive transport. Subsequent work demonstrated that in one-dimensional discrete lattices diffusion is further suppressed by rare but long-lived multi-site traps that lie beyond the mean-field description. In many physical systems, however, the local energy landscape is not frozen but fluctuates in time, there by modifying trap lifetimes and transport properties. In this work we develop a minimal, analytically tractable theory of diffusion on rugged energy landscapes with dynamic disorder by allowing site or barrier energies to fluctuate as dichotomic (telegraph) processes with given amplitude and flipping rate. Using a Kehr type formulation appropriate for discrete hopping processes, we derive an analytic expression for the diffusion constant in terms of mean waiting times. We show that dynamic disorder induces a continuous crossover from quasi-quenched, trap-dominated transport to an annealed, motional narrowing regime as the fluctuation rate increases. Explicit numerical calculations confirm this crossover, interpolating between rare-event-dominated diffusion and Zwanzig mean-field regime."}

When survey data are used, Small Area Estimation (SAE) methods can improve precision by borrowing strength across domains. In many applications, however, outcomes are self-reported and affected by coarsening mechanisms, such as rounding and digit preference, that reduce data resolution and may bias inference. This paper addresses both issues by developing a Bayesian unit-level SAE framework for semi-continuous, coarsened responses. Motivated by the 2019 Italian European Health Interview Survey, we estimate smoking indicators for domains defined by the cross-classification of Italian regions and age groups, capturing both smoking prevalence and intensity. The model adopts a two-part structure: a logistic component for smoking prevalence and a flexible mixture of Lognormal distributions for average cigarette consumption, coupled with an explicit model for coarsening and topcoding. Simulation studies show that ignoring coarsening can yield biased and unstable domain estimates with poor interval coverage, whereas the proposed model improves accuracy and achieves near-nominal coverage. The empirical application provides a detailed picture of smoking patterns across region-age domains, helping to characterize the dynamics of the phenomenon and inform targeted public health policies."}

A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure."}

We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures. Additionally, our CBC still performs among the most successful methods, showing less dependence on the different bond dimensions of the operator."}

The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition remains second order across the entire interaction range, whereas the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic boundary shows a richer behavior, including both first- and second-order transitions as well as tricriticality. Increasing the second-neighbor coupling $J_2/J_1$ narrows the range of $J_3/J_1$ where first-order antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur; beyond a certain threshold, only second-order order-disorder transitions persist.

Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms."}

The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can provide deterministic beam control and offer a scalable alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor links."}

However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations.

Traditional local regression models, such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale GWR (MGWR), quantify spatial relationships solely through geographic proximity. In an era of globalization and digital connectivity, however, geographic proximity alone may be insufficient to capture how locations are interconnected. To address this limitation, we propose a new multiscale local regression framework, termed M-SGWR, which characterizes spatial interaction across two dimensions: geographic proximity and attribute (variable) similarity. For each predictor, geographic and attribute-based weight matrices are constructed separately and then combined using an optimized parameter, alpha, which governs their relative contribution to local model fitting. Analogous to variable-specific bandwidths in MGWR, the optimal alpha varies by predictor, allowing the model to flexibly account for geographic, mixed, or non-spatial (remote similarity) effects. Results from two simulation experiments and one empirical application demonstrate that M-SGWR consistently outperforms GWR, SGWR, and MGWR across all goodness-of-fit metrics."}

The formulation derives boundary integral equations from the Stratton-Chu representation for the azimuthal component of the vector potential in both air and conductive regions. The central contribution is a unified regularization framework for the two-dimensional (2D) singular integrals arising in Galerkin BEM. This framework handles both logarithmic and Cauchy singularities through a common set of integral transformations, eliminating the need for case-by-case analytical singularity extraction and enabling straightforward numerical quadrature. The regularization and quadrature stability are proved and verified numerically. The method is validated on several representative axisymmetric geometries, including cylindrical, conical, and spherical shells. Numerical experiments demonstrate consistently high accuracy and computational efficiency across broad frequency ranges and coil lift-off distances. The results confirm that the proposed axisymmetric Galerkin BEM, combined with the integral transformation technique, provides a robust and efficient framework for axisymmetric eddy-current nondestructive evaluation."}

A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure."}

Recently, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC) has emerged as a promising estimand, offering quantile-level summaries akin to the conditional quantile treatment effect (CQTE) while preserving some interpretability of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). It achieves this by summarising the treated response conditional on both the covariates and the untreated response. Despite these desirable properties, the CQC's current estimation is limited by the need to first estimate the difference in conditional cumulative distribution functions and then invert it. This inversion obscures the CQC estimate, hampering our ability to both model and interpret it. To address this, we propose the first direct estimator of the CQC, allowing for explicit modelling and parameterisation. This explicit parameterisation enables better interpretation of our estimate while also providing a means to constrain and inform the model. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that our estimation error depends directly on the complexity of the CQC itself, improving upon the existing estimation procedure. Furthermore, it retains the desirable double robustness property with respect to nuisance parameter estimation. We further show our method to outperform existing procedures in estimation accuracy across multiple data scenarios while varying sample size and nuisance error. Finally, we apply it to real-world data from an employment scheme, uncovering a reduced range of potential earnings improvement as participant age increases."}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of ``Green-representable solutions'' utilizing test functions constructed from fundamental solutions. This framework enables a new formulation of sub- and super-solutions that permits rigorous pointwise evaluation. For one-dimensional problems, we derive explicit constructions of the test functions. For two-dimensional polygonal domains, we employ the Method of Fundamental Solutions to generate test functions.

Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms."}

Whether or not this works depends on the definition of adjacency and we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee its success. The resulting generic algorithm is an alternative to dichotomic search in our setting.\n  We then apply our generic algorithm to a specific example: the bi-objective minimum weight basis problem, in which we are given a matroid and want to find bases of minimum weight. We use the natural definition of adjacency, in which two bases are adjacent if they differ in exactly one element. Since this satisfies our sufficient condition on the adjacency relation, our generic algorithm works in this case and we analyse its running time, showing that it is polynomial. By tailoring this algorithm specifically to matroids, we obtain one that is faster but no longer transitions between adjacent solutions, instead swapping directly from one extreme-supported point to the next in a combinatorial fashion."}

In local spin systems the ground-state and anti-ground-state phases approach the middle of the spectrum as $1/[\\text{system size}]$, but -- because the condensation phase transitions have exponential, rather than polynomial, finite-size scaling -- the crossover becomes exponentially sharp in system size and the high-temperature phase is best understood as an extended phase."}

Training-free diffusion models provide an attractive alternative by exploiting analytically tractable score functions, and have recently enabled supervised learning of efficient end-to-end generative samplers. Despite their empirical success, the training-free diffusion models lack rigorous and numerically verifiable error estimates. In this work, we develop a comprehensive error analysis for a class of training-free diffusion models used to generate labeled data for supervised learning of generative samplers. By exploiting the availability of the exact score function for Gaussian mixture models, our analysis avoids propagating score-function approximation errors through the reverse-time diffusion process and recovers classical convergence rates for ODE discretization schemes, such as first-order convergence for the Euler method.

We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives.

Addressing these challenges requires optimization frameworks that can jointly determine optimal crop allocation, groundwater pumping, and environmental flow releases while maintaining economic and hydrological feasibility. However, existing hydro-economic models, including the widely used Lewis and Randall formulation, may overestimate net benefits by allowing infeasible negative pumping and surface water allocations. We extend the Lewis and Randall framework by reformulating groundwater pumping and surface water use as non-negative, demand-driven decision variables and by explicitly incorporating environmental flow and canal capacity constraints. Three models are developed to maximize economic benefit, minimize environmental deficits, and a multiobjective model that evaluates the trade-offs between these two objectives. An illustrative test case examining optimal crop area allocation and environmental flow management across dry, average, and wet years, using data from the Rajshahi Barind Tract in northwestern Bangladesh, is presented. The results show that the proposed formulation produces economically and hydrologically consistent solutions, identifying optimal strategies when either net benefits or environmental protection is prioritized, as well as Pareto-optimal trade-offs when both objectives are considered together. These findings provide practical insights for balancing farm income, groundwater sustainability, and ecological protection, offering a robust decision-support tool for irrigation management in water-limited river basins."}

A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure."}

Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \\emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method.

Inspired by these important research achievements, a conceptually simple approach is proposed to facilitate reliable and efficient numerical simulations. The structure of the underlying systems of coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equations suggests the use of optimised high-order operator splitting methods for dynamical evolution and ground state computation. A second-order barrier, however, prevents the applicability of standard operator splitting methods for both, time evolution as well as imaginary time propagation. An innovative alternative approach accomplishes the design of novel modified operator splitting methods that remain stable under moderate smallness assumptions on the time increments. The core idea is to incorporate commutators of the defining differential and nonlinear multiplication operators, since this permits to fulfill the basic stability requirement of positive method coefficients. Further improvements with respect to convergence at the targeted precision arise from automatic adjustments of the time stepsizes by an inexpensive local error control. The presented numerical experiments confirm the favourable performance of a specific fourth-order modified operator splitting method. Amongst others, it is demonstrated that the excellent mass and energy conservation in long-term evolutions, intrinsic attributes of geometric numerical integrators for Hamiltonian systems, is maintained for a sensible variation of the time stepsizes. Moreover, the benefits of adaptive higher-order approximations in ground state computations are illustrated."}

However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples."}

These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility.

Our results on single-patch homogeneous and multi-patch heterogeneous problems, including a cruciform-shaped fuel array inspired by advanced reactor fuel designs, demonstrate the TT format's ability to compress interior operators from petabytes to megabytes, whereas the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix format requires gigabytes of storage. However, highly coupled boundary operators present a significant challenge for TT. Despite the storage savings, TT formatted operators increase time-to-solution relative to CSR as an uncompressed solution vector forces operator-vector product scaling of $O(dr^2N^d\\log(N))$ for TT while CSR scales at $O(\\text{nnz})$. We mitigate this discrepancy by using mixed formats with interior operators in TT, while high-rank boundary operators remain in CSR format.

On the quantum side, we employ a fractional (Caputo) extension of a two-state dissipative model embedded by thermo-field dynamics (TFD), yielding a closed-form intrinsic entanglement component $b^{(α)}_{qe}(t)=\\frac14[E_α(-λ^αt^α)]^2\\sin^2(ωt)$ and an integrated revival measure $N_{qe}$ that delineates a sharp boundary near $α\\simeq 1/2$ in the $(α,ω/λ)$ plane. On the classical side, we consider a three-state model whose Markov generator is promoted either to an exponential-kernel generalized master equation (with exact Markov embedding) or to a semi-Markov process with Erlang-2 waiting times. We quantify non-monotonicity by the entropy overshoot $ΔH$ and KL-based diagnostics on the probability simplex.

Overall, our results provide a compact, model-agnostic route to classify non-Markovianity by phase diagrams of information backflow and to interpret them via a shared embedding narrative: memory stored in hidden degrees of freedom returns to the observed sector as non-monotonic information flow."}

This change of mathematical type constitutes the core of the 'cut': a structurally necessary interface from group-based kinematics to set-based counting. In the presented view the basis relevant for recorded outcomes is not determined by the system Hamiltonian alone; it is induced by the measurement mapping, i.e., by the detector channel together with the coarse-grained readout that defines an instrument. The probabilistic mapping is anchored in symmetry and measure theory: by Gleason-type uniqueness (Gleason for projections in $d>2$ and Busch's extension for Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) including $d=2$), the trace rule is the unique probability measure consistent with additivity over exclusive events and basis-independence of the unitary sector. A compact qubit--pointer model yields an induced unsharp POVM $E_\\pm=\\tfrac12(\\id\\pm η\\,σ_z)$ with $η$ fixed by pointer resolution, displaying explicitly how the detector induces the relevant basis.

The chief advantage of these codes is that they possess metachecks and high confinement that permit complete single-shot decoding, while also having additional algebraic structure that might enable logical non-Clifford gates. We offer a framework that facilitates the construction of long-length chain complexes through the use of Koszul complex. In particular, obtaining explicit boundary maps (parity check and metacheck matrices) is particularly straightforward in our approach. This simple but very general parameterization of codes permitted us to efficiently perform a numerical search, where we identify several MM code candidates that demonstrate these capabilities at high rates and high code distances. Examples of new codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ include $[[96, 12, 8]]$, $[[96, 44, 4]]$ $[[144, 40, 4]]$, $[[216, 12, 12]]$, $[[360, 30, 6]]$, $[[384, 80, 4]]$, $[[486, 24, 12]]$, $[[486, 66, 9]]$ and $[[648, 60, 9]]$.

These effects are described by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian, which extends the nonrelativistic electronic Hamiltonian by including one- and two-electron spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions. First-principles simulations of the full Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian rapidly become intractable on classical computers due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the complexity of two-body spin-dependent terms. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing molecular energy levels and properties governed by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian. Our approach block-encodes the relativistic Hamiltonian in a second-quantized, doubly factorized representation. By reformulating the Hamiltonian in a symmetry-adapted Majorana basis, we construct efficient linear-combination-of-unitaries circuits that encode spin-orbit interactions without effective or mean-field approximations. We introduce spin-controlled Pauli-SWAP networks that decouple spin and orbital control logic, enabling a unified treatment of relativistic spin mixing with only modest overhead relative to spin-free simulations. We analyze quantum resources in terms of logical qubits and T-gate complexity, showing that explicit spin degrees of freedom do not worsen the asymptotic scaling.

Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range.

We formulate Krylov complexity in geometric terms, both instantaneously and in a time-averaged sense, and contrast it with an IG complexity of quantum evolutions characterized in terms of efficiency and curvature. We show that the two measures reflect fundamentally different aspects of quantum dynamics: Krylov's state complexity quantifies the directional spread of the evolving state relative to the initial state, whereas the IG complexity captures the effective volume explored along the trajectory on the Bloch sphere. This geometric distinction explains their inequivalent behavior and highlights the complementary nature of state-based and information-geometric notions of complexity in quantum systems."}

Readout fidelity is typically limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and energy relaxation ($T_1$ decay), a significant problem for superconducting qubits.

We instead propose using machine learning (ML) on the raw, non-integrated analog signal. We apply time-series classification models, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to the full data trajectory. We find that our LSTM model, combined with filtering and feature engineering, consistently outperforms clustering. The largest improvements come from reclassifying points in the boundary regions between clusters. These points correspond to atypical measurement records, likely due to transient or noisy features lost during data integration. By retaining temporal information, sequence-aware models like LSTMs can better discriminate these trajectories, whereas clustering methods based on integrated values are more prone to misclassification."}

While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers.

During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder. The simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement with the corresponding classical solutions.

In particular, the $(n, n-1)$-QRACs, which encode $n$ bits of classical information into $n-1$ qubits, provides an ideal theoretical model for verifying quantum advantage in high-dimensional spaces; however, the analytical derivation of optimal codes for general $n$ has remained an open problem.

For fluxonium qubits with realistic noise spectra, our method enhances $T_φ$ by a factor of 3-5 compared with existing DSS strategies while maintaining $T_1$ in the hundred-microsecond range.

The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~μ$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system.

We present DynQ, the first dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that virtualises quantum hardware using quality-weighted community detection. Instead of imposing fixed geometric regions, DynQ models a quantum processor as a weighted graph derived from live calibration data and automatically discovers execution regions that maximise internal gate quality while minimising inter-region coupling. This operationalises the classical virtualisation principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing execution regions that are connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient to crosstalk and defects. We evaluate DynQ across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, comparing against state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines. On hardware with pronounced spatial quality variation, DynQ achieves up to 19.1 percent higher fidelity and 45.1 percent lower output error.

Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently. Photonic neural networks are particularly well suited for such implementations, owing to their intrinsic sensitivity to photon-encoded quantum information. However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/γ\\approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes. By reducing reliance on material nonlinearity and reservoir size, the proposed approach facilitates the practical deployment of high-fidelity photonic quantum sensors on existing integrated platforms, paving the way toward chip-scale quantum processors and photonic sensing technologies."}

Phys", "summary": "We develop and analyze a two-oscillator model for black hole evaporation in which an effective geometric degree of freedom and a representative Hawking radiation mode are described by coupled harmonic oscillators with opposite signs in their free Hamiltonians. The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\\langle n_x\\rangle - \\langle n_y\\rangle$. The reduced entropy $S_x(t)$ exhibits periodic growth, indicating entanglement generation. These results demonstrate that even a minimal two-mode framework can capture key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation."}

In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \\textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis. Experimental results of our proposed strategy, applied on top of well-known synthesis algorithms, show up to a $20\\%$ reduction in $T$-count on circuits with up to 25 qubits, without introducing any additional approximation error prior to synthesis."}

In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction. Overall, our results suggest that quantum error correction can be viewed as a universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry."}

Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\\rm GL}(N,{\\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\\rm GL}(N,{\\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians."}

We explore scenarios in which the error probability for discriminating two quantum states can be reduced below the Helstrom bound under some constrained access of resources, indicating the use of measurement operations that go beyond the standard positive operator-valued measurements framework. We refer to such measurements as non-positive operator-valued measurements. While existing literature often associates these measurements with initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary, followed by joint projective measurement and discarding the auxiliary, we demonstrate that initial entanglement between system and auxiliary is not necessary for the emergence of such measurements in the context of state discrimination. Interestingly, even initial product states can give rise to effective non-positive measurements on the subsystem, and achieve sub-Helstrom discrimination error when discriminating quantum states of the subsystem."}

Building on recent advances in quantum error correction, we show that this architecture enables the native implementation of folded surface codes on 2D hardware, reducing the runtime of all single-qubit logical Clifford gates and logical CNOTs within subsets of qubits from $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ in conventional surface code lattice surgery to constant time. We present explicit protocols for these operations and demonstrate that access to a transversal $S$ gate reduces the spacetime volume of 8T-to-CCZ magic-state distillation by more than an order of magnitude compared with standard 2D lattice surgery approaches.

We first prove that calculating the optimal code weight is an $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard problem, demonstrating the necessity of establishing bounds for weight that are analytical or efficiently computable. Then we systematically investigate the feasible code parameters with weight constraints. We provide various explicit analytical lower bounds and in particular completely characterize stabilizer codes with weight at most 3, showing that they have distance 2 and code rate at most 1/4. We also develop a powerful linear programming (LP) scheme for setting code parameter bounds with weight constraints, which yields exact optimal weight values for all code parameters with $n\\leq 9$. We further refined this constraint from multiple perspectives by considering the generator weight distribution and overlap. In particular, we consider practical architectures and demonstrate how to apply our methods to e.g.~the IBM 127-qubit chip.

We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Distinct monitoring or intervention schemes can produce different conditioned stochastic quantum trajectories while sharing the same unconditional (ensemble-averaged) dynamics. This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by the unconditional density matrix, whereas applying a nonlinear function before averaging can yield unraveling-dependent results beyond the average evolution. A paradigmatic example is resonance fluorescence, where direct photodetection (jump/Poisson) and homodyne or heterodyne detection (diffusive/Wiener) define inequivalent unravelings of the same GKSL dynamics. In earlier work, we showed that nonlinear trajectory averages can distinguish such unravelings, but observing the effect in that optical setting requires demanding experimental precision. Here we translate the same idea to a digital setting by introducing synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits acting on one and two qubits. We design two unravelings - a projective measurement unraveling and a random-unitary \"kick\" unraveling - that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution while yielding different nonlinear conditional-state statistics. We implement the protocols on superconducting-qubit hardware provided by IBM Quantum to access trajectory-level information. We show that the variance across trajectories and the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy distinguish the unravelings in both theory and experiment, while the unconditional state and the ensemble-averaged expectation values that are linear in the state remain identical. Our results provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is fixed by the unconditional dynamics."}

The coupling strength is controlled by an intercoupling parameter $w$, with $w=0$ corresponding to decoupled quantum Ising systems. We focus on the quantum correlations of one of the two SQI subsystems, $S$, in the ground state of the global system, and study their dependence on both the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part $E$ and the intercoupling strength. We concentrate on regimes in which $S$ develops critical long-range correlations. The most interesting physical scenario arises when both SQI subsystems are critical. In particular, for identical SQI subsystems, the global system is equivalent to the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, characterized by an additional $Z_2$ interchange symmetry between the two subsystem operators. In this limit, one-dimensional SQI systems exhibit a peculiar critical line along which the length-scale critical exponent $ν$ varies continuously with $w$, while two-dimensional systems develop quantum multicritical behaviors characterized by an effective enlargement of the symmetry of the critical modes, from the actual $Z_2\\oplus Z_2$ symmetry to a continuous O(2) symmetry."}

We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics."}
