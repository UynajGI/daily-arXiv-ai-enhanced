Existing projection methods rely on sorting and therefore incur an initial O(nlogn) complexity, which limits their scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this difficulty, we revisit the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the projection problem and introduce relaxed conditions that remain sufficient for characterizing the solution. These conditions lead to a simple geometric interpretation: finding the solutions is equivalent to locating the intersection of two monotone piecewise linear functions. Building on this insight, we propose an iterative and highly efficient algorithm that searches directly for the intersection point and completely avoids all sorting procedures. We prove that the algorithm converges globally and reaches the exact solution in a finite number of iterations. Extensive numerical experiments further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing algorithms and exhibits empirical O(n) complexity across a broad range of problem instances."}

The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead. Therefore, effective inference/post-processing of the obtained super-resolved solution is possible. Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability.

It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics.

To address these challenges, we propose PhysGTO, an efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for learning physical dynamics through explicit manifold embeddings in both physical and latent spaces. In the physical space, the proposed Unified Graph Embedding module aligns node-level conditions and constructs sparse yet structure-preserving graph connectivity to process heterogeneous inputs. In the latent space, PhysGTO integrates a lightweight flux-oriented message-passing scheme with projection-inspired attention to capture local and global dependencies, facilitating multilevel interactions among complex physical correlations. This design ensures linear complexity relative to the number of mesh points, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and computational costs in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), and thereby allowing efficient inference in real-time applications. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning eleven datasets, covering problems with unstructured meshes, transient flow dynamics, and large-scale 3D geometries.

To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight enhancement: for each node, we append two classical graph-theoretic metrics, degree centrality and local clustering coefficient, to its original BERT and profile embeddings, thus explicitly flagging the roles of hub and community. In the UPFD Politifact subset, this simple modification boosts macro F1 from 0.7753 to 0.8344 over the original baseline.

Machine learning (ML) methods offer increased inference speed and flexibility in capturing prior knowledge of imaging targets relative to classical optimization-based approaches; however, they perform poorly in regimes where the scattering behavior is highly nonlinear. A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model. The proposed method progressively refines reconstructions of the scattering potential using measurements at increasing wave frequencies, following a classical strategy to stabilize recovery.

In dry regions, convection lags the circulation by nearly a quarter cycle, whereas in very moist regions it becomes nearly in-phase and extends across the QBWO gyre. As the background moistens, moisture anomalies increasingly align with the QBWO circulation. Despite differences in environmental moisture and wind conditions, several structural features remain robust: outgoing longwave radiation and moisture anomalies stay collocated, moisture and pressure-velocity anomalies remain vertically upright, and the filtered winds retain a first-baroclinic mode structure. A vorticity budget shows that, although the planetary vorticity-gradient term is important, both planetary stretching and horizontal advection are needed to explain the vorticity tendency- and their relative importance shifts with the moisture regime. In dry and moderately moist regions with easterly mean flow, mean winds primarily advect vorticity anomalies. In contrast, in very moist regions with westerly flow, anomalous winds instead advect the background vorticity. An analogous transition occurs in the moisture budget: in dry and moderately moist environments, zonal mean flow advection dominates, but in very moist regions, strong background moisture gradients allow eddy advection of the mean moisture field to become the leading term. In the moist regime, vertical advection, precipitation, and evaporation also contribute substantially to the moisture tendency. Overall, the QBWO behaves like a mean-flow-driven linear mode in dry and moderately moist regions with easterly background winds, but shifts toward a regime dominated by eddy advection of background vorticity and moisture in very moist regions characterized by westerly flow."}

One of unsolved problems in Nambu dynamics has been to extend it to interacting systems without violating a generalized canonical structure associated with the presence of multiple Hamiltonians, which together govern the dynamics of time evolution with an equal footing. In the present paper, we propose to include interactions from the standpoint of classical statistical dynamics by formulating it as a field theory on Nambu's generalized phase space in an operator formalism. We first construct a general framework for such a field theory and its probabilistic interpretation. Then, on the basis of this new framework, we give a simple model of self-interaction in a many-body Nambu system treated as a closed dynamical system satisfying the H-theorem. It is shown that a generalized micro-canonical ensemble and a generalized canonical ensemble characterized by many temperatures are reached dynamically as equilibrium states, starting with certain classes of initial non-equilibrium states via continuous Markov processes. Compared with the usual classical statistical mechanics on the basis of standard Hamiltonian dynamics, some important new features associated with Nambu dynamics will emerge, with respect to the symmetries underlying dynamics of the non-equilibrium as well as the equilibrium states and also to some conceptual properties, such as a formulation of a generalized KMS-like condition characterizing the generalized canonical equilibrium states and a `relative' nature of the temperatures."}

We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources."}

High-mix discrete manufacturing systems require jointly optimizing mid-term production planning and machine-level scheduling under heterogeneous resources and stringent delivery commitments. We address this problem with a profit-driven integrated framework that couples a mixed-integer planning model with a machine-level scheduling heuristic. The planning layer allocates production, accessory co-production, and outsourcing under aggregate economic and capacity constraints, while the scheduling layer refines these allocations using a structure-aware procedure that enforces execution feasibility and stabilizes daily machine behavior. This hierarchical design preserves the tractability of aggregated optimization while capturing detailed operational restrictions. Evaluations are conducted on a real industrial scenario. A flexible machine-level execution scheme yields 73.3% on-time completion and significant outsourcing demand, revealing bottleneck congestion. In contrast, a stability-enforcing execution policy achieves 100% on-time completion, eliminates all outsourcing, and maintains balanced machine utilization with only 1.9 to 4.6% capacity loss from changeovers. These results show that aligning planning decisions with stability-oriented execution rules enables practical and interpretable profit-maximizing decisions in complex manufacturing environments."}

The port of Ciutadella (Menorca), is a recognized hotspot for meteotsunami occurrence. This study presents a 50-year analysis of 191 meteotsunami events recorded in Ciutadella between 1975 and 2025, focusing on the distinction between the convective and non-convective nature of the pressure disturbances that triggered the meteotsunami event and their implications for predictability and risk assessment. Events were classified using historical records, in-situ barographic and sea-level observations, satellite imagery, and lightning data. Results show that non-convective meteotsunamis are typically triggered by internal gravity waves, producing relatively regular and moderate pressure fluctuations. In contrast, convective events are associated with abrupt pressure jumps and tend to produce the most extreme sea-level oscillations, exceeding 3-4 meters in some cases, such as the catastrophic events of June 1984 and June 2006. Forecasting skill varied by event type: A full-realistic high-resolution ocean-atmosphere modelling system (BRIFS) performed better for convective cases, whereas a targeted reduced-physics method (TRAM) was more accurate for non-convective scenarios. This study provides the most extensive meteotsunami dataset for the Balearic Islands to date and offers a novel framework for understanding the contrasting dynamics and characteristics of both types of events. The results support the development of improved early-warning systems and more effective coastal risk mitigation strategies in vulnerable regions."}

Despite strong theoretical interest, its experimental observation in the FQH state has remained elusive, making it a promising target for realization on current NISQ devices. In this work, we employ a quasi-one-dimensional model of an FQH state coupled to a background metric to probe the geometric response under a metric quench. We design and implement a quantum-circuit protocol that realizes a Hilbert-space-truncated version of the model and extracts the Hall viscosity from the geometric response encoded in the wavefunction dynamics of the device. While the truncation prevents us from accessing the fully quantized value of Hall viscosity, the hardware data nevertheless show excellent agreement with analytical and numerical predictions within this restricted regime."}

Analytically, we derive conditions for the stability of endemic and disease-free equilibria. Numerical simulations reveal complex dynamics: above a certain infectivity threshold, the system can exhibit alternative basins of attraction leading to a balanced endemic fixed point or stable limit cycles. Notably, the dominant asymptotic opinion and resulting epidemiological outcomes show non-monotonic relationships with infectivity, highlighting the potential for adaptive behavior to induce complex system dynamics. These findings underscore the critical role of social interventions; shifts in behavioral norms and trust can permanently alter epidemic outcomes, suggesting that such interventions are as crucial as biomedical controls"}

Although CBF-based safety filters are often implemented by solving a quadratic program (QP) in real time, the use of off-the-shelf solvers for such optimization problems poses a challenge in applications where control actions need to be computed efficiently at very high frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form expression for controllers obtained through CBF-based safety filters. This expression is obtained by partitioning the state-space into different regions, with a different closed-form solution in each region. We leverage this formula to introduce a resource-aware implementation of CBF-based safety filters that detects changes in the partition region and uses the closed-form expression between changes. We showcase the applicability of our approach in examples ranging from aerospace control to safe reinforcement learning."}

Empirically, reducing the number of significant bits through rounding often leads to instances that are easier to solve. One reason can be that the amount of symmetries increases, which enables solvers to be more effective when they are exploited. This can signify that the original instance contains 'almost symmetries'. Furthermore, solving the rounded problems provides approximations to the original objective values. We empirically investigate these relations on instances of the capacitated facility location problem, the knapsack problem and a diverse collection of additional instances, using the solvers SCIP and CP-SAT. For all investigated problem classes, we show empirically that this yields faster algorithms with guaranteed solution quality. The influence of symmetry depends on the instance type and solver."}

We demonstrate that such acceleration can be universally achieved via transient stochastic resetting. This means that during an initial time interval of finite duration, the dynamics is interrupted by resets that take the system to a designated state at randomly selected times. We illustrate this idea for few-body open systems and also for a challenging many-body case, where a first-order phase transition leads to a divergence of relaxation time. In all scenarios, a significant and sometimes even exponential acceleration in reaching the stationary state is observed, similar to the so-called Mpemba effect. The universal nature of this speedup lies in the fact that the design of the resetting protocol only requires knowledge of a few macroscopic properties of the target state, such as the order parameter of the phase transition, while it does not necessitate any fine-tuned manipulation of the initial state."}

Given a probability measure $μ$ on a space $E$ and a diffeomorphism $ψ: E \\to F$, concentration properties transfer covariantly: if the pushforward $ψ_*μ$ concentrates, so does $μ$ in the pullback geometry. This reveals that classical concentration inequalities -- Hoeffding, Bernstein, Talagrand, Gaussian isoperimetry -- are manifestations of a single principle of \\emph{geometric invariance}. The choice of coordinate system $ψ$ becomes a free parameter that can be optimized. We prove that for any distribution class $\\Pc$, there exists an optimal diffeomorphism $ψ^*$ minimizing the concentration constant, and we characterize $ψ^*$ in terms of the Fisher-Rao geometry of $\\Pc$.

Our framework integrates four interrelated sub-modules: (i) the operational behavior of representative ride-hailing Mixed-Fleet Traffic Network Companies (MiFleet TNCs) managing autonomous vehicle (AV) and human-driven vehicle (HV) fleets, (ii) traveler mode-choice decisions taking into account travel costs and waiting time, (iii) capped customer waiting times to reflect the option available to travelers not to wait for TNCs' service beyond his/her patience and to resort to existing travel modes, and (iv) a flow-dependent traffic congestion model for travel times. A key modeling feature distinguishes AVs and HVs across the pickup and service (customer-on-board) stages: AVs follow Wardrop pickup routes but may deviate during service under company coordination, whereas HVs operate in the reverse manner. The overall framework is formulated as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP), which is equivalent to a Variational Inequality(VI) formulation based on which the existence of a variational equilibrium solution to the traffic model is established. Numerical experiments examine how AV penetration and Wardrop relaxation factors, which bound route deviation, affect company, traveler, and system performance to various degrees. The results provide actionable insights for policymakers on regulating AV adoption and company vehicle deviation behavior in modern-day traffic systems that are fast changing due to the advances in technology and information accessibility."}

Existing approaches often treat crop interactions, such as legume-cereal complementarity, which implicitly or rely on static deterministic formulations that fail to guarantee resilience against market and climate volatility. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Layer Robust Crop Planning Framework (MLRCPF) that integrates spatial reasoning, temporal dynamics, and robust optimization. Specifically, we formalize crop-to-crop relationships through a structured interaction matrix embedded within the state-transition logic, and employ a distributionally robust optimization layer to mitigate worst-case risks defined by a data-driven ambiguity set. Evaluations on a real-world high-mix farming dataset from North China demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The framework autonomously generates sustainable checkerboard rotation patterns that restore soil fertility, significantly increasing the legume planting ratio compared to deterministic baselines. Economically, it successfully resolves the trade-off between optimality and stability. These results highlight the importance of explicitly encoding domain-specific structural priors into optimization models for resilient decision-making in complex agricultural systems."}

Previous research has often examined text or users in isolation, overlooking the structural context in which such toxic interactions occur. Without considering who interacts with whom and around what content, it is difficult to explain why negative expressions cluster within particular communities. To address this issue, this study focuses on the Chinese social video platform Bilibili, incorporating video-level information as the environment for user expression, modeling users and videos in an interaction matrix. After normalization and dimensionality reduction, we perform separate clustering on both sides of the video-user interaction matrix with K-means. Cluster assignments facilitate comparisons of user behavior, including message length, posting frequency, and source (barrage and comment), as well as textual features such as sentiment and toxicity, and video attributes defined by uploaders. Such a clustering approach integrates structural ties with content signals to identify stable groups of videos and users. We find clear stratification in interaction style (message length, comment ratio) across user clusters, while sentiment and toxicity differences are weak or inconsistent across video clusters. Across video clusters, viewing volume exhibits a clear hierarchy, with higher exposure groups concentrating more toxic expressions. For such a group, platforms should require timely intervention during periods of rapid growth. Across user clusters, comment ratio and message length form distinct hierarchies, and several clusters with longer and comment-oriented messages exhibit lower toxicity. For such groups, platforms should strengthen mechanisms that sustain rational dialogue and encourage engagement across topics."}

However, from the perspective of forming a macroscopic flow pattern optimized for heat-exchange efficiency, a uniform lattice is not necessarily the optimal configuration. This study initially presents a macroscopic modeling approach for a two-fluid heat exchanger equipped with a TPMS Primitive lattice. The macroscopic flow analysis is conducted based on the Darcy--Forchheimer theory. Under the assumption that heat is transferred solely at the interface between the fluid and the TPMS walls, a macroscopic heat-transfer model is developed using a volumetric heat-transfer coefficient, which serves as an artificial property characterizing the unit-volume heat-transfer capability. To regulate the relative dominance of the hot and cold flows-effectively, the channel widths-within the heat exchanger, we adopt the isosurface threshold of the Primitive lattice as the design variable and construct an optimization scheme for the lattice distribution using the previously described macroscopic model. The optimization is subsequently carried out for a planar heat exchanger where the hot and cold fluids each follow U-shaped flow trajectories. The optimal solution was verified, and its validity was examined through detailed geometric analysis and experiments conducted using metal LPBF. The optimal solution derived from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance advantage over the uniform lattice in the experimental results. The optimal solution obtained from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance improvement over the uniform lattice, with an average enhancement of 28.7% in the experimental results."}

These constraints stem from the fact that Earth is a materially closed yet energetically open system, driven by the sustained but low power-density flux of solar radiation. This Perspective reframes sustainability within these axiomatic limits, integrating relevant timescales and orders of magnitude. We argue that fossil-fueled industrial metabolism is inherently incompatible with long-term viability, while post-fossil systems are surface-, materials-, and power-intensive. Long-term sustainability must therefore be defined not only by how much energy or material is used, but also by how it is used: favoring organic, carbon-based chemistry with limited reliance on purified metals, operating at low power density, and maintaining low throughput rates. Achieving this requires radical technological shifts toward life-compatible systems and biogeochemical circular processes, and, likely as a consequence, a paradigm change toward degrowth to a steady-state. These two shifts are mutually reinforcing and together provide the necessary foundation for any viable future."}

Our framework integrates four interrelated sub-modules: (i) the operational behavior of representative ride-hailing Mixed-Fleet Traffic Network Companies (MiFleet TNCs) managing autonomous vehicle (AV) and human-driven vehicle (HV) fleets, (ii) traveler mode-choice decisions taking into account travel costs and waiting time, (iii) capped customer waiting times to reflect the option available to travelers not to wait for TNCs' service beyond his/her patience and to resort to existing travel modes, and (iv) a flow-dependent traffic congestion model for travel times. A key modeling feature distinguishes AVs and HVs across the pickup and service (customer-on-board) stages: AVs follow Wardrop pickup routes but may deviate during service under company coordination, whereas HVs operate in the reverse manner. The overall framework is formulated as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP), which is equivalent to a Variational Inequality(VI) formulation based on which the existence of a variational equilibrium solution to the traffic model is established. Numerical experiments examine how AV penetration and Wardrop relaxation factors, which bound route deviation, affect company, traveler, and system performance to various degrees. The results provide actionable insights for policymakers on regulating AV adoption and company vehicle deviation behavior in modern-day traffic systems that are fast changing due to the advances in technology and information accessibility."}

However, existing ML applications in seismic liquefaction prediction remain fragmented: sampling strategies vary widely across studies without a unified benchmark. Moreover, these studies generally optimize the sample set configuration independently, ignoring the interaction among training set configurations. To address these limitations, this study establishes a benchmark that systematically evaluates sampling methods, training set sample sizes, train-test split ratios, class distributions, and training set configurations coupling on seven mainstream ML models performance, and further improves the predictive accuracy of seismic liquefaction-using a database of 250 historical liquefaction events, evaluated by Acc and F1. The results show that ordered systematic sampling yields the best performance across all models. The optimal model can be trained when the training set sample size is 200, the train-test split ratio is 80:20, and the class distribution range is 1-1.5. Among them, the train-test split ratio most significantly influenced performance, followed by the class distribution, with the training set sample size having the least effect. Furthermore, the Random Forest model achieves the highest performance, while the K-Nearest Neighbor model performs the weakest. Importantly, this study systematically identifies and verifies for the first time that there will be an interaction effect among training set configurations, rather than a simple additive effect. This study provides a benchmark for scholars to select the optimal sampling method and training set configurations to obtain high accuracy in ML-based liquefaction prediction."}

In this work, we introduce an improved method to determine this dimension by analyzing the angles between tangent subspaces spanned by the CLVs. This approach builds upon a fast numerical technique for assessing chaotic dynamics hyperbolicity. Crucially, the proposed method requires significantly less computational effort and minimizes memory usage by eliminating the need for explicit CLV computation. We test our method on two canonical systems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a diffusively coupled chain of Lorenz oscillators. For the former, the results confirm the accuracy of the new approach by matching prior dimension estimates. For the latter, the analysis demonstrates the absence of a low-dimensional inertial manifold, highlighting a complex regime that merits further investigation. The presented method offers a practical and efficient tool for characterizing high-dimensional attractors in extended dynamical systems."}

A blind application of the Harris criterion would suggest that this criticality is lost in the presence of the disorder. It turns out not to be the case. For the disorder affecting ladder's rung hoppings only, we have found that the transitions survive disappearing only for quite strong disorder. The disorder in the ladder's legs destroys the nonzero mass phase criticality, while the symmetry-protected topological phase for zero mass survives a small disorder. The observed robustness against disorder is explained qualitatively using field-theoretic arguments."}

We introduce metric-driven methods for such problems via Riemannian gradient techniques, leveraging the idea that gradients can be represented in different metrics (so-called Sobolev gradients) to accelerate convergence. We show that the choice of metric not only leads to specific metric-driven iterative schemes, but also induces approximation spaces with enhanced properties, particularly in low-regularity regimes or when the solution exhibits heterogeneous multiscale features. In fact, we recover a well-known class of multiscale spaces based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD), now derived from a new perspective.

These departures--termed quantumness here--power quantum information and computation. This thesis charts the role of discrete structures in assessing quantumness, synthesizing elements of my postdoctoral research through this lens. After an introduction to the necessary background concepts, I present my work under three broad categories. First, I present work on contextuality that extensively relies on (undirected) graphs and hypergraphs as the discrete structures of interest; more specifically, it relies on invariants associated with them. This work includes Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and its operationalization to generalized contextuality, expressed via (hyper)graph-theoretic frameworks. I also present work on KS-contextuality in multiqubit systems and an application of generalized contextuality to a one-shot communication task, both of which rely on hypergraphs. Second, I present work on causality, where the discrete structures of interest are directed graphs. This includes work on indefinite causal order, specifically its connections to the gap between local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations (SEP), and a device-independent notion of nonclassicality--termed antinomicity--that generalizes Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions. Finally, I present work on the incompatibility of quantum measurements, its connection to Bell nonlocality, and its role in discriminating between quantum and almost quantum correlations in the single-system setting. The discrete structures of interest here are hypergraphs that model joint measurability relations between quantum measurements. I conclude with a summary and an overview of work that is not covered in this thesis."}

Classical $r$-adaptivity optimizes vertex positions but requires solving expensive auxiliary PDEs such as the Monge-Ampère equation, while classical $h$-adaptivity modifies topology through element subdivision but suffers from expensive error indicator computation and is constrained by isotropic refinement patterns that impose accuracy ceilings. Combined $hr$-adaptive techniques naturally outperform single-modality approaches, yet inherit both computational bottlenecks and the restricted cost-accuracy trade-off. Emerging machine learning methods for adaptive mesh refinement seek to overcome these limitations, but existing approaches address $h$-adaptivity or $r$-adaptivity in isolation. We present HypeR, a deep reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes mesh relocation and refinement. HypeR casts the joint adaptation problem using tools from hypergraph neural networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Refinement is formulated as a heterogeneous multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) where element agents decide discrete refinement actions, while relocation follows an anisotropic diffusion-based policy on vertex agents with provable prevention of mesh tangling. The reward function combines local and global error reduction to promote general accuracy. Across benchmark PDEs, HypeR reduces approximation error by up to 6--10$\\times$ versus state-of-art $h$-adaptive baselines at comparable element counts, breaking through the uniform refinement accuracy ceiling that constrains subdivision-only methods. The framework produces meshes with improved shape metrics and alignment to solution anisotropy, demonstrating that jointly learned $hr$-adaptivity strategies can substantially enhance the capabilities of automated mesh generation."}

It remains unclear whether affiliation binds fans to a single channel or instead encourages movement within a portfolio that buffers exit, and how these micro level dynamics relate to meso level audience overlap. This study examines how affiliation shapes short horizon viewer trajectories and the organization of audience overlap networks by contrasting agency affiliated and independent VTubers. Using a large, multiyear, fan centered panel of VTuber live stream engagement on YouTube, we construct monthly audience overlap between creators with a similarity measure that is robust to audience size asymmetries. At the micro level, we track retention, changes in the primary creator watched (oshi), and inactivity; at the meso level, we compare structural properties of affiliation specific subgraphs and visualize viewer state transitions. The analysis identifies a pattern of loose mobility: fans tend to remain active while reallocating attention within the same affiliation type, with limited leakage across affiliation type. Network results indicate convergence in global overlap while local neighborhoods within affiliated subgraphs remain persistently denser. Flow diagrams reveal circulate and recapture dynamics that stabilize participation without relying on single channel lock in. We contribute a reusable measurement framework for VTuber live streaming that links micro level trajectories to meso level organization and informs research on creator labor, influencer marketing, and platform governance on video platforms.

We introduce a data-driven method, Coherent Source Subsampling (CSS), which selects and averages only those cross-correlation time windows that are associated with the excitation of sources in the stationary-zone. By confining the ensemble average to these coherent subsets, CSS effectively mitigates the influence of anisotropic or intermittent sources and restores causal-acausal symmetry in the retrieved Green's functions. Applications to regional-scale ambient noise datasets demonstrate that CSS boosts inter-station coherence and enhances the reliability of surface-wave dispersion measurements, providing a physically interpretable bridge between source statistics and noise correlation theory."}

These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs."}

Its success, however, is still hindered by difficulties in aligning models to experimental data. Bayesian approaches are a valuable tool to overcome these challenges, since they enable prior assumptions and observations to be combined in a principled manner that improves numerical conditioning. Here we introduce two new algorithms to the battery community, SOBER and BASQ, that greatly speed up Bayesian inference for parameterisation and model comparison. We showcase how Bayesian model selection allows us to tackle data observability, model identifiability, and data-informed model development together. We propose this approach for the search for battery models of novel materials."}

The method leverages an interplay between exploration of the energy landscape of the objective function through a system of interacting particles subject to stochasticity and exploitation of the particles' positions through the computation of a global consensus about the location of the minimizer based on the Laplace principle. In this paper, we prove strong mean square convergence of the practical numerical time-discrete CBO algorithm to the global minimizer for a rich class of objective functions. For CBO with both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion, our convergence result features conditions on the choice of the hyperparameters as well as explicit rates of convergence in the time discretization step size $Δt$ and the number of particles $N$. By interpreting the time-discrete algorithm at the continuous-time level through a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), our proof strategy combines traditional finite-time convergence theory for numerical methods applied to SDEs with careful considerations due to the fact that the CBO coefficients do not satisfy a global Lipschitz condition. To accomodate the latter, we adopt a recently proposed generalization of Sznitman's classical argument, which allows to discard an event of small probability, controllable through fine moment estimates for the particle systems."}

Despite extensive discussions on the benefits and drawbacks of remote and hybrid arrangements, the optimal number of remote days that jointly considers multiple organizational outcomes has not been empirically established. Focusing on two critical career outcomes -- turnover risk and promotion -- we examine how remote work frequency shapes employee trajectories using large-scale observational activity data from a company with over one million employees. We find that increased remote-work frequency is associated with an initial decrease and then an increase in turnover, while promotion likelihood initially rises and then declines. Accordingly, we identify approximately two remote days per week as an optimal balance -- maximizing promotion, a positive outcome for employees, while minimizing turnover, which is undesirable for organizations and may indicate negative employee experiences. These patterns vary across subgroups defined by gender, role type, and leadership status. Several notable results emerge. First, male employees derive greater promotion benefits from remote work than female employees. Second, support workers (non-core business roles) do not experience promotion gains, and the reduction in turnover at their optimal remote-work frequency is marginal compared with employees in core business roles. Third, organizational leaders face greater challenges in remote settings than individual contributors: their turnover risk increases substantially at higher remote frequencies, and their likelihood of promotion decreases as remote frequency rises. We further show that time-allocation patterns partly explain how remote-work frequency influences these career outcomes."}

Among them, topologically nontrivial spin textures, such as a magnetic skyrmion, has been extensively studied owing to the emergence of topological Hall effects induced by real-space scalar spin chirality. Contrary to this expectation, we theoretically investigate another route to enhancing the Hall response under a topologically \\textit{trivial} double-$Q$ spin textures. Despite the cancellation of the scalar spin chirality, the double-$Q$ magnetism exhibits a pronounced Hall response with a nonmonotonic dependence on the uniform magnetization, which is in stark contrast to a ferromagnetic state and a single-$Q$ spiral state. Analyzing the multi-orbital Kondo lattice model, we show that orbital hybridization induced by the double-$Q$ superstructure enhances the Berry curvature in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect. This mechanism accounts for the observed giant anomalous Hall effect in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ and GdRu$_2$Ge$_2$, thereby highlighting topologically trivial double-$Q$ spin textures as promising spintronic materials."}

A blind application of the Harris criterion would suggest that this criticality is lost in the presence of the disorder. It turns out not to be the case. For the disorder affecting ladder's rung hoppings only, we have found that the transitions survive disappearing only for quite strong disorder. The disorder in the ladder's legs destroys the nonzero mass phase criticality, while the symmetry-protected topological phase for zero mass survives a small disorder. The observed robustness against disorder is explained qualitatively using field-theoretic arguments."}

A fundamental but underexplored source of inefficiency lies in the strict binary adherence criterion that fails to account for partial adherence, thereby discarding substantial data from individuals with even minimal deviations from the target regime. We propose two novel methodologies that relax the strict inclusion rule through flexible compatibility mechanisms. Both methods provide computationally tractable alternatives that can be easily integrated into existing IPW workflows, offering more efficient approaches to DTR estimation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that both estimators preserve consistency while achieving superior finite-sample efficiency compared to standard IPW, and comprehensive simulation studies confirm improved stability.

Such systems can be represented as anisotropic limited-degree networks, in which each node forms at most q outgoing links preferentially oriented along a fixed direction. By increasing the node density sigma at fixed q, we uncover a reentrant percolation transition: a giant strongly connected component emerges, but unexpectedly disintegrates again at high densities. This counterintuitive behavior implies that adding nodes, normally expected to enhance robustness, can instead reduce mutual accessibility and weaken global connectivity. The critical behavior displays two coexisting \"faces\": random-percolation scaling along the preferred direction and directed-percolation scaling transversely, therefore we name this phenomenon Janus percolation, in analogy with the dual-faced Roman god. These findings demonstrate that anisotropy and degree limitation can jointly induce a novel reentrant connectivity with mixed universality that bridges the universality classes of random and directed percolation, providing fresh insight into how structural constraints shape connectivity and resilience in spatial networks."}

This reveals a fundamental structural advantage of temporal dynamics and highlights a novel mechanism through which switching can overcome classical obstructions to herdability. To validate these conclusions, we utilize a more relaxed form of sign matching within each snapshot of the temporal network.

We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions.

To address this question, we investigate a globally coupled network of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators that includes both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions, together with additive stochastic forcing. Systematic numerical simulations across a broad range of coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities reveal that synchronization emerges through a nontrivial interplay among these parameters. In general, weak frustration combined with mutually reinforcing coupling promotes synchronization, whereas strong frustration favors coherence under repulsive coupling. Forward and backward parameter sweeps reveal the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states. The presence and width of this bistable region depend sensitively on phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling strength, with higher-order interactions significantly widening the bistable interval. To explain these behaviors, we employ the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation that predicts the forward critical point in the thermodynamic limit, the backward saddle-node point, and the width of the bistable region. Higher order interactions widen this region by shifting the saddle-node point without affecting the forward critical point. Further analysis of Kramer's escape rate explains how noise destabilizes coexistence states and diminishes bistability. Overall, our results provide a unified theoretical and numerical framework for frustrated, noisy, higher-order oscillator networks, revealing that synchronization is strongly influenced by the combined action of phase frustration, stochasticity, and both pairwise and higher-order interactions."}

In the recent years, there has been substantial growth of research interest in modeling, well-posedness analysis, development of numerical methods and numerical algorithms of variational-hemivariational inequalities. This survey paper is devoted to a brief account of well-posedness and numerical analysis results for variational-hemivariational inequalities. The theoretical results are presented for a family of abstract stationary variational-hemivariational inequalities and the main idea is explained for an accessible proof of existence and uniqueness. To better appreciate the distinguished feature of variational-hemivariational inequalities, for comparison, three mechanical problems are introduced leading to a variational equation, a variational inequality, and a variational-hemivariational inequality, respectively. The paper also comments on mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities, with examples from applications in fluid mechanics, and on results concerning the numerical solution of other types (nonstationary, history dependent) of variational-hemivariational inequalities."}

The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead. Therefore, effective inference/post-processing of the obtained super-resolved solution is possible. Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability.

Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials. However, recent studies on magnetic thin films have revealed a drawback of this approach, as the presumed topological Hall contribution may in fact originate from trivial mechanisms. Here, we investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet, whose related compounds have previously been suggested to exhibit a topological Hall effect arising from chiral spin textures. Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Our work shows that the difficulties of identifying chiral spin textures through transport measurements also apply to bulk systems, prompting some existing results to be revisited."}

They model evidence accumulation in simple decision tasks as a stochastic process drifting towards a decision barrier. In models where the drift rate is both time-varying within a trial and variable across trials, the high computational cost for accurate likelihood evaluation has led to the common use of a computationally convenient surrogate for parameter inference, the time-averaged drift approximation (TADA). In each trial, the TADA assumes that the time-varying drift rate can be replaced by its temporal average throughout the trial. This approach enables fast parameter inference using analytical likelihood formulas for DDMs with constant drift. In this work, we show that such an estimator is inconsistent: it does not converge to the true drift, posing a risk of biasing scientific conclusions drawn from parameter estimates produced by TADA and similar surrogates. We provide an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a Brownian motion with piecewise constant drift hitting a one-sided upper boundary. Furthermore, we conduct numerical examples with an attentional DDM (aDDM) to show that the use of TADA systematically misestimates the effect of attention in decision making."}

This paper proposes spectral decompositions of the controllability Gramian and its inverse based on system eigenvalues for a continuous LTI dynamical system in the controllability canonical (companion) form. The Gramian and its inverse are represented as sums of Hermitian matrices, each corresponding to individual system eigenvalues or their pairwise combinations. These decompositions are obtained for the solutions of both algebraic and differential Lyapunov and Riccati equations with arbitrary initial conditions, allowing for the estimation of system spectral properties over an arbitrary time interval and their prediction at future moments. The derived decompositions are also generalized to the case of multiple eigenvalues in the dynamics matrix spectrum, enabling a closed-form estimation of the effects of resonant interactions with the system's eigenmodes. The spectral components are interpreted as measurable quantities in the minimum energy control problem. Therefore, they are unambiguously defined and can quantitatively characterize the influence of individual eigenmodes and associated system devices on controllability, observability, and the asymptotic dynamics of perturbation energy. The additional information obtained from these decompositions can improve the accuracy of algorithms in solving various practical problems, such as stability analysis, minimum energy control, structural design, tuning regulators, optimal placement of actuators and sensors, network analysis, and model order reduction."}

The convergence and performance of the two IRCSI-type algorithms are illustrated by numerical experiments."}

In our recent work we showed that the rate of fluctuation growth for an observable in a closed quantum system is upper bounded by the fluctuation of its corresponding velocity-like observable. That bound also indicated a tradeoff between the time derivatives of the mean and the standard deviation. In this paper we will look at open quantum systems in two cases. For the first case we find the generator of evolution for an open system employing both the Taylor expansion and the standard time-ordered evolution via the Dyson series, while in the second case we consider no specific information about the evolution of the system. We then find the rate of fluctuation growth in each case. Comparing the upper bounds for each case and considering the upper bound found for a closed system suggest that including more details by separating the contributions of the system and state dynamics seems to result in looser bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth."}

After optimizing the growth conditions, phase-pure Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films with a cubic CsCl-type structure were obtained, and their magnetic phase diagram was built. The manipulation of Rh content leads to a rich magnetic phase diagram, where three different regimes can be identified: for $x < 40$, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a ferromagnetic (FM) transition below $T_\\mathrm{C} \\approx$ 330-350 K; for $40 \\le x \\le 45$, in addition to the FM transition at $T_\\mathrm{C} \\approx$ 200 K, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a FM-to-antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx$ 120 K; finally for $x > 45$, only one AFM transition at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx$ 150 K can be tracked. All the Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films exhibit distinct anomalous Hall effect in their magnetically ordered state, which is most likely due to the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. In addition, all the anomalous Hall transport properties, including the resistivity, conductivity, and angle exhibit a strong correlation with the magnetic properties of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, which become most evident for $x$ = 35.

To address the distributional ambiguity, we explore the design of causal affine control policies to minimize the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in the given ambiguity set. The resulting minimax optimal control problem is shown to admit an equivalent reformulation as a tractable convex program that corresponds to a regularized version of the nominal linear-quadratic stochastic control problem.

To address this limitation, we propose a scalable dual projected subgradient method to compute optimal controllers to an arbitrary accuracy.

By discretizing this operator, we obtain a matrix approximation. Importantly, this discretization provides not only an approximating operator but also an approximating semigroup. This point motivates our approach, as we then apply Balakrishnan's representations of fractional powers of operators, which are based on semigroups. Using estimates of the semigroup norm and the norm of the difference between the operator and its matrix approximation, we derive the convergence rate for the approximation of the fractional power of operators with the fractional power of correspondings matrix operators. In addition, an explicit formula for calculating an arbitrary power of a two-band matrix is obtained, which is indispensable in the numerical solution of fractional differential and integral equations."}

We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime.

Efficient modelling and estimation in such settings is key for a number of analysis tasks, such as accurate prediction. However, traditional approaches for modelling such data, for example long memory vector autoregressive processes, are challenging even in modest dimensions, as the number of parameters grows quadratically with the number of modelled variables. Additionally, in many practical data settings, the observed series is accompanied by a (possibly inferred) network that provides information about the presence or absence of between-component associations via the graph edge topology. This article proposes two new models for capturing the dynamics of long memory time series where a network is accounted for. Our approach not only facilitates the analysis of graph-structured long memory time series, but also improves computational efficiency over traditional multivariate long memory models by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional parameter space by adapting likelihood-based estimation algorithms to the network setting. Simulation studies show that our proposed estimation is more stable than traditional models, and is able to tackle data scenarios where current models fail due to computational challenges. While widely applicable, here we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed models on datasets arising in environmental science and finance."}

First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow."}

To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal. Additionally, we emphasize extending quantum communication capabilities beyond traditional optical bands into the terahertz, even possibly to millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, thereby broadening the potential horizon of quantum-secure applications.

For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems."}

Although CBF-based safety filters are often implemented by solving a quadratic program (QP) in real time, the use of off-the-shelf solvers for such optimization problems poses a challenge in applications where control actions need to be computed efficiently at very high frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form expression for controllers obtained through CBF-based safety filters. This expression is obtained by partitioning the state-space into different regions, with a different closed-form solution in each region. We leverage this formula to introduce a resource-aware implementation of CBF-based safety filters that detects changes in the partition region and uses the closed-form expression between changes. We showcase the applicability of our approach in examples ranging from aerospace control to safe reinforcement learning."}

Properties of generalized Spearman correlation are investigated when the functions are piecewise continuous and strictly monotonic, with particular focus on the special cases where the functions are drawn from orthonormal bases defined by Legendre polynomials and cosine functions. For continuous random variables, generalized Spearman correlation is treated as a copula-based measure and shown to depend on a pair of uniform-distribution-preserving (udp) transformations determined by the underlying functions. Bounds for generalized Spearman correlation are derived and a novel technique referred to as stochastic inversion of udp transformations is used to construct singular copulas that attain the bounds and parametric copulas with densities that interpolate between the bounds and model different degrees of non-monotonic dependence. Sample analogues of generalized Spearman correlation are proposed and their asymptotic and small-sample properties are investigated. Potential applications of the theory are demonstrated including: exploratory analyses of the dependence structures of datasets and their symmetries; elicitation of functions maximizing generalized Spearman correlation via expansions in orthonormal basis functions; and construction of tractable probability densities to model a wide variety of non-monotonic dependencies."}

The rare-earth delafossite NaGdS_2 is a triangular-lattice magnet with S = 7/2 spin-only Gd^3+ moments with suppressed single-ion anisotropy. In our study, we estimate that NaGdS_2 has a weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/k_B is about 52mK) and signs of long-range magnetic order are absent down to lowest temperature. However, indications of short range magnetic order are found below 180 mK in the ac susceptibility and thermal expansion. Our results indicate an interplay of Heisenberg-type and dipolar exchange. Due to the large moment of the Gd^3+ ions, one expects a strong impact of the dipolar coupling in NaGdS_2, in contrast to the related NaYbS_2. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements, indeed, indicate the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. NaGdS_2 appears to be a rare system, in which magnetic order is suppressed by a competition between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions."}

We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators.

The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum memory offers a powerful way to study how shared entanglement affects measurement precision. However, under acceleration, the Unruh effect can degrade quantum correlations, raising questions about the reliability of QMA-EUR in such settings. Here, we investigate the QMA-EUR for two uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. Using the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation, we calculate the entropic uncertainty, its lower bound, and the tightness of the relation under different Unruh temperatures. We find that acceleration does not always increase the lower bound on the uncertainty relation. Depending on the initial correlations between the detectors, it may either increase or decrease. This behavior results from the interplay between quantum discord and minimal missing information. Interestingly, a higher quantum discord does not necessarily lead to lower uncertainty."}

It is also to a lesser extent realised that it may be necessary to account for the ensuing estimation bias. A group sequential design is an instance of adaptive clinical trials where a study may change its design dynamically as a reaction to the observed data. There is a widespread perception that one may circumvent the statistical issues associated with the analysis of an adaptive clinical trial by performing the analysis under a Bayesian paradigm. The root of the argument is that the Bayesian posterior is perceived as unaltered by the data-driven adaptations. We examine this claim by analysing a simple trial with a single interim analysis. We approach the interpretation of the trial data under both a frequentist and Bayesian paradigm with a focus on estimation. The conventional result is that the interim analysis impacts the estimation procedure under the frequentist paradigm, but not under the Bayesian paradigm, which may be seen as expressing a \"paradox\" between the two paradigms. We argue that this result however relies heavily on what one would define as the universe of relevant trials defined by first samples of the parameters from a prior distribution and then the data from a sampling model given the parameters. In particular, in this set of trials, whether a connection exists between the parameter of interest and design parameters. We show how an alternative interpretation of the trial yields a Bayesian posterior mean that corrects for the interim analysis with a term that closely resembles the frequentist conditional bias. We conclude that the role of auxiliary trial parameters needs to be carefully considered when constructing a prior in an adaptive design."}

In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based reduced-order modeling strategy, leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on synthetic microvascular graphs to approximate hemodynamic quantities on anatomically realistic domains. Our method combines algorithms for synthetic vascular generation with a physics-informed training procedure that integrates graph topological information and local flow dynamics. To ensure the physical reliability of the learned surrogates, we incorporate a physics-informed loss functional derived from the governing equations, allowing enforcement of mass conservation and rheological constraints. The resulting GNN architecture demonstrates robust generalization capabilities across diverse network configurations. The GNN formulation is validated on benchmark problems with linear and nonlinear rheology, showing accurate pressure and velocity field reconstruction with substantial computational gains over full-order solvers. The methodology showcases significant generalization capabilities with respect to vascular complexity, as highlighted by tests on data from the mouse cerebral cortex. This work establishes a new class of graph-based surrogate models for microvascular flow, grounded in physical laws and equipped with inductive biases that mirror mass conservation and rheological models, opening new directions for real-time inference in vascular modeling and biomedical applications."}

A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\\mathrm{in}} d_{\\mathrm{out}} k/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance."}

For continuous random variables, generalized Spearman correlation is treated as a copula-based measure and shown to depend on a pair of uniform-distribution-preserving (udp) transformations determined by the underlying functions. Bounds for generalized Spearman correlation are derived and a novel technique referred to as stochastic inversion of udp transformations is used to construct singular copulas that attain the bounds and parametric copulas with densities that interpolate between the bounds and model different degrees of non-monotonic dependence. Sample analogues of generalized Spearman correlation are proposed and their asymptotic and small-sample properties are investigated. Potential applications of the theory are demonstrated including: exploratory analyses of the dependence structures of datasets and their symmetries; elicitation of functions maximizing generalized Spearman correlation via expansions in orthonormal basis functions; and construction of tractable probability densities to model a wide variety of non-monotonic dependencies."}

However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases. This discovery simplifies the requirements for generating complex temporal orders and opens a viable route towards the experimental control and manipulation of quasi-time crystalline matter."}

The performance of quantum error correction (QEC) is generally predicted through large-scale numerical simulations, used to estimate thresholds, finite-size scaling, and exponential suppression of logical errors below threshold. The connection of QEC to models from statistical mechanics provides an alternative tool for analysing QEC performance. However, predicting the behaviour of these models also requires large-scale numerical simulations, as analytic solutions are not generally known. Here we exploit an exact mapping, from a toric code under bit-flip noise that is post-selected on being syndrome free to the exactly-solvable two-dimensional Ising model on a torus, to derive an analytic solution for the logical failure rate across its full domain of physical error rates. In particular, this mapping provides closed-form expressions for the logical failure rate in four distinct regimes: the path-counting, below-threshold (ordered), near-threshold (critical), and above-threshold (disordered) regimes. Our framework places a number of familiar and long-standing numerical observations on firm theoretical ground. It also motivates explicit ansätze for the conventional QEC setting of non-post-selected codes whose statistical mechanics mappings involve random-bond disorder. Specifically, we introduce an effective surface tension model for the below-threshold regime, and a new scaling ansatz for the near-threshold regime, derived from an analysis of the ground state energy cost distribution. By bridging statistical mechanics theory and quantum error correction practice, our results offer a new toolkit for designing, benchmarking, and understanding topological codes beyond current computational limits."}

Away from the jump the dynamics is adiabatic, while the sign flip produces a single nonadiabatic kick in the adiabatic basis. Within a simple stepwise adiabatic-sudden approximation we obtain a compact analytic expression for the final transition probability, identify the parameter regimes that yield high-fidelity inversion, and show that the result depends only on the change of the mixing angle across the detuning jump, i.e., solely on the ratio of the peak Rabi frequency to the detuning. Numerical simulations of the full time-dependent Schrödinger equation confirm the validity and robustness of this description over a broad parameter range.\n  We then use the Majorana decomposition to extend the scheme to an SU(2)-symmetric three-state chain driven by the same coupling and detuning functions. In this setting the three-state propagator is expressed in closed form through the two-level Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to derive explicit transition probabilities for all three initial states. In particular, we show that for strong coupling the protocol yields almost complete population transfer between the two outer states, with only small transient population of the middle state, while retaining the same intrinsic robustness as in the underlying two-level model."}

Recent efforts have applied variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based methods to compute waveguide modes, demonstrating the feasibility of simulating TE and TM field distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, these studies typically employ manually designed, fixed-depth parameterized quantum circuits and uniform measurement-shot strategies, resulting in excessive quantum resource consumption, limited circuit expressivity, and reduced robustness under realistic noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an architecture and shot adaptive subspace variational quantum eigensolver for efficient microwave waveguide eigenmode simulation on NISQ devices. The proposed framework integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) based circuit design strategy and an adaptive shot allocation mechanism to jointly reduce quantum resource overhead. Specifically, the RL agent autonomously explores the quantum circuit space to generate hardware-efficient parameterized quantum circuits, while the adaptive measurement scheme allocates sampling resources according to Hamiltonian term weights. Numerical experiments on three- and five-qubit systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate estimation of TE and TM mode eigenvalues, with a minimum absolute error down to $10^{-8}$ and reconstructed field distributions under noiseless conditions in excellent agreement with classical electromagnetic solutions."}

First, we propose two estimation algorithms for DSEU with these accesses utilizing the randomized measurement toolbox. The query complexities of these algorithms are both $O(\\sqrt{d})$.

First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow."}

However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit.

The pulse-based model consistently outperforms its gate-based counterpart, exhibiting higher test accuracy and improved generalization under equivalent noise conditions. Moreover, by systematically increasing noise strength, we show that pulse-level implementations retain higher fidelity for longer, demonstrating enhanced resilience to decoherence and control errors.

We propose a distributed version of the CliNR partial error correction scheme respecting these constraints and we show through circuit level simulations that, even if the entanglement generation time $τ_e$ is up to five times longer than the gate time, distributed CliNR can achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a shorter depth than both the direct implementation and the monolithic CliNR implementation of random Clifford circuits. In the asymptotic regime, we relax assumption (2) and we prove that links producing $O(t/\\ln t)$ Bell pairs in parallel, where $t$ is the number of QPUs, is sufficient to avoid stalling distributed CliNR, independently of the number of qubits per QPU.

Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications."}

Second, we leverage the expressivity of the LUCI framework as an intermediate representation, using integer linear programming to find performant physical circuits from the large space of valid LUCI circuits. We show that on the $d = 11$ surface code at $1\\%(3\\%)$ dropout rate for qubits and couplers, these optimizations allow for a total improvement of $14.5\\%(23.6\\%)$ over $4d$ round of syndrome extraction using the SI1000 noise model at $0.1\\%$ noise."}

Both fidelity and computational cost are strongly dependent on the definition of suitable local domains and Hamiltonian partitions. In this work, we introduce the Multiple-Time QITE algorithm (MT-QITE). We show how using more than one imaginary time substantially improves the fidelity of the resulting ground state as well as the measurement overhead with respect to the previously published QITE algorithm, while preserving its deterministic character and its independence from ad hoc ansatze. Moreover, unlike QITE and other QITE-based algorithms, MT-QITE is parallelizable, and we show that even in Hamiltonians with non-local interactions, partitioning may entail a computational advantage."}

The package operates as follows: given a multipartite quantum state as input, it outputs an estimate of its geometric entanglement. For pure states, it computes the geometric entanglement together with an estimation error. For mixed states, it provides both lower and upper bounds on the geometric entanglement, thereby identifying an interval in which the true value lies. We provide several methods to compute the lower bound, enabling users to balance accuracy against computational cost. We apply entcalc to several representative examples, including for $3\\otimes3$ PPT entangled states, mixtures of GHZ and W states, thermal states of selected three-qubit spin chains, and noisy GHZ and W states. We observe signatures of quantum phase transitions by quantifying entanglement in spin chains. We also demonstrate that entanglement between non-neighbouring sites can be activated by tuning the external magnetic field. In all tested cases, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is found to be very small, indicating that entcalc provides highly accurate estimates of the geometric entanglement for these states."}

Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged."}

This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks."}

Exploiting a hidden time-reversal symmetry, the Wigner representation and the WKB method, we introduce an effective phase-space potential for description of the steady state. It reveals two attracting points, which are metastable due to quantum fluctuations. By employing the Keldysh real-time path integral formalism, we compute the instanton trajectory governing the quantum activation process between these attractors and establish a fundamental connection with the Wigner representation. This relation unifies the steady-state phase-space description with dynamical quantum activation processes. We also derive an analytical expression for the decoherence rate of the system.

Our starting point is the complexity class $\\textsf{NBQP}$ (\"noisy BQP\"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques."}

While classical machine learning-based methods have demonstrated strong performance, they still face challenges in robustness under adversarial conditions. This paper proposes QSTAformer-a tailored quantum-enhanced Transformer architecture that embeds parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into attention mechanisms-for robust and efficient STVSA. A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that QSTAformer achieves competitive accuracy, reduced complexity, and stronger robustness, underscoring its potential for secure and scalable STVSA under adversarial conditions."}

Despite strong theoretical interest, its experimental observation in the FQH state has remained elusive, making it a promising target for realization on current NISQ devices. In this work, we employ a quasi-one-dimensional model of an FQH state coupled to a background metric to probe the geometric response under a metric quench. We design and implement a quantum-circuit protocol that realizes a Hilbert-space-truncated version of the model and extracts the Hall viscosity from the geometric response encoded in the wavefunction dynamics of the device. While the truncation prevents us from accessing the fully quantized value of Hall viscosity, the hardware data nevertheless show excellent agreement with analytical and numerical predictions within this restricted regime."}

We demonstrate that such acceleration can be universally achieved via transient stochastic resetting. This means that during an initial time interval of finite duration, the dynamics is interrupted by resets that take the system to a designated state at randomly selected times. We illustrate this idea for few-body open systems and also for a challenging many-body case, where a first-order phase transition leads to a divergence of relaxation time. In all scenarios, a significant and sometimes even exponential acceleration in reaching the stationary state is observed, similar to the so-called Mpemba effect. The universal nature of this speedup lies in the fact that the design of the resetting protocol only requires knowledge of a few macroscopic properties of the target state, such as the order parameter of the phase transition, while it does not necessitate any fine-tuned manipulation of the initial state."}

Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators.

Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder.
