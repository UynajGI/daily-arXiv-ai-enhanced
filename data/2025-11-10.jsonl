Existing approaches\neither solely depend on rule-based constraints or exclusively utilize deep\nlearning technologies to identify target communities. Therefore, an important\nquestion is proposed: can deep learning be integrated with rule-based\nconstraints to elevate the quality of community search? In this paper, we\naffirmatively address this question by introducing a novel approach called\nNeural Community Search via Attribute-augmented Conductance, abbreviated as\nNCSAC. Specifically, NCSAC first proposes a novel concept of\nattribute-augmented conductance, which harmoniously blends the (internal and\nexternal) structural proximity and the attribute similarity. Then, NCSAC\nextracts a coarse candidate community of satisfactory quality using the\nproposed attribute-augmented conductance. Subsequently, NCSAC frames the\ncommunity search as a graph optimization task, refining the candidate community\nthrough sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques, thereby producing\nhigh-quality results. Extensive experiments on six real-world graphs and ten\ncompetitors demonstrate the superiority of our solutions in terms of accuracy,\nefficiency, and scalability. Notably, the proposed solution outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving an impressive F1-score improvement ranging\nfrom 5.3\\% to 42.4\\%.

However, they inherently contain\nsystematic wind speed biases arising from various factors, including simplified\nphysical parameterizations, observational uncertainties, and limited spatial\nresolution. Among these, low spatial resolution poses a particular challenge\nfor capturing local variability accurately. Whereas prevailing industry\npractice generally relies on either no bias correction or coarse, nationally\nuniform adjustments, we extend and thoroughly analyse a recently proposed\nspatially resolved, cluster-based bias correction framework. This approach is\ndesigned to better account for local heterogeneity and is applied to 319 wind\nfarms across the United Kingdom to evaluate its effectiveness. Results show\nthat this method reduced monthly wind power simulation errors by more than 32%\ncompared to the uncorrected ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The method is further\napplied to the MERRA-2 dataset for comparative evaluation, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and robustness for different reanalysis products. In contrast to\nprior studies, which rarely quantify the influence of topography on reanalysis\nbiases, this research presents a detailed spatial mapping of bias correction\nfactors across the UK. The analysis reveals that for wind energy applications,\nERA5 wind speed errors exhibit strong spatial variability, with the most\nsignificant underestimations in the Scottish Highlands and mountainous areas of\nWales. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for\ngeographic variability when correcting reanalysis wind speeds, and provide new\ninsights into region-specific bias patterns relevant for high-resolution wind\nenergy modelling."}

Altering a PCM cell's state during writes demands substantial\nenergy, posing a significant challenge to PCM's role as the primary main\nmemory. Prior research has explored methods to reduce write energy consumption,\nincluding the elimination of redundant writes, minimizing cell writes, and\nemploying compact row buffers for filtering PCM main memory accesses.

In this work, we develop and evaluate a\npipeline using large language models (LLMs) to generate quantitative priors for\nconnectomics, based on their knowledge of neuroanatomy. We benchmark our\napproach against an evaluation set derived from a gold-standard tractography\natlas, identifying prompting techniques to elicit accurate connectivity\ninformation from the LLMs. We further identify strategies for incorporating\nexternal knowledge sources into the pipeline, which can provide grounding for\nthe LLM and improve accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how the LLM-derived\npriors can augment existing tractography filtering approaches by identifying\ntrue-positive connections to retain during the filtering process. We show that\nthese additional connections can improve the accuracy of a connectome-based\nmodel of pathology spread, which provides supporting evidence that the\nconnections preserved by the LLM are valid."}

In probabilistic record\nlinkage, the effectiveness of such integration relies on the availability of\nlinkage variables free from errors. Where this is lacking, the linked data set\nwould suffer from linkage errors and the resultant analyses, linkage bias. This\npaper proposes a methodology leveraging the bootstrap technique to devise\nlinkage bias-corrected estimators. Additionally, it introduces a test to assess\nwhether increasing the number of bootstrap iterations meaningfully reduces\nlinkage bias or merely inflates variance without further improving accuracy. An\napplication of these methodologies is demonstrated through the analysis of a\nsimulated dataset featuring hormone information, along with a dataset obtained\nfrom linking two data sets from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' labour\nmobility surveys."}

However,\ntraditional AHO systems feature droop coefficients that are dependent on the\noscillator voltage amplitude, limiting their ability to maintain consistent\ngrid support during disturbances and resulting in power-sharing inaccuracies.\nThis paper presents an enhanced AHO (EAHO) strategy, where the active power\ndroop coefficient is no longer a function of the voltage amplitude and retains\nthe key dynamic benefits of the original AHO. The EAHO improves both frequency\nand voltage support and ensures accurate power sharing with other GFM inverters\nin grid-connected and stand-alone modes. Extensive comparative and small-signal\nanalyses, alongside experimental validation on 2.5 kVA single-phase inverters,\nconfirm the EAHO's improved steady-state performance, enhanced active and\nreactive power support, and stable operation under varying grid conditions."}

The\napproach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component\nand the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is\nspecified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the\nnonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical\nsystem structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such\nas stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the\nadvantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and\nadmitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical\nadvantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator\nInference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples\naerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD\n445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online\nprediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and\nsupersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes\nwhile preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference."}

In particular, their compositional\nstructure has been shown to enable efficient approximation of high-dimensional\nfunctions, helping to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in optimal control\nproblems. In this work, we build upon the theoretical framework developed by\nKang & Gong (SIAM J.

We extend this result in two directions. First, we analyze the\nstrict convexity requirement on the cost functional and demonstrate that\nreformulating a discrete-time optimal control problem with linear transitions\nand stage costs as a terminal cost problem ensures the necessary strict\nconvexity. Second, we establish a generalization of Theorem 6.2 in Kang & Gong\n(SIAM J.
