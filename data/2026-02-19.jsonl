Our analysis focuses on the convergence rates of eigenvalue and spectral subspace approximations for compact linear integral operator $K$ with Green's kernels. By employing orthogonal and interpolatory projections at $2r+1$ collocation points (which are not necessarily Gauss points) onto an approximating space of piecewise even degree polynomials, we establish the superconvergence of eigenfunctions under iteration. The modified projection methods achieve a faster convergence rates compared to classical projection methods. The enhancement in convergence rate is verified by numerical examples."}

However, they suffer from an inherent limitation: secular phase-shift errors. While the qualitative ''shape'' of invariant tori is preserved, the numerical solution gradually drifts along the torus, leading to a phase-lag accumulation that degrades long-term positional accuracy. Inspired by the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) scheme, originally developed as an analytical tool for infinite-dimensional systems, we introduce a numerical operator that incorporates frequency updates into a dimension-enlarged Newton iteration to compute quasi-periodic solutions. Unlike conventional time-stepping integrators, our alternating numerical procedure eliminates phase-lag accumulation by directly solving for instantaneous positions and phase angles. Theoretically, provided sufficient computational resources, the phase error can be reduced arbitrarily, remaining independent of the total integration time. Our algorithm translates the Nash-Moser iteration into a practical numerical framework, marking a significant departure from traditional Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory. While KAM provides rigorous existence proofs, its requirement for global Diophantine conditions and the total exclusion of resonant sets render it numerically inaccessible. By employing a ''step-by-step'' exclusion process and incrementally enlarging the dimension, our algorithm resolves irrationality conditions locally. This approach demonstrates that the ''numerical irrationality problem'' is not an intrinsic barrier to computation, offering a constructive, executable alternative to the non-executable nature of global KAM-based methods."}

During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions."}

More importantly, we explore various stochastic modifications to adapt to practical scenarios, such as employing compression techniques for efficient information transmission, enabling partial participation for asynchronous communication, and utilizing coordinate selection for faster local computation. We show that the saddle point reformulation plays a key role and opens up possibilities to use mentioned extension that seem to be impossible in the standard minimization formulation.

Second, we tackle the challenge of unmeasured confounding by introducing a causal representation learning framework. By utilizing instrumental variables, we prove the nonparametric identifiability of the latent confounding subspace under injectivity and completeness conditions. We develop a ``triple machine learning\" estimator that employs cross-fitting scheme to sequentially handle the learned representation, nuisance parameters, and target functional. We characterize the asymptotic distribution with variance inflation induced by representation learning error, and provide conditions for semiparametric efficiency. We also propose a practical VAE-based algorithm for confounding representation learning. Simulations and real-world analysis validate the effectiveness of proposed methods.

We show that equilibria are characterized as follows: In equilibrium, the optimal indemnity function exhibits a layer-type structure, providing full insurance over any loss layer on which the policyholder is more pessimistic than the insurer's pricing functional about tail losses; and no insurance coverage over loss layers on which the policyholder is less pessimistic than the insurer's pricing functional about tail losses. In equilibrium, the optimal pricing distortion function is determined by the policyholder's degree of risk aversion, whereby prices never exceed the policyholder's marginal willingness to insure tail losses. Moreover, we show that both the insurance coverage and the insurer's expected profit increase with the policyholder's degree of risk aversion. Additionally, and echoing recent work in the literature, we show that equilibrium contracts are Pareto efficient, but they do not induce a welfare gain to the policyholder. Conversely, any Pareto-optimal contract that leaves no welfare gain to the policyholder can be obtained as an equilibrium contract. Finally, we consider a few examples of interest that recover some existing results in the literature as special cases of our analysis."}

Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges."}

Fairness-aware community detection seeks to prevent biased node partitions, typically framed in terms of individual fairness, which requires similar nodes to be treated similarly, and group fairness, which aims to avoid disadvantaging specific groups of nodes. While existing literature on fair community detection has primarily focused on group fairness, we introduce a novel measure to quantify individual fairness in community detection methods. The proposed measure captures unfairness as the vectorial distance between a node's true and predicted community representations, computed using the community co-occurrence matrix. We provide a comprehensive empirical investigation of a broad set of community detection algorithms from the literature on both synthetic networks, with varying levels of community explicitness, and real-world networks. We particularly investigate the fairness-performance trade-off using standard quality metrics and compare individual fairness outcomes with existing group fairness measures. The results show that individual unfairness can occur even when group fairness or clustering accuracy is high, underscoring that individual and group fairness are not interchangeable. Moreover, fairness depends critically on the detectability of community structure. However, we find that Significance and Surprise for denser graphs, and Combo, Leiden, and SBMDL for sparser graphs result in a better trade-off between individual fairness and community quality. Overall, our findings, together with the fact that community detection is an important step in many network analysis downstream tasks, highlight the necessity of developing fairness-aware community detection methods."}

Several types of sensors are used to capture dynamic responses and monitor changes during the operation of critical parts of complex systems. Piezoelectric (PZ) materials belong to a class of electroactive materials that convert mechanical deformation into an electrical response. For example, PZ ceramics or PVDF foils are employed for online sensing of the time history of mechanical deformation. This paper focuses on the dynamical response of a cantilever beam structure equipped with a glued PZ sensor and combines experimental and modelling approaches to achieve accurate and reliable results. The time history of the normal velocity at a point on the beam surface was recorded with a laser vibrometer during transient vibrations of the beam, triggered by the sudden removal of a mass load at the beam's free end. Simultaneously, the output voltage of the PZ sensor was measured with an electronic device. An elastodynamic model of a cantilever beam coupled with a piezoelectric sensor is introduced, along with its discretization using the finite element method. The mathematical model includes additional terms that enforce a floating-potential boundary condition to maintain a constant charge on one of the sensor's electrodes and is presented in an extended form suitable for sensitivity analysis or parameter identification. The model implementation is validated using a numerical example corresponding to the experimental setup. The computed results show good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, values of the Rayleigh damping parameters were identified based on the experimental measurements."}

In this work, we study the geometrical properties of this system by applying network embedding techniques to the graph of synaptic connections. Since previous analysis have revealed an inhomogeneous degree distribution, we first employ a hyperbolic embedding approach that maps the neural network onto a point cloud in the two-dimensional hyperbolic space. In general, hyperbolic embedding methods exploit the exponentially growing volume of hyperbolic space with increasing distance from the origin, allowing for an approximately uniform spatial distribution of nodes even in scale-free, small-world networks. By evaluating multiple embedding quality metrics, we find that the network structure is well captured by the resulting two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding, and in fact is more congruent with this representation than with the original neuron coordinates in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In order to examine the network geometry in a broader context, we also apply the well-known Euclidean network embedding approach Node2vec, where the dimension of the embedding space, $d$ can be set arbitrarily. In 3 dimensions, the Euclidean embedding of the network yields lower quality scores compared to the original neuron coordinates. However, as a function of the embedding dimension the scores show an improving tendency, surpassing the level of the 2d hyperbolic embedding roughly at $d=16$, and reaching a maximum around $d=64$. Since network embeddings can serve as valuable inputs for a variety of downstream machine learning tasks, our results offer new perspectives on the structure and representation of this recently revealed and biologically significant neural network."}

We then construct an exponentially optimal non-reversible perturbation that improves the long-time relaxation rate while preserving the stationary target. We analyze how such non-reversible control reshapes the macroscopic dynamical regimes of the phase transitions recently identified in generative diffusion models. We derive a general criterion for the speciation time and show that suitable non-reversible perturbations can accelerate speciation. In contrast, the collapse transition is governed by a trace-controlled phase-space contraction mechanism that is fixed by the symmetric component, and the corresponding collapse time remains unchanged under anti-symmetric perturbations.

This work presents a heterogeneous system that offloads the decomposition workload to an FPGA, tightly integrated with a custom 28nm Ising solver. By migrating the decomposition logic to reconfigurable hardware and utilizing parallel processing elements, the system minimizes the communication latency typically associated with host-device interactions.

Word-level embeddings exhibit uniformly contracting dynamics with no positive LE, while answer-level embeddings, in spite of the overall contraction, display a number of positive LEs and higher-dimensional attractors. The resulting LE spectra robustly separate psychotic from healthy speech, while differentiation within the psychotic group is not statistically significant overall, despite a tendency of the most severe cases to occupy distinct dynamical regimes.

Slow feedbacks are typically activated in response to changes in ocean temperatures on decadal timescales and manifest as changes in climatic state with no recent historical analogue. However, fast feedbacks are activated in response to rapid atmospheric physical processes on weekly timescales, and they are already operative in the present-day climate. This distinction implies that the physics of fast radiative feedbacks is present in the historical meteorological reanalyses used to train many recent successful machine-learning-based (ML) emulators of weather and climate. In addition, these feedbacks are functional under the historical boundary conditions pertaining to the top-of-atmosphere radiative balance and sea-surface temperatures. Together, these factors imply that we can use historically trained ML weather emulators to study the response of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and hence the global hydrological cycle, to perturbations in carbon dioxide and other well-mixed greenhouse gases. Without retraining on prospective Earth system conditions, we use ML weather emulators to quantify the fast precipitation response to reduced and elevated carbon dioxed concentrations with no recent historical precedent. We show that the responses from historically trained emulators agree with those produced by full-physics Earth System Models (ESMs).

We consider two settings involving a finite dictionary of $M$ densities: (i) model aggregation, where $p$ belongs to the dictionary, and (ii) convex aggregation (mixture density estimation), where $p$ is a mixture of densities from the dictionary. Crucially, we make no assumption on the base densities: their ratios may be unbounded and their supports may differ. For both problems, we identify the best possible high-probability guarantees in terms of the dictionary size, sample size, and confidence level. These optimal rates are higher than those achievable when density ratios are bounded by absolute constants; for mixture density estimation, they match existing lower bounds in the special case of discrete distributions.\n  Our analysis of the mixture case hinges on two new covering results. First, we provide a sharp, distribution-free upper bound on the local Hellinger entropy of the class of mixtures of $M$ distributions.

To address this limitation, rolling friction is commonly introduced as an approximation to account for particle shape effects by applying a resistive torque to spherical particles. Among existing rolling friction formulations, the spring-dashpot (S-D) type model is widely recognized for its numerical stability and realistic representation of rolling resistance. However, conventional S-D models require multiple empirical parameters that must be calibrated in an interdependent manner, leading to increased experimental effort, parameter ambiguity, and uncertainty in practical applications. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a new S-D type rolling friction model that reduces the parameter set to a single physically meaningful quantity: the critical rolling angle. Derived from theoretical considerations, this parameter characterizes the transition from static to rolling motion at particle contacts. The use of a single parameter simplifies implementation and eliminates the need for extensive calibration. Stability analysis demonstrates that the proposed model allows particles to reach a physically consistent equilibrium state without spurious rotational oscillations. For large-scale applications, the model is further integrated into a coarse-grained DEM framework. Validation using DEM-CFD simulations of an incinerator system confirms that the proposed approach successfully reproduces the macroscopic behavior of the original particle system.

A two-phase iterative method is proposed, partitioning the CEMUAVGRP into a general routing phase where a satisfactory route including required nodes and edges for each UAV is obtained without considering the disk neighborhoods of required nodes, and a close-enough routing phase where representative points are optimized for each required node in the determined route. To be specific, a variable neighborhood descent (VND) heuristic is proposed for the general routing phase, while a second-order cone programming (SOCP) procedure is applied in the close-enough routing phase. These two phases are performed in an iterative fashion under the framework of an adaptive iterated local search (AILS) algorithm until the predefined termination criteria are satisfied. Extensive experiments and comparative studies are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed AILS-VND-SOCP algorithm and the superiority of disk neighborhoods."}

While Cox proportional hazards models treat competing events as independent censoring, Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models explicitly handle competing risks, targeting different estimands. This simulation study using bivariate copula models systematically varies competing event rates (0.5%-5% annually), treatment effects on competing events (50% reduction to 50% increase), and correlation structures to compare these approaches. At competing event rates typical of CV outcome trials (~1% annually), Cox and Fine-Gray produce nearly identical hazard ratio estimates regardless of correlation strength or treatment effect direction. Substantial divergence occurs only with high competing rates and directionally discordant treatment effects, though neither estimator provides unbiased estimates of true marginal hazard ratios under these conditions. In typical CV trial settings with low competing event rates, Cox models remain appropriate for primary analysis due to superior interpretability. Pre-specified Cox models should not be abandoned for competing risk methods. Importantly, Fine-Gray models do not constitute proper sensitivity analyses to Cox models per ICH E9(R1), as they target different estimands rather than testing assumptions. As supplementary analysis, cumulative incidence using Aalen-Johansen estimator can provide transparency about competing risk impact. Under high competing-risk scenarios, alternative approaches such as inverse probability of censoring weighting, multiple imputation, or inclusion of all-cause mortality in primary endpoints warrant consideration."}

To determine whether these results extend to more generic one-dimensional models, particularly those realizable in quantum simulators, we investigate spin and energy transport in non-integrable, long-range Heisenberg models using state-of-the-art tensor network methods. Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 < α< \\infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \\sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges. Finally, we consider anisotropic spin models naturally realized in Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules, demonstrating that a wide range of long-lived, non-diffusive transport can be observed in experimental settings."}

Existing tools typically extract narrow, study-specific facts in isolation, failing to preserve the cross-study context required to answer broader scientific questions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising way to overcome this limitation by combining large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval, but its effectiveness depends strongly on how domain knowledge is represented. In this work, we develop two retrieval pipelines: a dense semantic vector-based approach (VectorRAG) and a graph-based approach (GraphRAG). Using over 1,000 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) papers, we construct context-preserving paragraph embeddings and a canonicalized structured knowledge graph supporting entity disambiguation and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate these pipelines through standard retrieval metrics, comparisons with general state-of-the-art systems such as GPT and Gemini, and qualitative validation by a domain chemist. The results show that GraphRAG achieves higher precision and interpretability, while VectorRAG provides broader recall, highlighting complementary trade-offs. Expert validation further confirms that the tailored pipelines, particularly GraphRAG, produce well-grounded, citation-reliable responses with strong domain relevance. By grounding every statement in evidence, these systems enable researchers to navigate the literature, compare findings across studies, and uncover patterns that are difficult to extract manually. More broadly, this work establishes a practical framework for building materials science assistants using curated corpora and retrieval design, reducing reliance on proprietary models while enabling trustworthy literature analysis at scale."}

The dataset is constructed using a reconstruction method that infers age-disaggregated TB cases and fatalities at the district level by integrating province-level age-specific statistics with district-level spatial and demographic data, enabling analyses that account for both spatial heterogeneity and age structure. Building on an existing hospital allocation framework, we extend the objective function to an age-weighted formulation and apply it to the reconstructed dataset to minimize TB fatalities under different age-weighting schemes. We demonstrate that incorporating age structure can give rise to distinct optimized hospital allocation patterns, even when the total number of minimized fatalities is similar, revealing trade-offs between efficiency and demographic targeting.

This instability implies that local perturbations can lead to macroscopic correlation profiles, a breaking of clustering properties and even macroscopic quantum superpositions. In this work, we investigate the effect of interaction on this phenomenology by considering an interacting model with conserved domain wall number, that possesses a ferromagnetic ground state breaking the Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We first show that a local quench in this system amplifies quantum interferences, producing a macroscopic magnetisation profile that directly reflects the scattering phase of the model. Then, we use two asymmetry measures, namely the Entanglement Asymmetry (EA) and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), to characterise the quantum coherence associated with the fluctuations of the magnetisation. By focusing on subsystems comparable in size to the light-cone of the perturbation, we confirm the emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence throughout the whole perturbed region. Finally, we discuss the link between EA and QFI and show that the variance/EA inequality for pure state can be generalised to a QFI/EA inequality for mixed states."}

Two architectures, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), were trained for fixed source problems to learn the mapping from anisotropic neutron sources, Q(x,μ), to the corresponding angular fluxes, ψ(x,μ), in a one-dimensional slab geometry. Three distinct models were trained for each neural operator, corresponding to different scattering ratios (c = 0.1, 0.5, & 1.0), providing insight into their performance across distinct transport regimes (absorption-dominated, moderate, and scattering-dominated). The models were subsequently evaluated on a wide range of previously unseen source configurations, demonstrating that FNO generally achieves higher predictive accuracy, while DeepONet offers greater computational efficiency. Both models offered significant speedups that become increasingly pronounced as the scattering ratio increases, requiring <0.3% of the runtime of a conventional S_N solver. The surrogate models were further incorporated into the S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing the computationally intensive transport sweep loop with a single forward pass. Across varying fission cross sections and spatial-angular grids, both neural operator solvers reproduced reference eigenvalues with deviations up to 135 pcm for DeepONet and 112 pcm for FNO, while reducing runtime to <0.1% of that of the S_N solver on relatively fine grids. These results demonstrate the strong potential of neural operator frameworks as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, paving the way for real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization."}

It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface."}

Under stepsizes independent of the network topology and the number of local updates, we establish sublinear and linear convergence rates for FlexATC in convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Remarkably, in the strong convex setting, the linear rate is decoupled from the objective functions and network topology, and FlexATC permits communication to be skipped in most iterations without any deterioration of the linear rate.

We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision problem that is solved through a multi-agent reinforcement learning task in which agents use stigmergic signals (key performance indicators at the system level) to infer and react to global states. Through a 3x3 factorial design on an IEEE 34-node topology, we evaluated three training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and three algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC). Results identify APPO-DTDE as the optimal configuration, achieving a coordination score of 91.7% relative to the theoretical centralized benchmark (CTCE). However, a critical trade-off emerges between efficiency and stability: while the centralized benchmark maximizes allocative efficiency with a peer-to-peer trade ratio of 0.6, the fully decentralized approach (DTDE) demonstrates superior physical stability. Specifically, DTDE reduces the variance of grid balance by 31% compared to hybrid architectures, establishing a highly predictable, import-biased load profile that simplifies grid regulation. Furthermore, topological analysis reveals emergent spatial clustering, where decentralized agents self-organize into stable trading communities to minimize congestion penalties. While SAC excelled in hybrid settings, it failed in decentralized environments due to entropy-driven instability. This research proves that stigmergic signaling provides sufficient context for complex grid coordination, offering a robust, privacy-preserving alternative to expensive centralized communication infrastructure."}

Systems of various densities are instantaneously quenched from high to low temperatures where a liquid-liquid separation is observed. Densities and the composition of each liquid state are used to check the level rule, along with density and pressure profiles, demonstrating local equilibrium of liquid-liquid phase separation. The transition from the liquid-liquid phase separation in the supercooled region to the glass transition region is modeled by adopting a Markov Network Model to estimate the temperature dependent viscosity using liquid-liquid interfacial information from the classification."}

In this work, we introduce a fully quantum graph convolutional architecture designed explicitly for unsupervised learning in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime. Our approach combines a variational quantum feature extraction layer with an edge-local and qubit-efficient quantum message-passing mechanism inspired by the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) framework. Unlike prior models that rely on global operations or multi-controlled unitaries, our model decomposes message passing into pairwise interactions along graph edges using only hardware-native single- and two-qubit gates. This design reduces the qubit requirement from $O(Nn)$ to $O(n)$ for a graph with $N$ nodes and $n$-qubit feature registers, enabling implementation on current quantum devices regardless of graph size. We train the model using the Deep Graph Infomax objective to perform unsupervised node representation learning. Experiments on the Cora citation network and a large-scale genomic SNP dataset demonstrate that our model remains competitive with prior quantum and hybrid approaches."}

TV regularization has a long history in regression and density estimation, including results on $L^2$ and KL divergence convergence rates. Here, we revisit this task using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) framework. We formulate a HAL-based maximum likelihood estimator (HAL-MLE) using the log-spline link function from \\citet{kooperberg1992logspline}, and show that in the univariate setting the bounded sectional variation norm assumption underlying HAL coincides with the classical bounded TV assumption. This equivalence directly connects HAL-MLE to existing TV-penalized approaches such as local adaptive splines \\citep{mammen1997locally}. We establish three new theoretical results: (i) the univariate HAL-MLE is asymptotically linear, (ii) it admits pointwise asymptotic normality, and (iii) it achieves uniform convergence at rate $n^{-(k+1)/(2k+3)}$ up to logarithmic factors for the smoothness order $k \\geq 1$. These results extend existing results from \\citet{van2017uniform}, which previously guaranteed only uniform consistency without rates when $k=0$. We will include the uniform convergence for general dimension $d$ in the follow-up work of this paper. The intention of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the TV-penalized density estimation methods, and to connect the HAL-MLE to the existing TV-penalized methods in the univariate case, despite that the general HAL-MLE is defined for multivariate cases."}

As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems."}

We develop an equal-order virtual element method for the Stokes--Poisson--Boltzmann equations that naturally handles general polygonal meshes, including meshes with hanging nodes, without requiring special treatment or remeshing. The key innovation is a residual-based pressure stabilization scheme derived by reformulating the Laplacian drag force in the momentum equation as a weighted advection term involving the nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equation, thereby eliminating second-order derivative terms while maintaining theoretical rigor. Well-posedness of the coupled stabilized problem is established using the Banach and Brouwer fixed-point theorems under sufficiently small data assumptions, and optimal a priori error estimates are derived in the energy norm with convergence rates of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^k)$ for approximation degree $k \\geq 1$. Numerical experiments on diverse polygonal meshes -- including distorted elements, non-convex polygons, Voronoi tessellations, and configurations with hanging nodes -- confirm optimal convergence rates, validating theoretical predictions. Applications to electro-osmotic flows in nanopore sensors with complex obstacle geometries illustrate the method's practical utility for engineering simulations. Compared to Taylor--Hood finite element formulations, the equal-order approach simplifies implementation through uniform polynomial treatment of all fields and offers native support for general polygonal elements."}

For the purpose of proving the existence of a multiplicative control forcing the solution rest at a time $T>0$, we need to establish the decay property of solutions for the system without control first. We have obtained decay estimates for the $L^\\infty$-norm and the $H^1$-norm of solutions to the homogenous quasilinear parabolic equations. Notably, the decay of the $L^\\infty$-norm requires no smallness condition on the initial data, whereas the decay of the $H^1$-norm requires that the $L^\\infty$-norm remains small. Based on the decay estimates and maximum modulus estimate of solutions to quasilinear parabolic equations, together with the local null controllability of quasilinear parabolic equations under additive controls, we prove the null controllability of the quasilinear parabolic equations via multiplicative controls. As a byproduct, we also obtain the global null controllability for large time to the quasilinear parabolic equations via additive controls. Given that the controllability under multiplicative control is achieved over a long time horizon, we finally investigate the existence of time optimal control."}

To determine whether these results extend to more generic one-dimensional models, particularly those realizable in quantum simulators, we investigate spin and energy transport in non-integrable, long-range Heisenberg models using state-of-the-art tensor network methods. Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 < α< \\infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \\sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges. Finally, we consider anisotropic spin models naturally realized in Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules, demonstrating that a wide range of long-lived, non-diffusive transport can be observed in experimental settings."}

In this work, we introduce a subsampling-based approach aimed at reducing the computational burden associated with estimation and two-sample hypothesis testing. Our strategy involves selecting a small random subset of nodes from the network, conducting inference on the resulting subgraph, and then using interpolation based on the observed connections between the subsample and the rest of the nodes to estimate the entire graph. We develop the methodology under the generalized random dot product graph framework, which affords broad applicability and permits rigorous analysis. Within this setting, we establish consistency guarantees and corroborate the practical effectiveness of the approach through comprehensive simulation studies."}

The method is applied to crystalline argon modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential, a paradigmatic system where quantum effects strongly affect both thermodynamic and transport properties. From PIMC simulations, we obtain the temperature-dependent phonon frequencies, lifetimes, and specific heat. From the imaginary time correlations of the energy current, we extract the thermal transport coefficients based on a physically motivated prior. We show that the experimentally observed increase of the thermal conductivity at low temperatures cannot be explained within a standard Peierls-Boltzmann framework or quasi-harmonic approximation using phonon lifetimes alone. Instead, a distinct transport lifetime emerges from the analysis of heat-current correlations. Our results demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo methods provide a robust, non-perturbative framework to investigate heat transport in insulating solids, beyond the limits of classical molecular dynamics and quasi-harmonic approximations."}

In particular, the Induced p-Median Problem with Upgrades (IpMU) represents a variation of the classical p-Median problem, where the concepts of transport cost and time are separated as distinct metrics in the input graph of the problem.

In this approach, a larger set of state-of-the-art instances was analysed to ensure a fair comparison with previous proposals. In addition, the characteristics of the instances were studied to assess their complexity. The results obtained are promising when compared to the state-of-the-art, which is based entirely on mathematical programming models. The execution time was improved on average by two orders of magnitude for the harder instances, and the best known result was obtained in more than 99% of the tested instances."}

Clifford tensor networks combine the benefits of both approaches, exploiting Clifford circuits to reduce the classical complexity of the tensor network description of states, with promising effects on simulation approaches. We study the disentangling power of Clifford transformations acting on tensor networks, with a particular emphasis on entanglement cooling strategies. We identify regimes where exact or heuristic Clifford disentanglers are effective, explain the link between the two approaches, and characterize their breakdown as non-Clifford resources accumulate. Additionally, we prove that, beyond stabilizer settings, no Clifford operation can universally disentangle even a single qubit from an arbitrary non-Clifford rotation. Our results clarify both the capabilities and fundamental limitations of Clifford-based simulation methods."}

Numerical simulations reveal a non-trivial topological transition (TT) in the $(Δ, m)$ plane, marking a change from a topologically trivial regime to non-trivial topology. This transition signals the emergence of topological complexity in the model, where higher-order structures develop self-similarly across scales. Beyond this transition, the network exhibits self-similar topological growth, evidenced by a power-law decay in the increments of $Δ$-simplices with $m$-dependent exponents. An analogous transition occurs in the Betti numbers, which display self-similar behavior near the TT and an arctangent dependence farther from it. Based on simulation data, we propose explicit scaling relations describing the behavior of both $Δ$-simplices and Betti numbers near the TT. Overall, the analysis reveals a rich, gapful topological transition structure, where topological quantities exhibit discrete jumps at the transition point."}

Nonetheless, fabrication challenges and performance degradation attributable to surface oxidation and lack of uniformity in films thinner than 5 nm remain a significant barrier for achieving high-quality detectors. In this work, we study the influence of a Silicon capping layer on film properties and on the performance of SNSPDs. A Silicon capping layer effectively suppresses oxidation and increases the superconducting transition temperature. This enables superconductivity in films as thin as 3 nm at 3 K, increases critical current in patterned nanowires and significantly extends the saturation plateau from the visible to the near infrared (up to 2050 nm): These detectors maintain sub-50 ps timing jitter, even for nanowires as wide as 250 nm and with detection areas of 20x20μm2. Our results establish that thinner films protected by a capping layer allow for the fabrication of wider wires, decreasing nanofabrication challenges and extending the operating temperature range for efficient single photon detection."}

A key contribution is a variational formulation that makes the DGP to deep neural network (DNN) correspondence explicit: maximizing the DGP evidence lower bound (ELBO) is equivalent to training DNNs with weight decay and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. This yields fast mini-batch stochastic optimization without Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), while providing principled uncertainty quantification through MC-dropout forward passes as approximate posterior draws, producing calibrated credible surfaces for prediction and spatial effect estimation. Across simulations, DNC is competitive with existing spatial factor models, particularly under strong nonstationarity and complex cross-dependence, while delivering substantial computational gains.

Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range.

We propose a strategy to combine unbiased and biased estimators from a sensitivity analysis perspective. We derive a sequence of confidence intervals indexed by the magnitude of the bias, which enable researchers to assess how conclusions vary with the bias levels. Importantly, we introduce the notion of the b-value, a critical value of the unknown maximum relative bias at which combining estimators does not yield a significant result. We apply this strategy to three canonical combined estimators: the precision-weighted estimator, the pretest estimator, and the soft-thresholding estimator. For each estimator, we characterize the sequence of confidence intervals and determine the bias threshold at which the conclusion changes. Based on the theory, we recommend reporting the b-value based on the soft-thresholding estimator and its associated confidence intervals, which are robust to unknown bias and achieve the lowest worst-case risk among the alternatives."}

We define this phenomenon for quantum states and classical probability distributions, and explore it in three complementary models, one of which exhibits nontrivial quantum coherence at short times. Our main conclusions are as follows. In one dimension, the strong symmetry is not spontaneously broken at any finite time; however, correlators probing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking develop order on length scales that grow linearly in time, parametrically faster than charge diffusion. We provide numerical evidence for this scaling in multiple distinct probes of SW-SSB, and derive it from a field-theory analysis. Moreover, we relate this scaling to the problem of inferring the charge inside a subregion by measuring its surroundings, and construct explicit decoding protocols that illustrate its origin. In two dimensions, field theory and numerical simulations support a finite-time Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like SW-SSB transition. Within continuum hydrodynamics, by contrast, SW-SSB happens at infinitesimal time in two or more dimensions. The SW-SSB transition time can thus be interpreted as marking the emergence of a continuum hydrodynamic description, or (more precisely) the timescale beyond which non-hydrodynamic information such as discrete particle worldlines can no longer be inferred. We support this picture by analyzing a model in which we exploit SW-SSB to derive a classical stochastic hydrodynamic description from the underlying quantum dynamics."}

However, an alternative angle of attack to leverage machine learning in physics is through the path integral formulation, which has so far received far more limited attention. In this paper, we explore how reinforcement learning can be used to compute a class of Euclidean path integrals that yield the thermal density matrix of a quantum system, thereby enabling the computation of the free energy or other thermal expectation values. In particular, we propose a two-step approach with the unique feature that after a variational approximation for a quantity is obtained in a first step, it can then be used to efficiently compute the exact result in a second step. We benchmark this method on several simple systems and then apply it to the quantum rotor chain."}

As shown in Li and Song (2017), it enjoys a convergence rate that is independent of the dimension of the predictor, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we establish an improved convergence rate of GSIR under additional mild eigenvalue decay rate and smoothness conditions. Our convergence rate can be made arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/3}$ under appropriate decay rate and smoothness parameters. As a comparison, the rate of Li and Song (2017) is $n^{-1/4}$ under the best conditions. This improvement is significant because, for example, in a semiparametric estimation problem involving an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter, the convergence rate of the estimator of the nuisance parameter is often required to be faster than $n^{-1/4}$ to guarantee desired semiparametric properties such as asymptotic efficiency. This can be achieved by the improved convergence rate, but not by the original rate. The sharpened convergence rate can also be established for GSIR in more general settings, such as functional sufficient dimension reduction."}

Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges."}

Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 < α< \\infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \\sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges.

For estimating the regression mean $μ=\\E\\,(Y\\midd x_0)$, for the covariate vector of a given individual, there is a list of competing estimators, say $\\hattμ_S$ for each submodel $S$. Exact expressions are found for the relative mean squared error risks, when compared to the widest model available, say $\\mse_S/\\mse_\\wide$.

The machinery is extended to handle many focus parameters at the same time, with appropriate averaged FRIC scores. The particular case where all available covariate vectors have equal importance yields a new overall criterion for variable selection, balancing complexity and fit in a natural fashion. A connection to the Mallows criterion is demonstrated, leading also to natural modifications of the latter. The FRIC and AFRIC strategies are illustrated for real data."}

Quantum corrections to the leading term form a series in powers of $1/[S(S+1)]$. This representation provides a rigorous basis for classical modeling of realistic magnetic Hamiltonians.

In this work, we introduce a fully quantum graph convolutional architecture designed explicitly for unsupervised learning in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime. Our approach combines a variational quantum feature extraction layer with an edge-local and qubit-efficient quantum message-passing mechanism inspired by the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) framework. Unlike prior models that rely on global operations or multi-controlled unitaries, our model decomposes message passing into pairwise interactions along graph edges using only hardware-native single- and two-qubit gates. This design reduces the qubit requirement from $O(Nn)$ to $O(n)$ for a graph with $N$ nodes and $n$-qubit feature registers, enabling implementation on current quantum devices regardless of graph size. We train the model using the Deep Graph Infomax objective to perform unsupervised node representation learning.

Our approach posits an approximate factor structure on the unobserved errors of the mediator model, extracts common latent factors, and constructs decorrelated pseudo-mediators for the subsequent inferential procedure. We establish the asymptotic normality of the debiased estimator and develop a multiple testing procedure with theoretical FDR control under mild high-dimensional conditions. By adjusting for latent factor induced dependence, FADMT also improves robustness to spurious associations driven by shared latent variation in observational studies. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior finite-sample performance across a wide range of correlation structures.

These states arise from the coexistence of bound states embedded in the energy continuum and bound states outside it, leading to hybrid oscillatory modes. We analytically derive the conditions required for the emergence of these states, numerically simulate their formation through spontaneous emission, and predict their long-time behaviour. Our results demonstrate that such bound-state superpositions enable the generation of emitter-emitter interaction through free evolution, while supporting oscillatory breathing modes of the photon density between the emitters."}

We define this phenomenon for quantum states and classical probability distributions, and explore it in three complementary models, one of which exhibits nontrivial quantum coherence at short times. Our main conclusions are as follows. In one dimension, the strong symmetry is not spontaneously broken at any finite time; however, correlators probing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking develop order on length scales that grow linearly in time, parametrically faster than charge diffusion. We provide numerical evidence for this scaling in multiple distinct probes of SW-SSB, and derive it from a field-theory analysis. Moreover, we relate this scaling to the problem of inferring the charge inside a subregion by measuring its surroundings, and construct explicit decoding protocols that illustrate its origin. In two dimensions, field theory and numerical simulations support a finite-time Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like SW-SSB transition. Within continuum hydrodynamics, by contrast, SW-SSB happens at infinitesimal time in two or more dimensions. The SW-SSB transition time can thus be interpreted as marking the emergence of a continuum hydrodynamic description, or (more precisely) the timescale beyond which non-hydrodynamic information such as discrete particle worldlines can no longer be inferred. We support this picture by analyzing a model in which we exploit SW-SSB to derive a classical stochastic hydrodynamic description from the underlying quantum dynamics."}

TV regularization has a long history in regression and density estimation, including results on $L^2$ and KL divergence convergence rates. Here, we revisit this task using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) framework. We formulate a HAL-based maximum likelihood estimator (HAL-MLE) using the log-spline link function from \\citet{kooperberg1992logspline}, and show that in the univariate setting the bounded sectional variation norm assumption underlying HAL coincides with the classical bounded TV assumption. This equivalence directly connects HAL-MLE to existing TV-penalized approaches such as local adaptive splines \\citep{mammen1997locally}. We establish three new theoretical results: (i) the univariate HAL-MLE is asymptotically linear, (ii) it admits pointwise asymptotic normality, and (iii) it achieves uniform convergence at rate $n^{-(k+1)/(2k+3)}$ up to logarithmic factors for the smoothness order $k \\geq 1$. These results extend existing results from \\citet{van2017uniform}, which previously guaranteed only uniform consistency without rates when $k=0$. We will include the uniform convergence for general dimension $d$ in the follow-up work of this paper. The intention of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the TV-penalized density estimation methods, and to connect the HAL-MLE to the existing TV-penalized methods in the univariate case, despite that the general HAL-MLE is defined for multivariate cases."}

Of particular interest in such systems is to understand the circumstances in which, despite the ability to apply time-dependent controls, they lose information about their initial state exponentially with time i.e., their dynamics are exponentially contractive. While there exists an extensive framework to study contractivity for time-independent Lindbladians, their time-dependent counterparts are far less well understood. In this paper, we study the contractivity of Lindbladians, which have a fixed dissipator (describing the interaction with an environment), but with a time-dependent driving Hamiltonian. We establish exponential contractivity in the limit of sufficiently small or sufficiently slow drives together with explicit examples showing that, even when the fixed dissipator is exponentially contractive by itself, a sufficiently large or a sufficiently fast Hamiltonian can result in non-contractive dynamics. Furthermore, we provide a number of sufficient conditions on the fixed dissipator that imply exponential contractivity independently of the Hamiltonian. These sufficient conditions allow us to completely characterize Hamiltonian-independent contractivity for unital dissipators and for two-level systems."}

As shown in Li and Song (2017), it enjoys a convergence rate that is independent of the dimension of the predictor, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we establish an improved convergence rate of GSIR under additional mild eigenvalue decay rate and smoothness conditions. Our convergence rate can be made arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/3}$ under appropriate decay rate and smoothness parameters. As a comparison, the rate of Li and Song (2017) is $n^{-1/4}$ under the best conditions. This improvement is significant because, for example, in a semiparametric estimation problem involving an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter, the convergence rate of the estimator of the nuisance parameter is often required to be faster than $n^{-1/4}$ to guarantee desired semiparametric properties such as asymptotic efficiency. This can be achieved by the improved convergence rate, but not by the original rate. The sharpened convergence rate can also be established for GSIR in more general settings, such as functional sufficient dimension reduction."}

The control scheme is divided into two steps. The first one is dedicated to the estimation of the leader state by each follower in a distributed way and in a fixed-time. Then, based on the estimate of the leader state, each follower computes its control law to track the leader in a fixed-time. In this paper, two control strategies are investigated and compared to solve the two mentioned steps. The first one is an autonomous protocol which ensures a fixed-time convergence for the observer and for the controller parts where the Upper Bound of the Settling-Time (UBST) is set a priory by the user. Then, the previous strategy is redesigned using time-varying gains to obtain a non-autonomous protocol. This enables to obtain less conservative estimates of the UBST while guaranteeing that the time-varying gains remain bounded. Some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols."}

In this work, we show that classical symmetries can be systematically exploited as a design principle for QAOA. Focusing on the MaxCut problem with global bit-flip symmetry, we analyze reduced QAOA instances obtained by fixing a single variable and study how this choice affects the associated DLAs. We show that the structure of the DLAs can change dramatically depending on which variable is held fixed. In particular, we construct explicit examples where the dimension collapses from exponential to quadratic, uncovering phenomena that do not appear in the original formulation.\n  Numerical experiments on asymmetric graphs indicate that such reductions often produce DLAs of much smaller dimension, suggesting improved trainability. We also prove that any graph can be embedded into a slightly larger one (requiring only quadratic overhead) such that the standard reduced DLA coincides with the free reduced DLA, in most cases implying exponential dimension and irreducibility on the Hilbert space for reduced QAOA instances. These results establish symmetry-aware reduction as a principled tool for designing expressive and potentially trainable QAOA circuits."}

In this paper, we explore how reinforcement learning can be used to compute a class of Euclidean path integrals that yield the thermal density matrix of a quantum system, thereby enabling the computation of the free energy or other thermal expectation values. In particular, we propose a two-step approach with the unique feature that after a variational approximation for a quantity is obtained in a first step, it can then be used to efficiently compute the exact result in a second step. We benchmark this method on several simple systems and then apply it to the quantum rotor chain."}

In this work, we propose TNQE, a circuit-efficient quantum data encoding framework built on structured unitary tensor network (TN) representations. TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make this compilation trainable while respecting the unitary nature of quantum operations, we introduce a unitary-aware constraint that parameterizes TN cores as learnable block unitaries, enabling them to be directly optimized and directly encoded as quantum operators. The proposed TNQE framework enables explicit control over circuit depth and qubit resources, allowing the construction of shallow, resource-efficient circuits. Across a range of benchmarks, TNQE achieves encoding circuits as shallow as $0.04\\times$ the depth of amplitude encoding, while naturally scaling to high-resolution images ($256 \\times 256$) and demonstrating practical feasibility on real quantum hardware."}

Such constraints can give rise to striking and counter-intuitive phenomena, including local broadcasting of entangled states and failures of entanglement monogamy. These effects naturally arise in tomographically nonlocal theories (like real quantum theory, twirled worlds, or fermionic quantum theory), where composite systems possess holistic degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to local measurements. In this work, we study entanglement in such theories within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We show that the failure of tomographic locality leads to two qualitatively distinct forms of entanglement, which we term $\\textit{tomographically-local}$ entanglement and $\\textit{tomographically-nonlocal}$ entanglement. We analyze the operational consequences of this distinction, proving that tomographically-nonlocal entanglement is useless for Bell nonlocality, steering, and teleportation, but sufficient for dense coding and perfectly secure data hiding. This framework clarifies the origin of several previously puzzling features of entanglement that arise when tomographic locality fails, as can happen even in quantum theory when one considers fermions or fundamental superselection rules."}

Quantum Foundational Options", "comment": "8 pages, one line diagram", "summary": "Darwinian evolution requires (i) heritable records, (ii) repeatable copying with variation, and (iii) routine irreversibility. Categorical quantum mechanics (CQM) makes precise why ``copy'' and ``delete'' are not generic quantum operations: they exist only for a realized \\emph{classical data} sector (a preferred basis/observable; a commutative structure). Decoherence explains how a pointer basis can be selected dynamically, but it does not by itself select a unique outcome. This motivates a neutral presentation of the main ontological options (unique-history, decohered multiplicity, agent-relative facticity, and a stochastic foundation with variable diffusion). We also note the relevance of the ``agency constraint'' argued by Adlam-McQueen-Waegell: in a strictly coherent, basis-unselected ``purely quantum'' regime, minimal agency fails due to no-cloning and linearity, which sharpens the role of classical resources for record-based processes. Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios then serve as a stress test, since they treat ``friends'' simultaneously as coherent quantum systems and as agents possessing stable records. Finally, a stochastic-mechanics foundation (with variable diffusion) offers a continuous bridge between quantum and classical regimes, and suggests a principled way to implement measurement update as conditioning plus a time-symmetric minimal-change rule."}

Physically relevant quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise are generically non-Markovian and analytically intractable. Further, their Markovian limits are generically inequivalent when using either the Ito or Stratonovich conventions for the same quantum stochastic processes. We introduce a quantum noise homogenization scheme that temporally coarse-grains non-Markovian, colored-noise driven quantum stochastic processes and connects them to their effective white-noise (Markovian) limits. Our approach uses a novel phase-space augmentation that maps the non-Markovian dynamics into a higher dimensional Markovian system and then applies a controlled perturbative coarse-graining scheme in the characteristic time scales of the noise. This allows an explicit analytical algorithm to derive effective Markovian generators with renormalized coefficients and enables imposing various physical constraints on them. We thus resolve the Ito-Stratonovich ambiguity for multiplicative colored noise driven quantum stochastic processes, wherein we show that their consistent Markovian limit corresponds to the Stratonovich convention with renormalized coefficients as well as Ito correction terms. By assuming their Markovian limit unravels completely positive, trace-preserving maps, we further characterize a physically relevant family of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise."}

The simultaneous acquisition of both signals provides a common-mode reference that enables a fair and unambiguous benchmark of quantum advantage. Spectral analysis of the interferometric outputs reveals that quantum correlations do not increase the amplitude of the modulation peak, but instead lower the associated noise floor, resulting in the expected 3 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. This enhancement persists in the sub-shot-noise regime, where the classical signal becomes buried in the spectral background while the two-photon contribution remains resolvable. These observations establish Fourier-domain quantum super-sensitivity as an operational and broadly applicable resource for precision interferometric sensing."}

For this purpose, the contributions of the electromagnetic waves with the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations to the Casimir force are computed using the Lifshitz theory expressed in terms of the pure imaginary Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions are found using an equivalent formulation of the Lifshitz theory along the real frequency axis. All computations are performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plates using the Drude model and the experimentally consistent plasma model over the separation region from 0.5 to 6~mum, where the total force value is determined by conduction electrons. It is shown that the transverse magnetic contribution to the Casimir force does not depend on the used model of the dielectric permittivity, so that the total difference between the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the measurement data is determined by the transverse electric contribution. In doing so, as opposed to the case of nonmagnetic metals, both fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in this contribution depend on the model of the dielectric permittivity used in computations, whereas the magnetic properties of the plate metal influence the Casimir force solely through the fraction of propagating waves in the transverse electric contribution. The issue of a more adequate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of magnetic metals is discussed."}

In review", "summary": "Feynman famously asserted that interference is the only real mystery in quantum mechanics (QM). It is concluded that the reason for this mystery, and thereby the related mysteries of complementarity, non-commutativity of observables, the uncertainty principle and violation of Bell's equality, is that the axioms of QM depend vitally on the continuum nature of Hilbert Space, deemed unphysical. We develop a theory of quantum physics - Rational Quantum Mechanics (RaQM) - in which Hilbert Space is gravitationally discretised. The key to solving the mysteries of QM in RaQM is a number-theoretic property of the cosine function, concealed in QM when angles range over the continuum. This number-theoretic property describes mathematically the utter indivisibility of the quantum world and implies that the laws of physics are profoundly holistic. We contrast holism with nonlocality. In theories which embrace the continuum, the violation of Bell's inequality requires the laws of physics to be either nonlocal or not realistic; both incomprehensible concepts. By contrast, holism, as embodied in Mach's Principle or in the fractal geometry of a chaotic attractor, is neither incomprehensible nor unphysical. As part of this, we solve the deepest mystery of all; why nature makes use of complex numbers."}

The asymmetry results from asymmetric coin operations, asymmetric initial states, and asymmetric polarization-dependent losses. By varying these asymmetry factors, the inverse participation ratio and entanglement entropy of the walker are numerically calculated for different coin and loss parameters, both for symmetric and asymmetric initial states. We then experimentally implement a 16-step asymmetric DTQW using a time-multiplexing fiber loop structure. By choosing an asymmetric initial state, both coin-position entanglement and delocalization are simultaneously enhanced under specific coin parameters. Moreover, we observe that with finite asymmetric polarization-dependent loss, the photon probability on the left side decreases significantly, while that on the right side increases and becomes more localized. Interestingly, under specific coin parameters, the entanglement and delocalization exhibit improved robustness against polarization-dependent loss. These results demonstrate that the DTQWs constitute an ideal platform for investigating photonic delocalization and hybrid entanglement."}

The local bound on nonlocal predictability is defined as the maximum probability with which one observer can correctly predict the other's measurement outcome prior to measurement. We show that product states always meet this bound, while all pure entangled states and some classically correlated states can exceed it. This demonstrates a nonlocal phenomenon since the predictability of measurement outcomes increases after the measurement. Perfect nonlocal predictability for arbitrary projective measurements occurs only for maximally entangled states among all pure states, underscoring their special role. Comparing pure entangled states with their dephased versions, we find that dephasing on one subsystem can enhance nonlocal predictability for a broad class of states and measurements - a counterintuitive, noise-induced advantage that vanishes for maximally entangled states under any projective measurement."}

Here, we aim to address this gap in current knowledge and consider the quantum optical HHG response from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a finite chain of atoms with both a topologically trivial and nontrivial insulating phase, the latter supporting edge states. We find that HHG from both topological phases is squeezed at the band-gap frequency. Interestingly, while the harmonic spectrum discriminates the two topological phases of the system, the degree of squeezing only discriminates the phases for smaller chain lengths. We attribute this difference to a relative increase in overlap between bulk and edge states in the topological nontrivial phase for smaller systems. Our findings reveal how the strength of dipole couplings governs the nonclassical HHG response and define new research questions on topologically protected generation of quantum light in strong-field physics."}

Main text: 10 pages", "summary": "Standard Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) struggle to scale to high-dimensional data due to the ``curse of dimensionality,'' which manifests as exponential simulation costs ($\\mathcal{O}(2^d)$) and untrainable Barren Plateaus. Existing solutions often bypass this by relying on classical neural networks for feature compression, obscuring the true quantum capability. In this work, we propose the \\textbf{Multi-Layer Fully-Connected VQC (FC-VQC)}, a modular architecture that performs \\textbf{end-to-end quantum learning} without trainable classical encoders. By restricting local Hilbert space dimensions while enabling global feature interaction via structured block mixing, our framework achieves \\textbf{linear scalability $\\mathcal{O}(d)$}. We empirically validate this approach on standard benchmarks and a high-dimensional industrial task: \\textbf{300-asset Option Portfolio Pricing}. In this regime, the FC-VQC breaks the ``Classical Ceiling,'' outperforming state-of-the-art Gradient Boosting baselines (XGBoost/CatBoost) while exhibiting \\textbf{$\\approx 17\\times$ greater parameter efficiency} than Deep Neural Networks. These results provide concrete evidence that pure, modular quantum architectures can effectively learn industrial-scale feature spaces that are intractable for monolithic ansatzes."}

We show that bosonic interactions described by certain classes of quadratic and quartic Hamiltonians can be enhanced in this way while simultaneously overcoming noise and decoherence. In general, the amplification method enhances both desired and undesired interactions present in the system. Depending on the case, however, detrimental processes can be less amplified than the desired couplings. We leverage this observation to improve the fidelity for preparing Bell-type entangled states between two bosonic modes in the presence of noise and losses. We also investigate noise models for which the protocol either fails or partially achieves a loss-tolerant state preparation speedup. Our work facilitates faster preparation of complex quantum states and implementation of entangling gates in the presence of decoherence mechanisms."}

Although demonstrated over short-range free-space links, long-distance implementations of intermodal quantum key distribution remain challenging, due to turbulence-induced wavefront aberrations which limit efficient single-mode fiber coupling at the optical receiver. Here, we demonstrate a real-time intermodal quantum key distribution field trial over an 18 km free-space link, connecting a remote terminal to an urban optical ground station equipped with a 40 cm-class telescope. An adaptive optics system, implementing direct wavefront sensing and high-order aberration correction, enables efficient single-mode fiber coupling and allows secure key generation of 200 bit/s using a compact state analyzer equipped with room-temperature detectors. We further validate through experimental data a turbulence-based model for predicting fiber coupling efficiency, providing practical design guidelines for future intermodal quantum networks."}

The dynamics is described by the Schrödinger equation on a curved spatial background and, when included, by minimal coupling to a magnetic vector potential incorporating an Aharonov--Bohm flux. After separation of variables, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional radial eigenvalue equation governed by an effective potential that combines torsion-induced Coulomb-like and centrifugal-like structures with magnetic/flux-dependent terms and optional model interactions. Because closed-form analytic solutions are not reliable over the parameter ranges required for systematic scans, we compute spectra and eigenfunctions numerically by formulating the radial equation as a self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville problem and solving it with a finite-difference discretization on a truncated radial domain, with explicit convergence control. We analyze four representative scenarios: (i) no external potential, (ii) Cornell-type confinement, (iii) Kratzer-type interaction, and (iv) the small-oscillation regime around the minimum of a Morse potential. We present systematic trends of the low-lying levels as functions of the torsion parameter, magnetic field, and azimuthal sector, and we show that geometric couplings alone can produce effective confinement even in the absence of an external interaction."}

Motivated by the effective low-rank structure that emerges after tensorization of discretized transport and diffusion dynamics, we encode PDE states as matrix product states (MPS) and represent the evolution operator as a structured low-rank matrix product operator (MPO) in tensor-train form (e.g., arising from finite-difference discretizations assembled in MPO form). The MPO is applied directly in MPS form, and rank growth is controlled via canonicalization and SVD-based truncation after each step. We provide theoretical context through standard matrix product properties, including exact MPS representability bounds, local optimality of SVD truncation, and a Lipschitz-type multi-step error propagation estimate. Experiments on one- and two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion and nonlinear viscous Burgers equations demonstrate accurate short-horizon prediction, favorable scaling in smooth diffusive regimes, and error growth in nonlinear multi-step predictions."}

We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part."}
