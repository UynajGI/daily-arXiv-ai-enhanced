This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \\geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\\in [n-1], k \\in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $π^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $λ\\mathbf 1\\{S\\times T\\}$ where $S\\subset [n], T\\subset [d]$. This model has been extensively studied. We provide an overview of the results and proof techniques for this problem with a particular emphasis on the computational lower bounds based on low-degree polynomial methods. Then, we build upon this instrumental sub-problem to discuss existing results and algorithmic ideas for the general ranking problem."}

A central element of this theory is the configurational entropy, Sc, which is traditionally represented by a symmetric Gaussian distribution. However, the asymmetric nature of the potential energy of inherent structures, Eis, poses a challenge to such a representation across wide regions of configurational space. In addition, the Gaussian distribution fails to represent fragile to strong transition, FST, observed in various fluids. In this work, we demonstrate that an asymmetric distribution, specifically the Gamma distribution, provides effective description of both Sc and Eis over broad ranges of density and temperature, T. The FST is interpreted through shifts of the Eis distribution and the curvature change of the Eis vs 1/T relation. In terms of energy changes, the FST is comparable to a liquid-liquid phase transition. Moreover, the revised PEL framework yields an equation of state that incorporates a singular term diverging at a glassy or jammed state, an important feature for accurately describing the pressure behavior of these systems."}

In particular, it is shown to be closely connected to the standard $L^2$-projection of derivatives, which possesses a super-approximation property exclusively for odd polynomial degrees. We also examine the implications of this feature for an energy-conservative Galerkin approximation of the regularized long-wave equation where the energy is a cubic functional.

Here, we examine strongly repulsive fermions on a ladder -- a minimal platform for unconventional $d$-wave pairing -- and show that flattening of the lower band through an additional diagonal hopping term produces non-Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by the violation of Luttinger's theorem, as well as axial $d$-wave pairing correlations. Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing. This offers broadly relevant insights for correlated flat-band systems, ranging from ultracold atoms to strongly interacting electrons in solids."}

Mixed models, which combine a fixed mean, expressed using independent predictors, with autocorrelated random errors, are used for inference, forecasting and filling in missing values in groundwater level time series. Estimating parameters of mixed models using maximum likelihood has high computational complexity. For large datasets, this leads to restrictive simplifying assumptions such as fixing certain free parameters in practical implementations. In this paper, we propose a method to jointly estimate all parameters of mixed models using the Whittle likelihood, a frequency-domain quasi-likelihood. Our method is robust to missing and non-Gaussian data and can handle much larger data sizes. We demonstrate the utility of our method both in a simulation study and with real-world data, comparing against maximum likelihood and an alternative two-stage approach that estimates fixed and random effect parameters separately."}

The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem.

Despite its clinical importance, CMD remains underdiagnosed due to the reliance on invasive procedures such as pressure wire-based measurements of the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), which are costly, time-consuming, and carry procedural risks. To date, no study has sought to quantify CMD indices using data-driven approaches while leveraging the rich information contained in coronary angiograms. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel data-driven framework for inference of CMD indices based on coronary angiography. A physiologically validated multi-physics model was used to generate synthetic datasets for data-driven model training, consisting of CMD indices and computational angiograms with corresponding contrast intensity profiles (CIPs). Two neural network architectures were developed: a single-input-channel encoder-MLP model for IMR prediction and a dual-input-channel encoder-MLP model for CFR prediction, both incorporating epistemic uncertainty estimation to quantify prediction confidence. Results demonstrate that the data-driven models achieve high predictive accuracy when evaluated against physics-based synthetic datasets, and that the uncertainty estimates are positively correlated with prediction errors. Furthermore, the utility of CIPs as informative surrogates for coronary physiology is demonstrated, underscoring the potential of the proposed framework to enable accurate, real-time, image-based CMD assessment using routine angiography without the need for more invasive approaches."}

We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems.

Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures."}

We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions."}

Existing approaches generally fall into two categories: (i) designs that optimize individualized sampling rules, where unit-specific probabilities are assigned and applied independently, and (ii) designs based on stratified sampling with simple random sampling within strata. Focusing on the logistic regression setting, we derive the asymptotic variances of estimators under both approaches and compare them numerically through extensive simulations and an application to data from the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic cohort. Our results reinforce that stratified sampling is not merely an approximation to individualized sampling, showing instead that optimal stratified designs are often more efficient than optimal individualized designs through their elimination of between-stratum contributions to variance. These findings suggest that optimizing over the class of individualized sampling rules overlooks highly efficient sampling designs and highlight the often underappreciated advantages of stratified sampling."}

We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that \"coprime architectures\" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary."}

This paper presents the construction of decarbonized indices for tracking the S \\& P-500 index of the U.S. stock market, as well as the Indian index NIFTY-50, employing two distinct methodologies and study their performances. These decarbonized indices optimize the portfolio weights by minimizing the mean-VaR and mean-ES and seek to reduce the risk of significant financial losses while still pursuing decarbonization goals. Investors can thereby find a balance between financial performance and environmental responsibilities. Ensuring transparency in the development of these indices will encourage the excluded and under-weighted asset companies to lower their carbon footprints through appropriate action plans.

Comments welcome", "summary": "The accelerating digitization of economic activity has made information a dominant driver of market expectations, coordination, and systemic risk. Yet contemporary monetary systems remain anchored in architectures designed for material scarcity, institutional authority, or cryptographic constraint, leaving them increasingly misaligned with information-driven economies. This conceptual paper proposes Information-Backed Currency (IBC) as a monetary framework in which verified, high-integrity information functions as the primary source of value creation and monetary stability.\n  Drawing on insights from econophysics, information theory, and cognitive economics, the paper advances the proposition that economic value emerges when information measurably reduces uncertainty within complex systems. Building on this premise, the study develops an architectural model in which currency issuance is linked to quantified entropy reduction achieved through multi-path information verification, reproducibility assessment, and contextual validation. An ethical governance layer, termed the Dharma Protocol, is introduced to ensure that only socially stabilizing, non-manipulative information qualifies as currency-backing input.\n  The proposed IBC architecture comprises four interdependent layers: information ingestion, verification and validation, ethical oversight, and monetization through a Verification Value Unit tied to uncertainty reduction. While the framework is intentionally conceptual and non-empirical, it offers a coherent blueprint for re-imagining monetary governance in an era characterized by information abundance, cognitive constraints, and systemic fragility."}

The perturbatively obtained closed-form formulae show quantitative agreement with numerical simulations of inverse participation ratios for eigenstate localization in Fock space, Edwards-Anderson parameters for spin-glass orders, mutual information for long-range entanglement, and the steady-state amplitudes of autocorrelators for period-doubled oscillations. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that eigenstate resonances render the scaling for the deviation of physical observables from their unperturbed values as $O(λ)$, in contrast to non-resonant situations with suppressed deviation $O(λ^2)$. Our scheme is based on the resolvent perturbation method that can directly prescribe arbitrarily higher-order corrections without iterations. With such advantages, we analytically prove that quasienergy corrections for pairwise cat eigenstates are identical up to order $O(λ^{(L/n_{\\text{op}})-1})$, where perturbations of strength $λ$ involve at most $n_{\\text{op}}$-spin terms. Such spectral pairing deviations quantify the DTC lifetime as $τ_* \\sim (1/λ)^{L/n_{\\text{op}}}$. Our analytical scheme applies to generic DTC models with dominant Ising interaction and a given number of qubits, which allows for independent quantification of physical observables beyond the system size accessible to numerical simulations."}

We show that in an appropriate scaling limit the lower part of the entanglement spectrum exhibits ``universality''. In the scaling limit and at asymptotically long times the distribution of the entanglement spectrum depends on two parameters that can be determined from the Rényi entropies. We show that two typical scenarios occur. In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas. We benchmark our analytical results in free-fermion chains, such as the transverse field Ising chain and the XX chain, in the rule 54 chain, and in Bethe ansatz solvable spin models."}

This study investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying epistemic self-efficacy - the perceived ability to distinguish accurate news from misinformation - across different information channels during this high-stakes election cycle. Drawing on data from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 155, September 2024, N = 9,360), we test three hypotheses: (H1) whether reliance on social media predicts lower epistemic self-efficacy compared to mainstream news sources; (H2) whether perceived exposure to inaccurate information mediates this relationship; and (H3) whether information fatigue moderates the cognitive burden of verification across platforms. Contrary to expectations rooted in algorithmic filtering theory, we find no significant differences in reported difficulty determining truth between social media and mainstream news users. Instead, epistemic burden is driven by demographics (age, education) and universal information fatigue, suggesting a \"leveling\" of the information landscape during periods of extreme volatility. This finding challenges platform-deterministic theories and suggests that interventions to support informed citizenship must address cognitive resilience and attention management rather than platform choice alone."}

We discuss OMCs from a first-principles perspective and contrast them with established semiconductor materials, highlighting key differences in their collective charge carrier dynamics. This motivates our toy model describing OMCs as a lattice gas, which we analyze within the grand canonical ensemble.

The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $α_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = α_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature.

Quarantines and lockdowns also took part in that, and so, people have been expressing their emotions throughout the pandemic period using social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. In this study, we seek to analyze the emotions and mental health labels throughout the time period of March 2, 2020, up until July 4, 2020, from the threads and comments gathered from the r/unitedkingdom subreddit. We used a soft labeling technique to generate mental health conditions for each Reddit comment. We compared the overall results with important dates related to COVID-19 policies that took place in the United Kingdom. This can give us a view on how the pandemic and the important dates affect people self disclosing their emotions on social media platforms. Finally, we have developed a proof of concept to show that using mental health features may increase emotion prediction accuracy."}

In one dimension, the information lattice provides a position- and scale-resolved decomposition of von Neumann information. Its generalization is nontrivial because overlapping subsystems can form loops, allowing multiple regions to encode the same information. This prevents information from being assigned uniquely to any one of them. We address this by introducing a higher-dimensional information lattice in which local information is defined through an inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion local information is assigned to the lattice vertices, each labeled by subsystem position and scale. We implement this construction explicitly in two dimensions and apply it to a range of many-body ground states with distinct entanglement structures. Within this position- and scale-resolved framework, we extract information-based localization lengths, direction-dependent critical exponents, characteristic edge mode information, long-range information patterns due to topological order, and signatures of non-Abelian fusion channels. Our work establishes a general information-theoretic framework for isolating the universal scale-resolved features of quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries."}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks."}

When pure Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the displacement, the leading block of the resulting algebraic system becomes almost singular in the nearly incompressible (locking) regime, hindering efficient iterative solution. To overcome this, the system is reformulated as a three-field problem with an inherent regularization that maintains the original solution while ensuring nonsingularity. Analysis shows that both the minimal residual (MINRES) and generalized minimal residual (GMRES) methods, when preconditioned with inexact block diagonal and triangular Schur complement preconditioners, achieve convergence independent of mesh size and the locking parameter for the regularized system. Similar theoretical results are established for the situation with displacement subject to mixed boundary conditions, even without regularization. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D confirm the benefits of regularization under pure Dirichlet conditions and the robustness of the preconditioners with respect to mesh size and the locking parameter in both boundary condition scenarios. Finally, a spinal cord simulation with discontinuous material parameters further illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed iterative solvers."}

We identify four magnetically ordered phases -- FM-$z$, FM-$xy$, Néel-$z$, and a two-sublattice collinear LLRR2 state -- as well as magnetically disordered/critical regimes including Néel-$xy$, LLRR1, and two Kitaev spin-liquid (KSL) regions. A topological Haldane phase also emerges near the Heisenberg limit. Our results provide evidence that both AFM- and FM-KSL regimes acquire finite parameter widths in the spin-1 model, while the Haldane phase is fragile against Kitaev-type anisotropy, particularly for $D_z<0$. Increasing (decreasing) $D_z$ suppresses (enhances) magnetic order and expands (shrinks) the KSL and other magnetically disordered sectors. Also, at $D_z=0$, we identify an exactly solvable point at $φ=\\tan^{-1}(-2)$, which enforces a first-order transition between Néel-$z$ and LLRR2. We further contrast these findings with the spin-$1/2$ KH chain and with the spin-1 honeycomb KH model, highlighting the distinct roles of dimensionality and SIA in Kitaev-type magnets."}

Apley"], "title": "Measuring Variable Importance via Accumulated Local Effects", "comment": "32 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "A shortcoming of black-box supervised learning models is their lack of interpretability or transparency. To facilitate interpretation, post-hoc global variable importance measures (VIMs) are widely used to assign to each predictor or input variable a numerical score that represents the extent to which that predictor impacts the fitted model's response predictions across the training data. It is well known that the most common existing VIMs, namely marginal Shapley and marginal permutation-based methods, can produce unreliable results if the predictors are highly correlated, because they require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that fall far outside the training data. Conditional versions of Shapley and permutation VIMs avoid or reduce the extrapolation but can substantially deflate the importance of correlated predictors. For the related goal of visualizing the effects of each predictor when strong predictor correlation is present, accumulated local effects (ALE) plots were recently introduced and have been widely adopted. This paper presents a new VIM approach based on ALE concepts that avoids both the extrapolation and the VIM deflation problems when predictors are correlated. We contrast, both theoretically and numerically, ALE VIMs with Shapley and permutation VIMs. Our results indicate that ALE VIMs produce similar variable importance rankings as Shapley and permutation VIMs when predictor correlations are mild and more reliable rankings when correlations are strong. An additional advantage is that ALE VIMs are far less computationally expensive."}

Our results include an analytical expression for the convergence rate and an explicit bound on the asymptotic identification bias, which depends on both the true system poles and the preselected model poles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pole selection algorithm is asymptotically optimal, achieving the fundamental lower bound on the identification bias. The algorithm explicitly determines the model poles as the so-called Tsuji points, and the asymptotic identification bias decreases exponentially with the number of basis functions, with the rate of decrease governed by the hyperbolic Chebyshev constant. Numerical experiments validate the derived bounds and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pole selection algorithm."}

On quantum computers, chemical dynamics can be simulated efficiently using either universal, qubit-only devices or specialized mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) simulators, which natively host electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Here, we compare the quantum resources required for a qubit-only approach to achieve the same accuracy as an MQB device at simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. We find that MQB simulations require orders-of-magnitude fewer quantum operations than qubit-only simulations, with a one-gate MQB circuit requiring a qubit-equivalent circuit volume of over 400,000 when simulating an isolated molecule, which increases to over ten million when environmental effects are included. These estimates assume perfect qubits and gates, and would increase by additional orders of magnitude if error correction were used for fault tolerance. When errors are small, the advantage of MQB simulators becomes even larger as system size increases. Our results highlight the enormous resource advantages of representing non-qubit chemical degrees of freedom natively, rather than encoding them into qubits."}

This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy."}

GADI is a framework that can represent many existing Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) methods. These methods are a class of linear solvers based on a splitting of $A$ such that the solution of the original linear system can be decomposed into the successive computation of easy-to-solve structured subsystems. Our proposed mixed precision scheme for GADI solves these subsystems in low precision to reduce the overall execution time while computing the residual and solution update in high precision to enable the solution to converge to high accuracy. We develop a rounding error analysis of mixed precision GADI that establishes the rates of convergence of the forward and backward errors to certain limiting accuracies. Our analysis also highlights the conditions on the splitting matrices under which mixed precision GADI is guaranteed to converge for a given set of precisions. We then discuss a systematic and robust strategy for selecting the GADI regularization parameter $α$, whose adjustment is critical for performance. Specifically, our proposed strategy makes use of a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model trained on a dataset of low-dimensional problems to initialize $α$. Finally, we proceed to a performance analysis of mixed precision GADI on an NVIDIA A100 GPU to validate our approach. Using low precision (Bfloat16 or FP32) to solve the subsystems, we obtain speedups of $2.6\\times$, $1.7\\times$, and $3.1\\times$ over a full double precision GADI implementation on large-scale 2D, 3D convection-diffusion and complex reaction-diffusion problems (up to $1.3\\times 10^{8}$ unknowns), respectively."}

Raman measurements were performed from 5 to 300 K to probe phonon dynamics across multiple structural and magnetic phase transitions. Our analysis reveals pronounced thermal hysteresis in phonon self-energy parameters and dynamic Raman susceptibility, confirming the first-order nature of the antipolar transition near TC1 ~ 145 K and a second-order transition near TC2 ~ 190 K. Low-frequency modes associated with Cu+ and Cr3+ ions exhibit softening and anomalous linewidth behaviour, in particular phonon mode P2 (~ 37 cm-1) showing non-monotonic temperature dependence and intensity enhancement near 60 K suggesting persistent off-centre Cu+ dynamics in the quasi-antipolar phase. The coexistence and coupling of soft phonon modes and central peaks indicate a crossover from displacive to order-disorder type transition mechanisms. Additionally, phonon anomalies below the Néel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) reflect spin-phonon coupling, linking lattice vibrations to long-range magnetic correlations. Our findings provide critical insight into the lattice instabilities, symmetry evolution, and quasiparticle interactions in CuCrP2S6, offering a deeper understanding of phase transition dynamics in two-dimensional multiferroic systems and guiding future design of magnetoelectric and spintronic devices."}

The critical gap must also exist in a person's mind and hence, together with the perceived gap, is a latent variable. Finally, it is also proposed that the critical gap is influenced by various exogenous variables such as subject and opposing vehicle types, and perceived waiting time. Mathematical models that (i) incorporate systematic and random distortions during the perception process and (ii) account for the effect of the various influencing variables are developed. The parameters of these models are estimated for two different gap acceptance data sets using the maximum likelihood technique. The data is collected as part of this study.

Finally, studies are also conducted to show that the number of rejected gaps can work as a reasonable surrogate for the influencing variable, waiting time."}

We extend this theory to variational analysis and cone-constrained dynamics by studying $K$-Lorentzian and $K$-completely log-concave polynomials over a proper convex cone $K\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$. For a $K$-Lorentzian form $f$ and $v\\in\\operatorname{int}K$, we define an open cone $K^\\circ(f,v)$ and a closed cone $K(f,v)$ via directional derivatives along $v$, recovering the usual hyperbolicity cone when $f$ is hyperbolic. We prove that $K^\\circ(f,v)$ is a proper cone and equals $\\operatorname{int}K(f,v)$. If $f$ is $K(f,v)$-Lorentzian, then $K(f,v)$ is convex and maximal among convex cones on which $f$ is Lorentzian.\n  Using the Rayleigh matrix $M_f(x)=\\nabla f(x)\\nabla f(x)^T - f(x)\\nabla^2 f(x)$, we obtain cone-restricted Rayleigh inequalities and show that two-direction Rayleigh inequalities on $K$ are equivalent to an acuteness condition for the bilinear form $v^T M_f(x) w$. This yields a cone-restricted negative-dependence interpretation linking the curvature of $\\log f$ to covariance properties of associated Gibbs measures. For determinantal generating polynomials, we identify the intersection of the hyperbolicity cone with the nonnegative orthant as the classical semipositive cone, and we extend this construction to general proper cones via $K$-semipositive cones. Finally, for linear evolution variational inequality (LEVI) systems, we show that if $q(x)=x^T A x$ is (strictly) $K$-Lorentzian, then $A$ is (strictly) $K$-copositive and yields Lyapunov (semi-)stability on $K$, giving new Lyapunov criteria for cone-constrained dynamics."}

The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion."}

Existing methods for handling left truncation mostly rely on the (quasi-)independence assumption or the weaker conditional (quasi-)independence assumption which assumes that conditional on observed covariates, the left truncation time and the event time are independent on the observed region. In practice, however, our analysis of the Honolulu Asia Aging Study (HAAS) suggests that the conditional quasi-independence assumption may fail because measured covariates often serve only as imperfect proxies for the underlying mechanisms, such as latent health status, that induce dependence between truncation and event times. To address this gap, we propose a proximal weighting identification framework that admits the dependence-inducing factors may not be fully observed. We then construct an estimator based on the framework and study its asymptotic properties. We examine the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator by comprehensive simulations, and apply it to analyzing the cognitive impairment-free survival probabilities using data from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study."}

While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors. Theoretical bounds confirm that EG-AA is no worse than standard AA, and numerical experiments demonstrate strictly improved convergence stability and rates in ill-conditioned convex composite problems compared to standard Anderson mixing."}

Among multipartite entangled states, Dicke states $|D_n^k\\rangle$ are distinguished by their permutation symmetry, which provides robustness against particle loss and enables applications for quantum communication and computation. Although Dicke states have been realized in various platforms, most optical implementations rely on postselection, which destroys the state upon detection and prevents its further use. A heralded optical scheme is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present a linear-optical heralded scheme for generating arbitrary Dicke states $|D_n^k\\rangle$ with $3n+k$ photons through the framework of the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture. By mapping the scheme design into the graph-finding problem, and exploiting the permutation symmetry of Dicke states, we overcome the structural complexity that has hindered previous approaches.

Such numerical fluxes have been recently introduced by Toro, Saggiorato, Tokareva, and Hidalgo (Journal of Computational Physics, 416, 2020), and constitute a family of centred fluxes obtained from a suitable modification of First--Order Centred (FORCE) numerical fluxes. In contrast with upwind fluxes, such as Rusanov, Harten--Lax--van Leer (HLL) or the exact Riemann solver (RS) numerical flux, centred ones do not consider in any way the structure of the Riemann problem at cell interfaces. Adopting centred numerical fluxes leads to a high level of flexibility of the resulting numerical schemes, for example in the context of complicated hyperbolic systems, for which RSs may be impossible to construct or computationally expensive.\n  The baseline framework adopted in this investigation is a FV semidiscrete approach with Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization, and results are reported up to order 7. Previous investigations involving the same framework have established that increasing the order of accuracy tends to decrease the differences in the results obtained through different numerical fluxes. The goal of this paper is to show that the employment of FORCE--$α$ numerical fluxes within such a framework is a competitive alternative to the adoption of more classical upwind fluxes. The hyperbolic system considered for this investigation is the ideal Euler equations in one and two space dimensions."}

However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator."}

While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors. Theoretical bounds confirm that EG-AA is no worse than standard AA, and numerical experiments demonstrate strictly improved convergence stability and rates in ill-conditioned convex composite problems compared to standard Anderson mixing."}

As a leading platform, neutral atom arrays rely on atomic fluorescence imaging for qubit readout, requiring short exposure, low photon count schemes to mitigate heating and atom loss while enabling mid-circuit feedback. However, a fundamental challenge arises in the single-photon regime where severe overlap in state distributions causes conventional threshold discrimination to fail. Here, we report an AI-accelerated Bayesian inference method for fluorescence readout in neutral atom arrays. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to achieve reliable state detection at the single-photon level under short exposure. Specifically, we introduce a weakly anchored Bayesian scheme that requires calibration of only one state, addressing asymmetric calibration challenges common across quantum platforms. Furthermore, acceleration is achieved via a permutation-invariant neural network, which yields a 100-fold speedup by compressing iterative inference into a single forward pass. The approach achieves relative readout fidelity above 99% and 98% for histogram overlaps of 61% and 72%, respectively, enabling reliable extraction of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference results unattainable with conventional threshold based methods. This framework supports scalable, real-time readout of large atom arrays and paves the way toward AI-enhanced quantum technology in computation and sensing."}

The perturbatively obtained closed-form formulae show quantitative agreement with numerical simulations of inverse participation ratios for eigenstate localization in Fock space, Edwards-Anderson parameters for spin-glass orders, mutual information for long-range entanglement, and the steady-state amplitudes of autocorrelators for period-doubled oscillations. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that eigenstate resonances render the scaling for the deviation of physical observables from their unperturbed values as $O(λ)$, in contrast to non-resonant situations with suppressed deviation $O(λ^2)$. Our scheme is based on the resolvent perturbation method that can directly prescribe arbitrarily higher-order corrections without iterations. With such advantages, we analytically prove that quasienergy corrections for pairwise cat eigenstates are identical up to order $O(λ^{(L/n_{\\text{op}})-1})$, where perturbations of strength $λ$ involve at most $n_{\\text{op}}$-spin terms. Such spectral pairing deviations quantify the DTC lifetime as $τ_* \\sim (1/λ)^{L/n_{\\text{op}}}$. Our analytical scheme applies to generic DTC models with dominant Ising interaction and a given number of qubits, which allows for independent quantification of physical observables beyond the system size accessible to numerical simulations."}

However, conventional methods typically lead to transient orientations characterized by periodic directional reversals and necessitate the generation of coherent superpositions across a broad spectrum of rotational states of ultracold molecules. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for achieving unidirectional field-free orientation by selectively manipulating two specific rotational states of symmetric top molecules. By leveraging the interplay between coherent superpositions and the precise selection of initial states, we demonstrate that both the maximum achievable orientation and its direction can be effectively controlled. To attain the desired two-state orientation, we present a quantum control strategy that utilizes a single control pulse, significantly simplifying the complexities of conventional multistate or multipulse schemes. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach for methyl iodide (CH$_3$I) molecules, even when accounting for molecular centrifugal distortion.The results highlight the critical roles of initial-state selection and quantum coherence in achieving long-lasting, high unidirectional molecular orientation, opening new directions in stereochemistry, precision spectroscopy, and quantum computing."}

We show that two typical scenarios occur. In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas.

One recently proposed method makes use of ancilla qubits and controlled unitary operators to implement weak measurements related to imaginary-time evolution. In this work we specialize and extend this approach to the setting of combinatorial optimization. We first generalize the algorithm from exact to approximate optimization, taking advantage of several properties unique to classical problems. In particular we show how to select parameters such that the success probability of each measurement step is bounded away from $1/2$. We then show how to adapt our paradigm to the setting of constrained optimization for a number of important classes of hard problem constraints. For this we compare and contrast both penalty-based and feasibility-preserving approaches, elucidating the significant advantages of the latter approach. Our approach is general and may be applied to easy-to-prepare initial states as a standalone algorithm, or deployed as a quantum postprocessing stage to improve performance of a given parameterized quantum circuit. We then propose a more sophisticated variant of our algorithm that adaptively applies a mixing operator or not, based on the measurement outcomes seen so far, as to speeds up the algorithm and helps the system evolution avoid slowing down or getting stuck suboptimally. In particular, we show that mixing operators from the quantum alternating operator ansatz can be imported directly, both for the necessary eigenstate scrambling operator and for initial state preparation, and discuss quantum resource tradeoffs."}

We show that, under an appropriate nonlinear small-gain condition, the overall interconnected system inherits the FxT-ISS property. In this sense, the proposed result complements existing Lyapunov-based smallgain theorems for asymptotic and finite-time stability, and enables a systematic analysis of interconnection structures exhibiting fixed-time stability.

In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $α_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = α_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $Δ_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $Δμ$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations."}

By harnessing quantum information scrambling, the protocol converts local interactions into delocalized metrologically useful correlations, enabling robust signal amplification through interference of the scrambled and polarized quantum states. We validate the time-reversal ability via Loschmidt echo measurements and quantify the information scrambling through out-of-time-ordered correlators, establishing the essential quantum resources of our protocol.

We use this to show that some squeezed multiplets are highly sensitive to perturbations in all phase-space directions, making them interesting for metrological applications."}

This is a natural generalization of a random purification channel, that transforms copies of an unknown mixed state to copies of a randomly chosen purification state. Our construction is based on the quantum Schur transform and the quantum Fourier transform over the symmetric group. By using the efficient construction of these quantum transforms, we can implement the random dilation superchannel with the circuit complexity $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n, \\log d_I, \\log d_O))$, where $n$ is the number of queries and $d_I$ and $d_O$ are the input and output dimensions of the input channel, respectively. As an application, we show an efficient storage-and-retrieval of an unknown quantum channel, which improves the program cost exponentially in the retrieval error $\\varepsilon$. For the case where the Kraus rank $r$ is the least possible (i.e., $r = d_I/d_O$), we show quantum circuits transforming $n$ parallel queries of an unknown quantum channel $Λ$ to $Θ(n^α)$ parallel queries of $Λ$ for any $α<2$ approximately, and its Petz recovery map for the reference state given by the maximally mixed state probabilistically and exactly. We also show that our results can be further extended to the case of quantum superchannels."}

Rohith"], "title": "Characterizing quantum synchronization in the van der Pol oscillator via tomogram and photon correlation", "comment": "12 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "We access the quantum synchronization (QS) in the steady state of a driven quantum van der Pol oscillator (vdPo) using two distinct figures of merit: (i) the nonclassical area $δ$ and (ii) the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$, which are both viable in experimental architectures. The nonclassical area quantifier rooted in homodyne tomography, allows us to assess the nonclassical nature of the vdPo's state directly from the tomogram without requiring full state reconstruction or the Wigner function negativity. Within a well-defined parameter regime of drive strength and detuning, both $δ$ and $g^{(2)}(0)$ exhibit pronounced signatures of synchronization that complements the phase coherence between the drive and the vdPo. We derive an analytical expression for the steady-state density matrix and the corresponding tomogram of the system, valid for arbitrary strengths of the harmonic drive. Analysis of the quantum tomogram uncovers clear phase-locking behavior, enabling the identification of the synchronization region (Arnold tongue) directly in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. Furthermore, the behaviour of $g^{(2)}(0)$ provides a statistical perspective that reinforces the tomographic signatures of QS. By analyzing the interplay between these metrics, we can gain more profound insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern QS in such systems."}

For a given arbitrary bipartite initial state and a desired bipartite target state, we construct an optimized local quantum channel that transforms the initial state into the target state with high fidelity. To achieve this goal, local quantum channels are parametrized on a complex Stiefel manifold and optimized using gradient-based methods. We demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances entanglement distillation for weakly entangled states via two complementary strategies: optimized local state transformation and probabilistic local transformation. These results establish our method as a powerful and versatile tool for a broad class of quantum information processing tasks."}

Here, we examine strongly repulsive fermions on a ladder -- a minimal platform for unconventional $d$-wave pairing -- and show that flattening of the lower band through an additional diagonal hopping term produces non-Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by the violation of Luttinger's theorem, as well as axial $d$-wave pairing correlations. Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing. This offers broadly relevant insights for correlated flat-band systems, ranging from ultracold atoms to strongly interacting electrons in solids."}

Here we extend this approach to \\emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory."}

The complete version of Abstract is shown in PDF", "summary": "Here we provide a microscopic lattice construction of excitations, fusion, and shrinking in a non-Abelian topological order by studying the three-dimensional quantum double model. We explicitly construct lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, systematically derive their fusion and shrinking rules, and demonstrate that non-Abelian shrinking channels can be controllably selected through internal degrees of freedom of loop operators. Most importantly, we show that the lattice shrinking rules obey the fusion--shrinking consistency relations predicted by twisted $BF$ field theory, providing solid evidence for the validity of field-theoretical principles developed over the past years. In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems."}

We show that in an appropriate scaling limit the lower part of the entanglement spectrum exhibits ``universality''. In the scaling limit and at asymptotically long times the distribution of the entanglement spectrum depends on two parameters that can be determined from the Rényi entropies. We show that two typical scenarios occur. In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas. We benchmark our analytical results in free-fermion chains, such as the transverse field Ising chain and the XX chain, in the rule 54 chain, and in Bethe ansatz solvable spin models."}
