Although Shor's algorithm theoretically enables polynomial-time integer factorization, its real-world performance heavily depends on stringent conditions related to the period obtained via quantum phase estimation. Our generalized decomposition method relaxes these conditions by systematically exploiting arbitrary divisors of the obtained period, effectively broadening the applicability of each quantum execution. Extensive classical simulations were performed to empirically validate our approach, involving over one million test cases across integers ranging from 2 to 8 digits. The proposed method achieved near-perfect success rates, exceeding 99.998% for 7-digit numbers and 99.999% for 8-digit numbers, significantly surpassing traditional and recently improved variants of Shor's algorithm. Crucially, this improvement is achieved without compromising the algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and integrates seamlessly with existing quantum computational frameworks. Moreover, our method enhances the efficiency of quantum resource usage by minimizing unnecessary repetitions, making it particularly relevant for quantum cryptanalysis with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study thus provides both theoretical advancements and substantial practical benefits, contributing meaningfully to the field of quantum algorithm research and the broader field of quantum information processing."}

Given computably described pure states |a>, |b> and a time-dependent unitary U(t), define the hitting time as the infimum of t > 0 such that the fidelity between U(t)|a> and |b> reaches a fixed threshold (with infinity if the threshold is never reached). We prove that there is no total algorithm that outputs this hitting time for all inputs; equivalently, the total UHTP is undecidable via a reduction from the halting problem. Operationally, we show a no-go theorem: for any fixed accuracy parameters, there is no universal finite-resource protocol that, for all computably described inputs, correctly outputs the hitting time while obeying uniform finite upper bounds on observation time and on dissipation/work. The proofs use reversible computation embedded into unitary dynamics, a fixed-target beacon construction, and a continuous-time lifting via piecewise-constant Hamiltonians. Our results target systems capable of embedding universal computation and complement prior undecidability results such as spectral-gap and quantum-control reachability. We distinguish logical time (inside the equations) from physical/operational time (of preparation, evolution, measurement), and show that universal time-step selection is impossible in both senses."}

This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters.

In this work, we introduce the Choi echo, which provides an operational interpretation of the purity of the Choi state, the state representation of a quantum channel, as a quantifier of the robustness of quantum correlations against local information erasure. We employ this framework to analyze the reduced dynamics of a subsystem and to test whether local decoherence probes quantum chaos in many-body systems. Across paradigmatic spin chain models, we show that while the Choi echo captures key dynamical features, it also exhibits intrinsic limitations that, in certain regions of parameter space, restrict its ability to resolve the integrable-to-chaos transition at the level of spectral correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that local decoherence can spuriously signal quantum chaos in integrable regimes, tracing them to the inability of a strictly local probe to distinguish efficient coherent transport from genuinely scrambling dynamics. Our results show that local decoherence signals are controlled by the entanglement generated between the probe and its environment during the dynamics, rather than by spectral correlations, clarifying the practical scope of local dynamical diagnostics."}

Analysts may misinterpret this transition as a continuation of the fundamental mode, leading to an overestimation of shear-wave velocity (Vs) in deeper layers and/or a misinterpretation of bedrock depth. Although effective-mode inversion can theoretically account for such behavior, it requires precise source-receiver geometry and cannot be applied when target dispersion data are formed by combining multiple active shots with passive-array recordings that have unknown source locations. This study introduces a predominant-mode inversion framework that addresses low-frequency mode jumps by automatically identifying, at each frequency, the Rayleigh-wave mode with the maximum vertical surface amplitude. This enables inversion without explicit mode indexing or assumptions about fundamental-mode dominance. The predominant-mode forward model is derived and implemented using the thin-layer method. The forward model is integrated into a particle-swarm-optimization global search algorithm and applied to invert three synthetic models exhibiting low-frequency mode jumps, using multiple layering parameterizations. Across all cases, the predominant-mode method accurately recovers major velocity contrasts and interface depths, whereas fundamental-mode inversions consistently overestimate Vs and mislocate deeper boundaries. The method is further validated using real field data from active and passive surface-wave measurements at the I15 Downhole Array Site. Inverted Vs profiles show strong agreement with downhole PS logs and with empirical transfer functions. Overall, the predominant-mode framework provides a robust approach for surface-wave inversion at sites with strong impedance contrasts."}

This study compares regional ice charts from the Alaska Sea Ice Program with satellite derived Copernicus sea ice concentration data to evaluate spatial and temporal discrepancies in ice representation across Alaskan waters from January 2010 to March 2025. Daily Arctic Sea Ice Program polygons were aligned with Copernicus grid points in a common UTM framework, and residuals were computed to quantify systematic differences. Results show that Copernicus consistently underestimates ice concentration relative to Arctic Sea Ice Program, particularly in nearshore and marginal ice zones affected by land-spillover and mixed-pixel effects such as those observed in Cook Inlet. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis shows that both datasets capture the same dominant physical modes of sea ice variability, with the first mode representing the annual freeze thaw cycle and the second reflecting marginal ice-zone dynamics. To assess operational implications, vessel Automatic Identification System data were combined with Alaska Sea Ice Program ice charts using the IACS POLARIS Risk Index Outcome framework. Approximately 36 percent of AIS observations within ice affected waters corresponded to negative Risk Index Outcome values, indicating that vessels frequently operated under elevated-risk conditions. These findings demonstrate that regional charts and Copernicus provide complementary capabilities that together enable more accurate and operationally meaningful Arctic navigation and risk assessments."}

Classical methods usually follow a two-stage framework: machine learning algorithms are employed to produce forecasts that closely fit the realized returns, and the predicted values are then used in a downstream portfolio optimization problem to determine the asset weights. This separation leads to a fundamental misalignment between predictions and decision outcomes, while also ignoring the impact of transaction costs. To bridge this gap, recent studies have proposed the idea of end-to-end learning, integrating the two stages into a single pipeline. This paper introduces IPMO (Integrated Prediction and Multi-period Portfolio Optimization), a model for multi-period mean-variance portfolio optimization with turnover penalties. The predictor generates multi-period return forecasts that parameterize a differentiable convex optimization layer, which in turn drives learning via portfolio performance. For scalability, we introduce a mirror-descent fixed-point (MDFP) differentiation scheme that avoids factorizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems, which thus yields stable implicit gradients and nearly scale-insensitive runtime as the decision horizon grows. In experiments with real market data and two representative time-series prediction models, the IPMO method consistently outperforms the two-stage benchmarks in risk-adjusted performance net of transaction costs and achieves more coherent allocation paths. Our results show that integrating machine learning prediction with optimization in the multi-period setting improves financial outcomes and remains computationally tractable."}

This study presents a framework for Conflict Mapping and Resolution for Sustainability of Systems (CONFARM). CONFARM consists of four steps: lifecycle documentation, cause-effect mapping, conflict database construction and multi-criteria scoring. A conflict is recorded when a single decision produces positive and negative effects across pillars. Each effect is evaluated using impact magnitude and pillar weight to generate a sustainability ratio. CONFARM may be applied manually or through automated extraction using natural-language processing and large language models. The method is demonstrated in three sectors representing different data structures and system scales: agriculture (rice and corn), fashion (slow and fast fashion) and energy (nuclear and natural gas). Each system was analysed at increasing conflict densities. Results consistently showed that sustainability scores converged as more conflicts were mapped, indicating stable evaluation across methods. Slow fashion and nuclear systems exhibited relatively higher sustainability performance, while fast fashion and natural gas systems showed lower performance. CONFARM improves early-stage decision support by making trade-offs explicit and enabling comparative evaluation. It offers a structured approach for cleaner production and scalable sustainability assessment across domains."}

Singhose", "Santosh Devasia"], "title": "Mitigating Dynamic Tip-Over during Mobile Crane Slewing using Input Shaping", "comment": "Submitted to conference", "summary": "Payload swing during rapid slewing of mobile cranes poses a safety risk, as it generates overturning moments that can lead to tip-over accidents of mobile cranes. Currently, to limit the risk of tip-over, mobile crane operators are forced to either reduce the slewing speed (which lowers productivity) or reduce the load being carried to reduce the induced moments. Both of these approaches reduce productivity. This paper seeks to enable rapid slewing without compromising safety by applying input shaping to the crane-slewing commands generated by the operator. A key advantage of this approach is that the input shaper requires only the information about the rope length, and does not require detailed mobile crane dynamics. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method reduces residual payload swing and enables significantly higher slewing speeds without tip over, reducing slewing completion time by at least 38% compared to unshaped control. Human control with input shaping improves task completion time by 13%, reduces the peak swing by 18%, and reduces the potential of collisions by 82% when compared to unshaped control. Moreover, shaped control with a human had no tip-over, whereas large swing led to tip-over without input shaping. Thereby, the proposed method substantially recovers the operational-safety envelope of mobile cranes (designed to avoid tip-over using static analysis) that would otherwise be lost in dynamic conditions.

In this direction, space-time correlations between avalanches have proven to be especially difficult to access. One of the main obstacle to do so comes from taking memory effects in a systematic way along the computation. In this paper, we partially fill this gap and derive recursive relations for the particle filling and avalanche 2-points correlation function in the 1D Directed Stochastic Sandpile. These expressions allow to characterize the sign of the correlations and estimates are provided in the particle filling case. In fact, density correlations are shown to be positively correlated. This behavior is directly related to persistence of the local particle filling. On the other hand, we show that avalanches are anticorrelated in the model. This is interpreted by the fact that avalanches disrupt the system and the damage can only be fully compensated after injecting a sufficiently high number of particles. These results indicate an underlying trade off, between static and dynamic observable, for the system to sit in its stationary state. It appears that this balance is controlled by the conservation of the particle number along the avalanches."}

Two complementary measures are introduced: the mutual information energy, a state-independent quantity inspired by Onicescu's information energy that captures the geometric overlap between joint eigenspaces within a context; and an operational measure based on commutator expectation values that reflects contextual behavior at the level of measurement outcomes. We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states."}

However, resolving these parameters for small-magnitude earthquakes remains challenging due to small rupture sizes, short durations, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we utilized a dense array of nodal seismometers in the Changning region, Sichuan Basin, China, to study the focal mechanism and rupture directivity of aftershocks following the 2019 Ms 6.0 induced earthquake. Using PhaseNet+ and SKHASH, we first enhance the focal mechanism catalog (1<M<4). Then, applying the spectral ratio method with empirical Green's functions (EGF), we observe azimuth-dependent corner frequencies of two M3 aftershocks, by spectral fitting to the Brune's model, which are consistent with unilateral rupture. Our results reveal that the two earthquakes occurred at an unidentified conjugate fault and ruptured towards N60°E unilaterally, which significantly differs from the northwestward rupture of the MS 6.0 mainshock. Furthermore, we obtain a rupture speed of approximately 0.6 times the shear wave velocity. We also apply the spectral decomposition method to compute stress drops (M>1), and their spatial variability reflects a long-term interplay between fluid injection and faults in the salt-mining area. These findings illuminate a complex fault system beneath the Changning anticline and highlight the importance of high-resolution seismic arrays in resolving rupture processes of small-magnitude events."}

Moreover, the functionality of directed networks depends on the giant strongly connected component (GSCC), where nodes are mutually reachable. Considering both the directionality and heterogeneity of these networks, we propose a novel centrality measure, network incoherence (NI) centrality, and develop a trophic analysis-based dismantling (TAD) method, in which nodes are removed in descending order according to their NI centrality scores, aiming to efficiently dismantle directed networks by reducing the GSCC. When applied to a wide range of benchmark synthetic networks with varying degree heterogeneity and 15 real-world directed networks, our TAD method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Significantly, TAD also induces the largest maximum avalanches during the dismantling process, highlighting its ability to capture structurally critical nodes.

Likelihood maximization drives this system toward nonequilibrium steady states with finite entropy production, reduced self-transition probabilities, and persistent probability currents in the latent space. These cycles are not imposed by the architecture but arise from training, and models that develop them avoid the low-log-likelihood regime associated with nearly reversible dynamics while more faithfully reproducing the empirical distribution of data classes. Compared with equilibrium approaches such as restricted Boltzmann machines, our model breaks the detailed balance between the forward and backward conditional transitions and relies on a log-likelihood gradient that depends explicitly on the last two steps of the Markov chain.

The history of the current passing through the coil is remembered by the magnetization inside the magnetic core. Such a meminductor can play a unique role (that cannot be played by a memristor) in neuromorphic computing, deep learning and brain inspired since the time constant of a neuromorphic RLC circuit is jointly determined by the inductance and capacitance, rather than the resistance.

Designed as a drop-in replacement for the linear algebra routines in existing R-matrix codes, HPRMAT employs direct linear equation solving with optimized libraries instead of traditional matrix inversion, achieving significant performance improvements. The package provides four solver backends: (1) double-precision LU factorization, (2) mixed-precision arithmetic with iterative refinement, (3) a Woodbury formula approach exploiting the kinetic-coupling matrix structure, and (4) GPU acceleration. Benchmark calculations demonstrate that the GPU solver achieves up to 9$\\times$ speedup over optimized CPU direct solvers, and 18$\\times$ over legacy inversion-based codes, for large matrices ($N=25600$). The mixed-precision strategy is particularly effective on consumer GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090), where single-precision throughput exceeds double-precision by a factor of 64:1; by performing factorization in single precision with iterative refinement, HPRMAT overcomes the poor FP64 performance of consumer hardware while maintaining double-precision accuracy.

The risk preferences are characterized by a family of risk measures, called Range Value-at-Risk (RVaR), which includes both Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) as special cases. Recognizing the practical difficulty of accurately estimating the dependence structure among the insurers' losses, we adopt a robust optimization approach that assumes the marginal distributions are known while leaving the dependence structure unspecified. We provide a complete characterization of optimal indemnity schedules under the worst-case scenario, showing that the infinite-dimensional optimization problem can be reduced to a tractable finite-dimensional problem involving only two or three parameters for each indemnity function. Additionally, for independent and identically distributed risks, we exploit the argument of asymptotic normality to derive optimal two-parameter layer contracts. Finally, numerical applications are considered in a two-insurer setting to illustrate the influence of the dependence structures and heterogeneous risk tolerances on optimal strategies and the corresponding risk evaluation."}

Many studies have proposed the use of deep learning for processing; however, most of them are limited by factors such as seismic wavelets and low-frequency initial models. Furthermore, self-supervised frameworks constructed entirely using deep learning models struggle to form direct and effective physical constraints to unlabeled outputs during the multi-model concatenation, which leads to instability in inversion. In this work, we introduced innovations in both the deep learning framework and training strategy. First, we designed a deep learning framework to perform acoustic impedance inversion and seismic wavelet extraction simultaneously. Building on this foundation, considering the scarcity of well data, we proposed a physics-informed cross-learning strategy to impose effective constraints on the framework. We conducted comparative experiments and ablation experiments on both synthetic datasets and field datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement compared with semi-supervised learning methods and can extract seismic wavelets with relatively high accuracy.

Micromobility users, whose numbers have increased rapidly in recent years, are particularly vulnerable to outdoor heat exposure. Yet, their exposure patterns and the effectiveness of mitigation measures remain poorly understood. Here, we couple a high-resolution urban microclimate model (WRF--BEP--SOLWEIG) with 4.76 million Citi Bike trips in New York City to quantify cyclists' thermal exposure during the June 2024 heatwave and to evaluate targeted cooling strategies. Results show that a small fraction of the street network concentrates the majority of rider heat exposure, and that localized interventions along these segments yield the greatest benefits. Targeted tree planting along just 1.5% of the city's street network reduces total heat-exposed kilometers ridden by 19%, equivalent to a thermal stress reduction of about 4°C, with its impact maximized during midday hours. In contrast, randomized citywide tree planting produces diffuse, resource-intensive cooling, highlighting the superior efficiency of spatially prioritized interventions. Baseline results further indicate that daytime heat stress is higher in lower-income neighborhoods, adding an important social dimension of urban heat exposure. Together, these findings provide a quantitative basis for designing heat-resilient and equitable cycling networks in a warming climate."}

First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems."}

However, this task faces a fundamental challenge when the governing equations are unknown and observational data are sparse. System stiffness, the coupling of multiple time-scales, further exacerbates this problem and hinders long-term prediction. Existing methods fall short: purely data-driven methods demand massive datasets, whereas physics-aware approaches are constrained by their reliance on known equations and fine-grained time steps. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an equation-free learning framework, namely, the Stable Spectral Neural Operator (SSNO), for modeling stiff partial differential equation (PDE) systems based on limited data. Instead of encoding specific equation terms, SSNO embeds spectrally inspired structures in its architecture, yielding strong inductive biases for learning the underlying physics. It automatically learns local and global spatial interactions in the frequency domain, while handling system stiffness with a robust integrating factor time-stepping scheme. Demonstrated across multiple 2D and 3D benchmarks in Cartesian and spherical geometries, SSNO achieves prediction errors one to two orders of magnitude lower than leading models. Crucially, it shows remarkable data efficiency, requiring only very few (2--5) training trajectories for robust generalization to out-of-distribution conditions. This work offers a robust and generalizable approach to learning stiff spatiotemporal dynamics from limited data without explicit \\textit{a priori} knowledge of PDE terms."}

When only of these noises are considered, the LQC strategy leads to stochastic or robust controllers, respectively. However, there is no LQC strategy that can simultaneously handle stochastic and bounded noises efficiently. This limits the scope where existing LQC strategies can be applied. In this work, we look into the LQC problem for discrete-time systems that have both stochastic and bounded noises in its dynamics. We develop a state estimation for such systems by efficiently combining a Kalman filter and an ellipsoid set-membership filter. The developed state estimation can recover the estimation optimality when the system is subject to both kinds of noise, the stochastic and the bounded. Upon the estimated state, we derive a robust state-feedback optimal control law for the LQC problem. The control law derivation takes into account both stochastic and bounded-state estimation errors, so as to avoid over-conservativeness while sustaining stability in the control. In this way, the developed LQC strategy extends the range of scenarios where LQC can be applied, especially those of real-world control systems with diverse sensing which are subject to different kinds of noise. We present numerical simulations, and the results demonstrate the enhanced control performance with the proposed strategy."}

Currently, to limit the risk of tip-over, mobile crane operators are forced to either reduce the slewing speed (which lowers productivity) or reduce the load being carried to reduce the induced moments. Both of these approaches reduce productivity. This paper seeks to enable rapid slewing without compromising safety by applying input shaping to the crane-slewing commands generated by the operator. A key advantage of this approach is that the input shaper requires only the information about the rope length, and does not require detailed mobile crane dynamics. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method reduces residual payload swing and enables significantly higher slewing speeds without tip over, reducing slewing completion time by at least 38% compared to unshaped control. Human control with input shaping improves task completion time by 13%, reduces the peak swing by 18%, and reduces the potential of collisions by 82% when compared to unshaped control. Moreover, shaped control with a human had no tip-over, whereas large swing led to tip-over without input shaping. Thereby, the proposed method substantially recovers the operational-safety envelope of mobile cranes (designed to avoid tip-over using static analysis) that would otherwise be lost in dynamic conditions.

First, for pure Gaussian states, we show that every correlated mode possesses a unique single-degree-of-freedom partner that fully captures its correlations (consisting of entanglement), and we provide an explicit construction of this partner from the complex structure of the system's state. Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems. Together, these results provide conceptual practical tools to study how bipartite correlations and entanglement are structured and where they can be found in complex Gaussian many-body systems."}

We find a global glacier volume of $(149 \\pm 38)\\times 10^3$ km$^3$, consistent with the previous ensemble estimate of $(147 \\pm 28)\\times 10^3$ km$^3$. The corresponding sea-level equivalent, $323 \\pm 91$ mm, is likewise consistent with the earlier value of $315 \\pm 63$ mm. Compared to measurements, IceBoost error is 20-45% lower than the other solutions in the high Arctic, highlighting the value of machine-learning approaches. Confidence in our solution is highest at higher latitudes. Over mountainous terrain, small glaciers, and under-represented lower-latitude regions, confidence is lower. IceBoost v2.0 demonstrates strong generalization at ice sheet margins. On the Geikie Plateau (East Greenland), we find nearly twice as much ice as previously reported, highlighting the method's potential to infer bed topography in parts of the ice sheets. The quality of the solutions depends on the accuracy of the training data, the Digital Elevation Model, ice velocity fields, and glacier geometries, including nunataks. Using the Jensen Gap, we probe the model's curvature with respect to input errors and find it is strongly concave over low-slope, thick-ice regions, implying a potential downward bias in predicted thickness under input uncertainty.

First, we suggest the convex relaxation technique to transform the maximum frequency deviation constraint to facilitate optimization. Then, an evolution-based robust dispatch framework is introduced to align day-ahead decisions with intraday strategies, ensuring both frequency security and power supply reliability.

For an open system described by the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF), we show that the equilibrium free energy difference between two canonical endpoints can be written as exponential averages of the HMF shift, divided by an explicit factor built from the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final system marginals. These relations hold at the endpoint level and, under an asymptotic equilibration postulate, admit trajectory representations for general driving and coupling protocols. A decomposition of the HMF increment along each trajectory separates the work-like contributions associated with changes in $λ(t)$ and $C(t)$, the heat-like exchange with the environment, and a feedback-like functional defined with respect to the initial protocol. In the frozen-driving regime with a noninteracting reference, the equalities reduce to new FEP-like expressions involving an environment functional and an explicit overlap correction, with the Zwanzig formula recovered as a limiting case. We validate the approach on an open system coupled to an environment and evolved under overdamped Langevin dynamics, where conventional Zwanzig FEP suffers from poor phase-space overlap and slow numerical convergence, while the present trajectory equality closely matches the exact free energy difference over a broad range of coupling strengths."}

Unfortunately, the implementation of filters for nonlinear, possibly high-dimensional, dynamical systems is far from straightforward, as computational methods have to meet a delicate trade-off involving stability, accuracy and computational cost. In this paper we investigate the design, and theoretical features, of constrained Bayesian filters for state space models. The constraint on the filter is given by a sequence of compact subsets of the state space that determines the sources and targets of the Markov transition kernels in the dynamical model. Subject to such constraints, we provide sufficient conditions for filter stability and approximation error rates with respect to the original (unconstrained) Bayesian filter. Then, we look specifically into the implementation of constrained filters in a continuous-discrete setting where the state of the system is a continuous-time stochastic Itô process but data are collected sequentially over a time grid. We propose an implementation of the constraint that relies on a data-driven modification of the drift of the Itô process using barrier functions, and discuss the relation of this scheme with methods based on the Doob $h$-transform.

In particular, we find that assortativity often prevails regardless of the interaction sign and that core-periphery structures are typical in online social networks. Our findings highlight the complexity of meso-scale relational structures, the importance of using computational methods that are a priori agnostic to specific patterns, and the importance of independently evaluating micro- and meso-scale predictions of social balance theory."}

In this work, we develop a resource-theoretic framework to do so. Here, we focus on the simplest nontrivial setting -- two variables that are causally ordered, meaning that the first has the potential to influence the second, without hidden confounding. First, we introduce the resource theory that directly quantifies causal influence of a functional dependence in this setting and show that the problem of deciding convertibility of resources and identifying a complete set of monotones has a relatively straightforward solution. Following this, we introduce the resource theory that arises naturally when one has uncertainty about the functional dependence. We describe a linear program for deciding the question of whether one resource (i.e., state of knowledge about the functional dependence) can be converted to another. Then, we focus on the case where the variables are binary. In this case, we identify a triple of monotones that are complete in the sense that they capture the partial order over the set of all resources, and we provide an interpretation of each."}

Conversely, topological data analysis (TDA) methods such as ToMATo are powerful in identifying density-defined clusters in embedded data but can be sensitive to initial projection. We propose a unified framework that integrates both paradigms to take advantage of their complementary advantages. Our method uses spectral embedding to capture the network's geometric skeleton, creating a landscape where communities manifest as density basins. The ToMATo algorithm then provides a topologically-grounded and parameter-aware method to extract persistent clusters from this landscape. Our comprehensive analysis across synthetic benchmarks shows that this hybrid approach is highly robust: it performs on par with Louvain on modular networks.

Here we perform a systematic study by doping non-magnetic Mg2+ into a magnetically complicated system, Co10Ge3O16, which contains three frustrated sublattices of Co2+, e.g., triangular Co1, Kagome Co2 and Co3 sublattices. By growing crystals for (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 < x <= 30%), we observed obvious site preference of Mg2+ on Co1 and Co3 sites over the Co2 site. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the high purity of the samples and indicate systematic peak shift, consistent with the loading compositions. Although previously investigated, the magnetic structure and expected magnetic frustration in this system are not fully uncovered. Our temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that the high-temperature magnetostructural phase transition with antiferromagnetic ordering and a low-temperature broad peak are suppressed with Mg2+ doping, while two new magnetic features emerge at high Mg2+ level. Moreover, the structural phase transition from high-temperature R-3m to low-temperature C2/m space group is absent at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, as confirmed by single-crystal XRD. By analyzing the heat capacity and neutron powder diffraction results of the highest doped sample, (Co0.7Mg0.3)10Ge3O16, we speculate that the Co1 site is responsible for the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, while the other two sites are short-range correlated in addition to a Mg2+-induced spin-glass state. This study provides more insights into the complex magnetism in Co10Ge3O16 by using the non-magnetic Mg2+ as a probe.

Furthermore, many measures found in the literature do not accurately represent the physical or probabilistic characteristics of nodal centrality, network flow, and other salient properties. For example, recurrent spreading in a network is often overlooked by these metrics. Standard centrality measures have limitations, being optimal for one application but not for others. Here, we present new metrics based on our influence spreading model to characterize network structure for various network science applications. These probabilistic measures account for all feasible walks and cycles in the network. We compare our new metrics with the standard metrics in terms of the node rankings given by different centrality measures, by examining scatter plots, and by using the Pearson correlation coefficient. In the influence spreading model, we define the in-centrality measure to characterize how central a node is as a target of influence by other nodes and the out-centrality measure to characterize how central a node is as a source of influence on other nodes. Our results show that the influence spreading betweenness centrality reveals the importance of alternative routes while maintaining similarity to standard betweenness centrality."}

In recent years, methodological advancements led to the multiloop extension of the fRG, which systematically includes loop corrections beyond the conventional one-loop truncation and yields a quantitatively accurate description of two-dimensional lattice systems. At the same time, the single-boson exchange (SBE) decomposition of the two-particle vertex has been shown to offer both computational and interpretative advantages paving the way to more affordable approximation schemes. We here apply their combination coined as multiloop SBE fRG to the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling. After providing a detailed account of the underlying formalism in physical channels, we analyze the results for the frequency- and momentum-dependent vertex functions. We find that the SBE approximation, i.e., without calculating explicitly multi-boson exchange contributions, accurately reproduces the parquet approximation at loop convergence. The presented algorithmic improvement opens the route for the treatment of more challenging parameter regimes and more realistic models."}

Our approach transforms computational timing variations from hardware and operating system sources into permutation dynamics that generate Poisson-distributed numbers, accurately reproducing the photon statistics of optical coherent states. The theoretical foundation is established by the Uniform Convergence Theorem, which provides exponential convergence to uniformity under modular projection with rigorous error bounds. Extensive experimental validation across multiple parameter regimes and sample sizes up to $10^8$ bytes demonstrates exceptional performance: Shannon entropy approaching 7.999998 bits/byte and min-entropy exceeding 7.99 bits/byte, outperforming theoretical bounds at scale. The architecture inherently resists side-channel attacks through compound timing distributions and adaptive permutation behavior, while operating without classical cryptographic post-processing. Our results establish that coherent-state QRNG functionality can be entirely realized through classical computational processes, delivering mathematically provable uniformity and practical cryptographic security without quantum photonic hardware."}

We introduce Causal Judge Evaluation (CJE), a framework that fixes all three failures. On n=4,961 Chatbot Arena prompts (after filtering from 5k), CJE achieves 99% pairwise ranking accuracy at full sample size (94% averaged across configurations), matching oracle quality, at 14x lower cost (for ranking 5 policies) by calibrating a 16x cheaper judge on just 5% oracle labels (~250 labels). CJE combines three components: (i) AutoCal-R, reward calibration via mean-preserving isotonic regression; (ii) SIMCal-W, weight stabilization via stacking of S-monotone candidates; and (iii) Oracle-Uncertainty Aware (OUA) inference that propagates calibration uncertainty into confidence intervals. We formalize the Coverage-Limited Efficiency (CLE) diagnostic, which explains why IPS-style estimators fail even when ESS exceeds 90%: the logger rarely visits regions where target policies concentrate. Key findings: SNIPS inverts rankings even with reward calibration (38% pairwise, negative Kendall's tau) due to weight instability; calibrated IPS remains near-random (47%) despite weight stabilization, consistent with CLE; OUA improves coverage from near-0% to ~86% (Direct) and ~96% (stacked-DR), where naive intervals severely under-cover."}

Using ~650 million Google Places reviews to measure co-visitation between U.S. ZIP codes and ~30 million Canadian change-of-address to track residential mobility, results show that neighborhoods with similar cultural styles and amenities are significantly more connected. These effects persist even after controlling for race, income, education, politics, housing costs, and distance. Urban cohesion and segregation depend not only on who lives where or how far apart neighborhoods are, but on the shared cultural and material ecologies that structure movement across the city."}

We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data.

To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium."}

However, pedestrians can become occluded by vehicles or infrastructure, creating significant safety risks due to limited visibility. Vehicle-to-everything communication enables the sharing of perception data between connected road-users, allowing for a more comprehensive awareness. The main challenge is how to fuse perception data when measurements are inconsistent with the true locations of pedestrians. Inconsistent measurements can occur due to sensor noise, false positives, or communication issues. This paper employs set-based estimation with constrained zonotopes to compute a confidence metric for the measurement set from each sensor. These sets and their confidences are then fused using hybrid zonotopes. This method can account for inconsistent measurements, enabling reliable and robust fusion of the sensor data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in both simulation and real experiments."}

We prove that when the regularization parameter is larger than a threshold, the regularized problem is equivalent to the original problem: they share identical local and global minima, and all Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the regularized problem are feasible assignment matrices. To solve the regularized problem approximately and efficiently, we adopt the variable splitting technique, and solve it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, in which all subproblems admit closed-form solutions.

Deconvolution of this data is an ill-posed problem and regularisation is required to provide feasible solutions. Deconvolution with regularisation is applied to a synthetic feed consisting of particles of constant density that vary in size only.

In this article, we propose a novel wavelet domain technique that allows the data-driven inference of the (sparse) conditional independence graph of a high-dimensional stationary multivariate time series.

This process naturally induces a Sobolev energy metric that incorporates physical information, effectively mitigating stiffness during optimization. To address the explicit dependence on the normalization constant caused by the nonlinear interaction term in the GPE, we design a hybrid sampling strategy combining an integration stream and a MCMC stream to achieve precise estimation of the generalized Gram matrix and energy gradients. Numerical experiments on benchmark cases, including the harmonic oscillator potential in the strong interaction limit and multi-scale optical lattice potentials, demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed method. Furthermore, it achieves an order-of-magnitude acceleration in convergence compared to standard optimizers like Adam, exhibiting superior robustness in handling strong nonlinearities and complex geometric constraints."}

Although many mitigation strategies exist, their connection to convergence performance under different iteration budgets remains unclear. Moreover, a systematic analysis identifying which state-of-the-art mitigation techniques perform best under specific scenarios is also lacking. We benchmark four approaches, Local-Global, Adiabatic, State Efficient Ansatz (SEA), and Pretrained VQE, against standard VQE on molecular systems from 4 to 14 qubits, analyzing gradient variance up to 50 layers and convergence over 1000 iterations. Our results show that the impact of gradient preservation is iteration-dependent. In the 14-qubit BeH2 system, Pretrained VQE outperforms SEA at 100 iterations despite lower gradient variance, but SEA becomes 2.2x more accurate at 1000 iterations. For smaller systems, SEA achieves near-exact energies (H2: 10^-5 Ha, LiH: 2x10^-4 Ha) with fidelities 0.999, while standard methods plateau early.

However, most existing studies assume unlimited public transit capacity or a fixed occupancy of shared modes, often neglecting waiting time and oversimplifying time-based costs by depending solely on in-vehicle travel time. These assumptions can overstate the system's performance with TCS regulation, especially when there are insufficient public or shared transport supplies.\n  To address this, we develop a dynamic multimodal equilibrium model to capture operation constraints and induced waiting times under TCS regulation. The model integrates travelers' mode choices, credit trading, traffic dynamics, and waiting time, which depend on key operational features of service vehicles such as fleet size and capacity.\n  Besides, most TCS studies assume fixed transport supply, overlooking supply-side responses triggered by demand shifts. Therefore, we further propose integrating adaptive supply management through the deployment of Demand-Responsive Autonomous Shuttles (DRAS) and developing a bi-level optimization framework that incorporates the equilibrium model to jointly optimize TCS design and operational strategies for the DRAS.\n  We apply the framework to a section of the A10 highway near Paris, France, to examine demand-supply interactions and assess the potential benefits of jointly implementing TCS and DRAS. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of modeling operational features within multimodal equilibrium and incorporating flexible supply in TCS policies for mitigating overall generalized cost."}

Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations."}

Although BART allows us to model complex functional relationships, it tends to suffer from overfitting. In this article, we exploit a loss-based prior for the tree topology that is designed to reduce the tree complexity. In addition, we propose a novel adaptive Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that is ergodic in nature and requires very few assumptions allowing us to model complex and non-smooth likelihood functions with ease. Moreover, we show that our method can efficiently recover the true tree structure and approximate a complex conditional copula parameter, and that our adaptive routine can explore the true likelihood region under a sub-optimal proposal variance.

The main challenge is how to fuse perception data when measurements are inconsistent with the true locations of pedestrians. Inconsistent measurements can occur due to sensor noise, false positives, or communication issues. This paper employs set-based estimation with constrained zonotopes to compute a confidence metric for the measurement set from each sensor. These sets and their confidences are then fused using hybrid zonotopes. This method can account for inconsistent measurements, enabling reliable and robust fusion of the sensor data.

Due to the irregular nature of the grid, we use a novel meshless MUSCL-like Moving Least Squares Method (MLS) for spatial discretisation coupled with a higher-order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta method. To avoid spurious oscillations at discontinuities, we use the so-called Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) method with an adapted criterion to relax the discrete maximum property.

Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials."}

The evolution governed by the Liouville operator preserves many properties of full quantum dynamics, including the conservation of total population, energy, and purity, and has shown quantitative agreement with exact quantum results for the expectation values of many observables where direct comparisons are feasible. However, since the QCLE density matrix operator is obtained from the partial Wigner transform of the full quantum density matrix, its matrix elements can have negative values, implying that the diagonal matrix elements behave as pseudo-densities rather than densities of classical phase space. Here, we compare phase-space distributions generated by exact quantum dynamics with those produced by QCLE evolution from pure quantum initial states. We show that resonance effects in the off-diagonal matrix elements differ qualitatively, particularly for low-energy states. Furthermore, numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models reveal that the QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, a property that should hold at all times for any physical system. A perturbative analysis of a model system confirms that such violations arise generically. We also show that the violations of positivity of the marginal densities vanish as the initial energy of the system increases relative to the energy gap between subsystem states. These findings suggest that a negativity index, quantifying deviations from positivity, may provide a useful metric for assessing the validity of mixed quantum\\textendash{}classical descriptions."}

Still, in such a formulation, as the number of vehicles involved increases, the computational complexity increases significantly. To address this, we propose two algorithms for near-optimal local optimization that significantly reduce the computational complexity by decomposing the high-dimensional problem into a sequence of 2D graph search problems.

We consider the ramped and periodically-driven Falicov-Kimball and Hubbard models within time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory. Although we observe that several iterative methods yield stable convergence at large propagation times, a standard forward fixed point iteration does not. We find that the number of iterations required to converge to a given accuracy with a fixed time step size scales roughly linearly with the number of time steps.

The theory is extended to a discrete-time analogue, establishing that this geometric structure and its resonant behavior persist in sampled systems. A closed-form analysis of a sphere--plane example demonstrates that curvature can be inferred directly from the LEDR evolution. This framework provides a unified geometric interpretation of structured error dynamics and offers foundational tools for curvature-informed model validation."}

What these frameworks have in common is that they all make assumptions for point identifications that can be violated even when treatment is randomized. When a causal effect is not point-identified, one can sometimes derive bounds, i.e. a range of possible values that are consistent with the observed data. In this work, we study causal bounds for mediation effects under both the natural effects framework and the separable effects framework. In particular, we show that when there are unmeasured confounders for the intermediate variables(s) the sharp symbolic bounds on separable (in)direct effect coincide with existing bounds for natural (in)direct effects in the analogous setting. We compare these bounds to valid bounds for the natural direct effects when only the cross-world independence assumption does not hold. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use and compare the results of the bounds on data from a trial investigating the effect of peanut consumption on the development of peanut allergy in infants through specific pathways of measured immunological biomarkers."}

However, most existing studies assume unlimited public transit capacity or a fixed occupancy of shared modes, often neglecting waiting time and oversimplifying time-based costs by depending solely on in-vehicle travel time. These assumptions can overstate the system's performance with TCS regulation, especially when there are insufficient public or shared transport supplies.\n  To address this, we develop a dynamic multimodal equilibrium model to capture operation constraints and induced waiting times under TCS regulation. The model integrates travelers' mode choices, credit trading, traffic dynamics, and waiting time, which depend on key operational features of service vehicles such as fleet size and capacity.\n  Besides, most TCS studies assume fixed transport supply, overlooking supply-side responses triggered by demand shifts. Therefore, we further propose integrating adaptive supply management through the deployment of Demand-Responsive Autonomous Shuttles (DRAS) and developing a bi-level optimization framework that incorporates the equilibrium model to jointly optimize TCS design and operational strategies for the DRAS.\n  We apply the framework to a section of the A10 highway near Paris, France, to examine demand-supply interactions and assess the potential benefits of jointly implementing TCS and DRAS. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of modeling operational features within multimodal equilibrium and incorporating flexible supply in TCS policies for mitigating overall generalized cost."}

In condensed matter physics, vigorous research has clarified how chiral materials harbour unconventional electronic and vibrational responses. In parallel, recent studies have demonstrated that chiral structures can be engineered or tuned from achiral precursors. Despite these complementary advances, an integrated understanding of electronic and phononic dynamics, self-organized chiral structures, and their interplay is still lacking. Such an integrated framework is crucial both for elucidating the spontaneous formation and stabilization of chiral structures and for advancing the electronic functionalities of chiral materials. Here, we predict novel spontaneous structural phase transitions unique to chiral crystals with screw symmetry. In quasi-one-dimensional chiral crystals, the phonon frequency renormalized by the electron-phonon coupling depends on the handedness of circular polarization. Consequently, the soft mode encoding the intrinsic phonon angular momentum induces spin-selective Peierls gaps in the electronic band, entailing a helical spin density wave and chiral lattice distortion. We also elucidate the chiral signature of collective modes. Our findings offer new avenues for advanced spintronics applications and crucial insights into the elusive mechanisms underlying the formation process of chirality in nature."}

Still, in such a formulation, as the number of vehicles involved increases, the computational complexity increases significantly.

In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\\mathbf{q}\\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state."}

However, existing graphical models focus primarily on undirected graphs or directed acyclic graphs, limiting their ability to capture feedback loops that are prevalent in gene regulation. Moreover, ensuring the so-called stability condition of cyclic graphs, while allowing graph structures to vary continuously with spatial covariates, presents significant statistical and computational challenges. We propose BNP-DCGx, a Bayesian nonparametric approach for learning spatially varying gene regulatory networks via covariate-dependent directed cyclic graphical models. Our method introduces a covariate-dependent random partition as an intermediary layer in a hierarchical model, which discretizes the covariate space into clusters with cluster-specific stable directed cyclic graphs. Through partition averaging, we obtain smoothly varying graph structures over space while maintaining theoretical guarantees of stability. We develop an efficient parallel tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference and demonstrate through simulations that our method accurately recovers both piecewise constant and continuously varying graph structures. Application to spatial transcriptomics data from human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reveals spatially varying regulatory networks with feedback loops, identifies potential cell subtypes within established cell types based on distinct regulatory mechanisms, and provides new insights into spatial organization of gene regulation in brain tissue."}

When only of these noises are considered, the LQC strategy leads to stochastic or robust controllers, respectively. However, there is no LQC strategy that can simultaneously handle stochastic and bounded noises efficiently. This limits the scope where existing LQC strategies can be applied. In this work, we look into the LQC problem for discrete-time systems that have both stochastic and bounded noises in its dynamics. We develop a state estimation for such systems by efficiently combining a Kalman filter and an ellipsoid set-membership filter. The developed state estimation can recover the estimation optimality when the system is subject to both kinds of noise, the stochastic and the bounded. Upon the estimated state, we derive a robust state-feedback optimal control law for the LQC problem. The control law derivation takes into account both stochastic and bounded-state estimation errors, so as to avoid over-conservativeness while sustaining stability in the control. In this way, the developed LQC strategy extends the range of scenarios where LQC can be applied, especially those of real-world control systems with diverse sensing which are subject to different kinds of noise.

Kernel balancing is a promising approach that first estimates a kernel that captures similarity across units and then balances a (possibly low-dimensional) summary of that kernel, indirectly learning important features to balance. In this paper, we propose forest kernel balancing, which leverages the underappreciated fact that tree-based machine learning models, namely random forests and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), implicitly estimate a kernel based on the co-occurrence of observations in the same terminal leaf node. Thus, even though the resulting kernel is solely a function of baseline features, the selected nonlinearities and other interactions are important for predicting the outcome -- and therefore are important for addressing confounding.

A crucial initial step in this process involves merging multiple data sources based on matching individual records, often in the absence of unique identifiers. When the datasets are networks, this problem is typically addressed through graph matching methodologies. For such cases, auxiliary features or covariates associated with nodes or edges can be instrumental in achieving improved accuracy. However, most existing graph matching techniques do not incorporate this information, limiting their performance against non-identifiable and erroneous matches. To overcome these limitations, we propose two novel covariate-assisted seeded graph matching methods, where a partial alignment for a set of nodes, called seeds, is known. The first one solves a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) over the whole graph, while the second one only leverages the local neighborhood structure of seed nodes for computational scalability. Both methods are grounded in a conditional modeling framework, where elements of one graph's adjacency matrix are modeled using a generalized linear model (GLM), given the other graph and the available covariates. We establish theoretical guarantees for model estimation error and exact recovery of the solution of the QAP. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated through numerical experiments and in an application to matching the statistics academic genealogy and the collaboration networks. By leveraging additional covariates, we achieve improved alignment accuracy. Our work highlights the power of integrating covariate information in the classical graph matching setup, offering a practical and improved framework for combining network data with wide-ranging applications."}

The problem formulation incorporates a mathematical model of the ferry's dynamics and environmental disturbances, specifically water currents and wind, which can significantly influence the dynamics. Real-world data and illustrative scenarios demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to effectively support ferry crews by providing real-time guidance.

We provide a no-go result showing that the cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient in the number of rounds and secure. We show this trade-off for stand-alone and composable security, where the scaling of the lower bound for the security parameters renders cut-and-choose quantum state verification effectively unusable."}

However, many studies have shown that spectral clustering does not perform well on certain network structures, particularly core-periphery networks. To improve clustering performance in core-periphery structures, Adjacency Spectral Embedding (ASE) has been introduced, which performs clustering via a network's adjacency matrix instead of the graph Laplacian. Despite its advantages in this setting, the optimal performance of ASE is limited to dense networks, whilst network data observed in practice is often sparse in nature. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach which we term Doubled Adjacency Spectral Embedding (DASE), motivated by the observation that the squared adjacency matrix will leverage the fewer connections in sparse structures more efficiently in clustering applications. Theoretical results establish that DASE enjoys good consistency properties when determining sparse community structure. The performance and general applicability of the proposed method is evaluated using extensive simulations on both directed and undirected networks. Our results highlight the improved clustering performance on both sparse and dense networks in the presence of core-periphery structures. We illustrate our proposed technique on real-world employment and transportation datasets."}

When only of these noises are considered, the LQC strategy leads to stochastic or robust controllers, respectively. However, there is no LQC strategy that can simultaneously handle stochastic and bounded noises efficiently. This limits the scope where existing LQC strategies can be applied. In this work, we look into the LQC problem for discrete-time systems that have both stochastic and bounded noises in its dynamics. We develop a state estimation for such systems by efficiently combining a Kalman filter and an ellipsoid set-membership filter. The developed state estimation can recover the estimation optimality when the system is subject to both kinds of noise, the stochastic and the bounded. Upon the estimated state, we derive a robust state-feedback optimal control law for the LQC problem. The control law derivation takes into account both stochastic and bounded-state estimation errors, so as to avoid over-conservativeness while sustaining stability in the control. In this way, the developed LQC strategy extends the range of scenarios where LQC can be applied, especially those of real-world control systems with diverse sensing which are subject to different kinds of noise. We present numerical simulations, and the results demonstrate the enhanced control performance with the proposed strategy."}

To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium."}

Specifically, the internal energy coherence needed for precise timekeeping affects the center of mass dynamics, enhancing position spreading during free evolution. As a result, a single composite system cannot act as a perfect quantum reference frame for both space and time, leading to a Heisenberg like uncertainty relation between spatial and temporal intervals. After analyzing this trade off from an external perspective, we formulate it in a purely relational manner, by means of covariant observables relative to the space time quantum reference frame, uncovering an additional intrinsic uncertainty of order the Compton wavelength of the frame."}

In this paper, we explore these local encodings from the perspective of the corresponding time-evolution unitaries. Specifically, we propose a new framework for digital implementations of these qubit-encoded fermionic time-evolution unitaries based on \\emph{flow sets}, which are one-dimensional subsets of the directed fermionic interaction graph. We find that any local fermionic encoding, when restricted to a given flow set, adopts a simple structure that we can classify systematically.

As an application of our construction, we introduce novel flow-based decompositions for known two-dimensional encodings, leading to efficient circuit decompositions of time-evolution unitaries.

However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($Δt$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $Δt$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $ε\\to 0$ of the error parameter $ε$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $ε\\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($ε^2$) vs O($Δt$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $ε$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $ε$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage."}

Under such double coupling, it is found that while the Hamiltonian of the system is clearly Hermitian the dynamics of the quadrature components of the field operators can be attributed to non-Hermicity of the system. It is manifested in an asymmetric coupling between the quadrature components which then leads to a variety of remarkable features. In particular, we identify how the emerging exceptional point controls the conversion of thermal states of the modes into single-mode classically or quantum squeezed states. Furthermore, for reservoirs being in squeezed states, we find that the two-photon correlations present in these reservoirs are responsible for unidirectional flow of populations and correlations among the modes and the flow can be controlled by appropriate tuning of the mutual orientation of the squeezed noise ellipses. In the course of analyzing these effects we find that the flow of the population creates the first-order coherence between the modes which, on the other hand rules out an enhancement of the two photon correlations responsible for entanglement between the modes. These results suggest new alternatives for the creation of single mode squeezed fields and the potential applications for controlled unidirectional transfer of population and correlations in bosonic chains."}

Here, we show that even under perfect isolation, intrinsic unitary dynamics with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis suppress the observable signatures of macroscopic coherence. Using the GHZ state as a representative example, we demonstrate that while fully correlated measurements can initially distinguish a macroscopic superposition from its corresponding classical mixture, generic many-body evolution renders them operationally indistinguishable for most times during the evolution. By analyzing both distinguishability measures and established quantifiers of macroscopic quantumness, we find that equilibration not only hides coherence from accessible observables but also suppresses macroscopic superpositions themselves. These results identify unitary thermalization, independent of environmental decoherence, as a fundamental mechanism that limits the emergence of macroscopic quantum effects."}

A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems."}

Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself.

Using an autoencoder neural network architecture on data from $L$-site Fermi-Hubbard models, we identify minimal latent spaces with a sharp reconstruction quality threshold at $L-1$ latent dimensions, matching the system's intrinsic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the use of the trained decoder as a differentiable variational ansatz to minimize energy directly within the latent space. Crucially, this approach circumvents the $N$-representability problem, as the learned manifold implicitly restricts the optimization to physically valid quantum states."}

It was derived in different ways over the past 100 years by Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Feynman. At the same time, other interpretations have been suggested, including the Bohm-De Broglie interpretation and the so-called Bohmian mechanics. Here, we show that Bohmian mechanics, which utilizes the concept of the Bohm quantum potential, can also serve as a starting point for quantizing classical non-relativistic systems. By incorporating the Bohm quantum potential into the Vlasov framework, we obtain a mean-field theory that captures the corpuscular nature of matter, in agreement with quantum mechanics within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA)."}

However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($Δt$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $Δt$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $ε\\to 0$ of the error parameter $ε$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $ε\\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($ε^2$) vs O($Δt$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $ε$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $ε$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage."}

Background-gas collisions impose limitations on trapped-ion performance and scalability by interrupting algorithmic execution and, in some cases, ejecting ions from the trap. Using molecular-flow simulations, we optimize the chamber geometry, conductance pathways, and pumping configuration to maximize the effective pumping speed at the ion location. We perform high-temperature heat treatment of stainless steel vacuum components to achieve the desired outgassing rate, guided by quantitative relations of bulk diffusive processes, allowing us to reduce the \\(\\mathrm{H_2}\\) outgassing load to the \\(10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{mbar\\,l\\,s^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}}\\) level. The final pressure in our chamber, measured by a hot cathode gauge, is \\(1.5\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{mbar}\\), corresponding to the gauge's measurement limit. We measure the local pressure at the ion location by observing collision-induced reordering events in a long ion chain of mixed-isotope Yb\\(^+\\). From the observed reordering frequency, we extract the average interval between collisions to be \\((1.9 \\pm 0.1)\\,\\mathrm{hrs/ion}\\). This corresponds to a local pressure of \\((3.9 \\pm 0.3)\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{mbar}\\) at the ion location, assuming that all collisions arise from background H\\(_2\\) molecules at room temperature. Our demonstration extends the continuous operation time of a quantum processor while maintaining the simplicity of a room-temperature system that does not require cryogenic apparatus."}

The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension."}

We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order. Our findings indicate that scar subspaces can inherit -- and in inhomogeneous cases systematically modify -- the topological character of the SPT ground state, offering a new and experimentally accessible platform for probing symmetry-protected topology beyond the ground-state regime."}
