To address this limitation, we\npropose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an\nexplainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between\nindividual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies\nsalient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding\nthrough a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their\nrepresentations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast\nnext-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model\ngenerates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of\neach keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to\n2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural\nnetworks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving\ncumulative returns by 18.5%.

However, the underlying propagation\ndynamics constantly shift with new topics or events, which are modeled as\nchanging coefficients of the underlying dynamics. Deep learning models struggle\nto adapt to these out-of-distribution shifts without extensive new data and\nretraining. To address this, we present Zero-Shot Forecasting of Network\nDynamics through Weight Flow Matching (FNFM), a generative,\ncoefficient-conditioned framework that generates dynamic model weights for an\nunseen target coefficient, enabling zero-shot forecasting. Our framework\nutilizes a Variational Encoder to summarize the forecaster weights trained in\nobserved environments into compact latent tokens. A Conditional Flow Matching\n(CFM) module then learns a continuous transport from a simple Gaussian\ndistribution to the empirical distribution of these weights, conditioned on the\ndynamical coefficients. This process is instantaneous at test time and requires\nno gradient-based optimization.

In this work, we investigate the range of projection\npair operators $\\mathcal{P}$ in the plane, i.e., operators formed by two\nprojections ($N=2$) applied to functions in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We find that the\nset of annihilators to $\\mathrm{rg}(\\mathcal{P})$ that are regular\ndistributions contains at most one dimension and a range condition can be\nexplicitly determined by what we refer to as `kernel conditions'. With this\ntool, we examine the exponential fanbeam transform for which no range\nconditions were known, finding that no (regular) range condition exists, and\ntherefore, arbitrary data can be approximated in an $L^2$ sense by projections\nof smooth functions. We also illustrate the use of this theory on a mixed\nparallel-fanbeam projection pair operator."}

The dynamics of magnetic particles in high-gradient magnetic\nfields-encompassing both their transport and eventual capture-arise from the\ncoupled interplay of field-driven drift, fluid advection, and particle-field\nfeedback. These processes remain poorly captured by existing models relying on\nempirical closures or discrete particle tracking. Here, we present a\nthermodynamically consistent continuum theory for collective magnetic particle\ntransport and capture in high-gradient fields. The framework derives from a\nfree-energy functional that couples magnetic energy, entropic mixing, and\nsteric interactions, yielding a concentration-dependent susceptibility via\nhomogenization theory.

In its original formulation,\nwith balanced positive and negative couplings, the model exhibits two phases: a\nquiescent regime, where all activity ceases, and a regime of ongoing irregular\ncollective activity, termed asynchronous chaos (AC), in which state variables\nfluctuate strongly in time and across units but average to zero across the\nnetwork. Building on recent work, we analyze an extension of the SCS model that\nbreaks this coupling balance, yielding a richer phase diagram. In addition to\nthe classical quiescent and AC phases, two additional regimes emerge, marked by\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. In the persistent-activity (PA) phase, each unit\nsettles into a distinct, stable activation state. In the synchronous-chaotic\n(SC) phase, dynamics remain irregular and chaotic but fluctuate around a\nnonzero mean, generating sustained long-time autocorrelations. Using analytical\ntechniques based on dynamical mean-field theory, complemented by extensive\nnumerical simulations, we show how structural disorder gives rise to symmetry\nand ergodicity breaking. Remarkably, the resulting phase diagram closely\nparallels that of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model, with the onset\nof the SC phase coinciding with the transition associated with replica-symmetry\nbreaking.

An\nalternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which\nare positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both\nadaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal\npopulations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable\ndifferences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a\nspatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial\ncoupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two\nadaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and\ninclude the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength\nand gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent\nunder a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength,\nleading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation\nstructure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves.\nAdditionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal\nactivity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of\nthe traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength.

By formulating the task of finding CE of a (quasi-)linear Fisher\nmarket as a strongly convex nonsmooth minimization problem, we develop a novel\naccelerated price-adjustment method (APM) that finds an $\\epsilon$-CE price in\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ lightweight iterations, which\nsignificantly improves upon the iteration complexities of t\\^atonnement\nmethods. Furthermore, through our new formulation, we construct a recovery\noracle that maps approximate CE prices to exact CE prices at a low\ncomputational cost. By coupling this recovery oracle with APM, we obtain an\nadaptive price-adjustment method whose iterates converge to CE prices in finite\nsteps.

The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian\nparticles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting\nJosephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear\ndissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear\ndissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the\ncharacterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in\nfour representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and\nthe formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous\nmathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear\ndissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the\nformer, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the\nOtt-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter\ncase, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an\neffective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional\nmechanism is impossible.

We complement these results by studying the\ncomputational optimality of this spectral algorithm. Namely, we show that, for\na much broader range of signal distributions, whenever the spectral algorithm\ncannot detect a low-rank signal, then neither can any low-degree polynomial\nalgorithm.

One\nstrategy to improve the accuracy of deep learning-based solutions for\ntime-dependent PDEs is to use the learned solution as the coarse propagator in\nthe Parareal method and a traditional numerical method as the fine solver.\nHowever, successful integration of deep learning into the Parareal method\nrequires consistency between the coarse and fine solvers, particularly for PDEs\nexhibiting rapid changes such as sharp transitions. To ensure such consistency,\nwe propose to use the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the fully\ndiscrete time-stepping operator defined by the traditional numerical scheme\nused as the fine solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod in solving the classical and mass-conservative Allen-Cahn (AC)\nequations. Through iterative updates in the Parareal algorithm, our approach\nachieves a significant computational speedup compared to traditional fine\nsolvers while converging to high-accuracy solutions. Our results highlight that\nthe proposed Parareal algorithm effectively accelerates simulations,\nparticularly when implemented on multiple GPUs, and converges to the desired\naccuracy in only a few iterations. Another advantage of our method is that the\nCNNs model is trained on trajectories-based on random initial conditions, such\nthat the trained model can be used to solve the AC equations with various\ninitial conditions without re-training.

Such problems arise\nin many structural engineering applications, but computational solution of\nBayesian inverse problems is often expensive because standard solution\napproaches require many evaluations of the forward model mapping the parameter\nvalue to predicted observations. In many settings, this forward model is\nexpensive because it requires the solution of a high-dimensional discretization\nof a partial differential equation.

In particular, we show: 1) 3-local LH cannot be solved in time\n$O(2^{\\frac{n}{2}(1-\\varepsilon)})$ for any $\\varepsilon > 0$ under QSETH; 2)\n3-local QPF cannot be approximated up to any constant relative error in\n$O(2^{\\frac{n}{2}(1-\\varepsilon)})$ time for any $\\varepsilon > 0$ under QSETH;\nand 3) we present a quantum algorithm that approximates QPF up to relative\nerror $1/2 + 1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ in $O^\\ast(2^{n/2})$ time, matching our\nconditional lower bound.\n  Notably, our results provide the first fine-grained lower bounds for both LH\nand QPF with fixed locality. This stands in sharp contrast to QSETH and the\ntrivial fine-grained lower bounds for LH, where the locality of the SAT\ninstance and the Hamiltonian depends on the parameter $\\varepsilon$ in the\n$O(2^{\\frac{n}{2}(1-\\varepsilon)})$ running time."}

Specifically, we prove that the\nstandard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking\nobstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a\nLipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof\nrelies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase\ntransition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to\ndecompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance.\nThis yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian\nevolution and shallow variational circuits.

On such hardware, it is useful to\nensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in\nthe noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for\nbiased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms.\nIn this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj\nQuantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving\ngates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel\ncharacterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a\nlinear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving\ngate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set\n{X,R_z(\\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \\theta is any irrational multiple of 2\\pi.\n(3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any\nZ-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving\ngates on the physical qubits.

This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem\nrelate to algebraic properties.

Such theories have made great developments in the 50\nyears since 1948. It has played a vital role in enabling the development of\nmodern ultra-fast, stable, and highly dependable information and communication\nsystems. The Shannon theory is supported by the statistical communication\ntheory such as detection and estimation theory. The theory of communication\nsystems that transmit Shannon information using quantum media is called quantum\nShannon information theory, and research began in the 1960s. The theoretical\nformulation comparable to conventional Shannon theory has been completed. Its\nimportant role is to suggest that application of quantum effect will surpass\nexisting communication performance. It would be meaningless if performance,\nefficiency, and utility were to deteriorate due to quantum effects, even if\ncertain new function is given. This paper suggests that there are various\nlimitations to utilizing quantum Shannon information theory to benefit\nreal-world communication systems and presents a theoretical framework for\nachieving the ultimate goal.

By toggling between broken\nand unbroken dark mode, this approach effectively manages the response\nbandwidth and exhibits intriguing additional noise characteristics.\nSpecifically, when the dark mode remains unbroken, the thermal noise is robust\nand reduced to half of that of a standard device. In contrast, when the dark\nmode is broken, thermal noise increases substantially at mechanical resonance\nbut remains the same as when the dark mode is unbroken at effective detection\nfrequencies. Moreover, our scheme offers the dual benefit of amplifying the\nmechanical response while suppressing additional noise, with the potential to\nsurpass the standard quantum limit."}

Recent works have shown that the training of IQP-QCBM is\nclassically tractable w.r.t. the so-called Gaussian kernel maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) loss function, while maintaining the potential of a quantum\nadvantage for sampling itself. Nonetheless, the model has a number of aspects\nwhere improvements would be important for more general utility: (1) the basic\nmodel is known to be not universal - i.e. it is not capable of representing\narbitrary distributions, and it was not known whether it is possible to achieve\nuniversality by adding hidden (ancillary) qubits; (2) a fixed Gaussian kernel\nused in the MMD loss can cause training issues, e.g., vanishing gradients. In\nthis paper, we resolve the first question and make decisive strides on the\nsecond. We prove that for an $n$-qubit IQP generator, adding $n + 1$ hidden\nqubits makes the model universal. For the latter, we propose a kernel-adaptive\ntraining method, where the kernel is adversarially trained.

We show that a\nconstant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of\narchitectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer\nmultiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity\ngraphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay\n(consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit\nensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond\nnorm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is\ntruly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative\nentropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest."}

In this work, we model metastable states as\napproximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master\nequation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal\nstructural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual\ninformation and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the\nlarger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the\nhallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not\nexclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural\nresults lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between\nlocal minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and\napproximate detailed balance conditions.
