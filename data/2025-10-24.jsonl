Among these,\nempiricists utilize the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator, which relies\non the parallel trends assumption. To improve its plausibility, researchers\noften match treated and control units before applying DiD, with the intuition\nthat matched groups are more likely to evolve similarly absent treatment.\nExisting work that analyze this practice, however, has focused solely on bias.\nWe complement and fill an important gap by analyzing the full bias-variance\ntradeoff. Under a linear structural model with unobserved time-varying\nconfounders, we show that variance results contrast with established bias\ninsights: matching on observed covariates prior to DiD is not always\nrecommended over the classic (unmatched) DiD due to a sample size tradeoff;\nfurthermore, matching additionally on pre-treatment outcomes is always\nbeneficial as such tradeoff no longer exists once matching is performed. We\ntherefore advocate mean squared error (MSE) as a final metric and give\npractitioner-friendly guidelines with theoretical guarantees on when (and on\nwhat variables) they should match on. We apply these insights to a recent study\non how the introduction of monetary incentives by a knowledge-sharing platform\naffects its general engagement and show that the authors' matching choice prior\nto DiD was both warranted and critical. In particular, we provide new\nmanagerial insights that after a full bias correction, their estimated effect\nwith matching still remains statistically significant, demonstrating that the\nchosen matching-DiD approach is sufficiently robust to address managerial\nconcerns over violations of parallel trends."}

To overcome this bottleneck, we develop a generalized\nBehler-Parrinello neural-network architecture -- originally formulated for ab\ninitio molecular dynamics -- to accurately and efficiently predict forces from\nlocal structural environments. Using the locality of electronic responses, the\nresulting ML force field achieves linear scaling efficiency while maintaining\nquantitative accuracy.

Recent bulk\nmeasurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic\nfrustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states,\npotentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed\nmicroscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed\nthe transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$\\mu$SR) technique,\napplying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline\nCePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $\\mu$SR data indicate\nthat field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$\nexhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B>$B_{c2}$ they yield\ncontrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate\n($\\lambda_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with\nan indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature\nindependent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical\nspin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.

This paper addresses tactical\nplanning of intermodal railroad operations by introducing a new problem that\nsimultaneously considers three consolidation processes and the management of a\nheterogeneous railcar fleet. We model the problem with a scheduled service\nnetwork design with resource management (SSND-RM) formulation, expressed as an\ninteger linear program. While such formulations are challenging to solve at\nscale, we demonstrate that our problem can be tackled with a general-purpose\nsolver when provided with high-quality warm-start solutions. To this end, we\ndesign a construction heuristic inspired by a relax-and-fix procedure. We\nevaluate the methodology on realistic, large-scale instances from our\nindustrial partner, the Canadian National Railway Company: a North American\nClass I railroad. The computational experiments show that the proposed approach\nefficiently solves practically relevant instances, and that solutions to the\nSSND-RM formulation yield substantially more accurate capacity estimations\ncompared to those obtained from simpler baseline models. Managerial insights\nfrom our study highlight that ignoring railcar fleet management or container\nloading constraints can lead to a severe underestimation of required capacity,\nwhich may result in costly operational inefficiencies. Furthermore, our results\nshow that the use of multi-platform railcars improves overall capacity\nutilization and benefits the network, even if they can locally lead to less\nefficient loading as measured by terminal-level slot utilization performance\nindicators."}

The proposed\nmethod trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from\noffline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving\noptimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the\nlearning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate\ndistribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in\nrenewable generation and demand.
