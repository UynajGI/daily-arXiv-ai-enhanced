Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical analysis: We establish discrete convergence rates of $O(\\sqrt{Δt} \\log(1/Δt))$ via Donsker's principle and linear algorithmic convergence of $(1-κ)^{2/3}$; (2) Algorithmic improvements: We introduce incremental updates ($O(M^2)$ complexity) and adaptive sparse grids; (3) Numerical implementation: A hybrid neural-projection solver is proposed, combining transformer-based warm-starting with Newton-Raphson projection. Once trained, the pure neural solver achieves a $1{,}597\\times$ online inference speedup ($4.7$s $\\to 2.9$ms) suitable for real-time applications, while the hybrid solver ensures martingale constraints to $10^{-6}$ precision.

This paper proposes a dynamic, state-dependent framework for order flow signal extraction that adapts to shifting market conditions in the Korean stock market. Using daily transaction data from 2020--2024 covering 2,439 stocks and 2.79 million stock-day observations, we implement three complementary methodologies: (1) an Adaptive Kalman Filter where measurement noise variance is explicitly coupled to market volatility; (2) a three-state Markov-Switching model identifying Bull, Normal, and Crisis regimes; and (3) an Asymmetric Response Function capturing differential investor reactions to positive versus negative shocks. We find that foreign investor predictive power increases 8.9-fold during crisis periods relative to bull markets ($β_{crisis}=0.00204$ vs. $β_{bull}=0.00023$), while individual investors exhibit momentum-chasing behavior with 6.3 times stronger response to positive shocks. The integrated ``All-Weather'' strategy provides modest drawdown reduction during extreme market events, though challenges remain in the post-COVID high-rate environment."}

Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge.

A general velocity and entropy density system is analyzed with the unified thermodynamic algorithm of metriplectic dynamics, and we show that the positive spectra of the KS equation due to an external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. A variant of the KS equation is produced that monotonically generates an entropy, but the only equilibria of this variant system are spatially constant.

The entropy of this thermodynamic system is increased further by the driving effects of the KS equation, reconciling the generation of entropy with the energy source of the KS equation. Further numerical experiments restrict the positive spectra in the KS equation to determine the effect on the system time evolution. While rescaling the growth rates of instabilities reproduces similar behavior on a slower time scale, introduction of individual positive spectra reproduces the formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and a transition to chaos."}

Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated.\n  Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors.

A typical model assumes that the conditional distribution of the response follows a von-Mises distribution. However, this assumption is inadequate when the response variable is multimodal. For this reason, in this paper, a finite mixture of regressions model is proposed for the case of a circular response variable and a set of circular and/or linear covariates. Mixture models are very useful when the underlying population is multimodal. Despite the prevalence of multimodality in regression modelling of circular data, the use of mixtures of regressions has received no attention in the literature. This paper aims to close this knowledge gap. To estimate the proposed model, we develop a maximum likelihood estimation procedure via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. An extensive simulation study is used to demonstrate the practical use and performance of the proposed model and estimation procedure. In addition, the model is shown to be useful as a model-based clustering tool. Lastly, the model is applied to a real dataset from a wind farm in South Africa."}

However, due to cost and logistical constraints, it is often difficult to deploy dense seismic networks suitable for high-resolution tomography. While reliable interpolation of EGFs at unsampled locations could enhance tomographic resolution, the task remains inherently challenging and underexplored due to the dispersive nature of EGFs. In this study, we introduce DIER (diffusion-assisted implicit EGF representation), a self-supervised learning framework that integrates implicit neural representation with denoising diffusion probabilistic models to achieve high-fidelity EGF interpolation. In DIER, the diffusion process is conditioned on station coordinates to guide the transformation from random noise into EGF waveforms, which allows flexible reconstruction of five-dimensional EGF fields without labeled data or synthetic waveforms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DIER through continent-scale EGF interpolation across the United States. The results show that DIER significantly outperforms the conventional radial basis function-based interpolation approach by generating EGFs with markedly improved phase alignment and dispersion characteristics. Surface wave tomography using the phase velocities derived from the interpolated EGFs also closely matches a reference model constructed from data acquired by a much denser seismic network. Our findings suggest that DIER provides a promising and cost-effective approach toward high-resolution ambient noise tomography in regions with sparse station coverage."}

This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors.

When embedded within extended matter distributions such as prolate, shell-like halos, they give rise to complex gravitational fields that often drive nearby particles into chaotic orbits. The inherently nonlinear nature of such motion, shaped by general relativity, makes direct analysis highly challenging. To overcome this, pseudo-Newtonian potentials are used to approximate relativistic effects within a Newtonian framework. In this study, we model the central SMBH using the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov (1996) potential to mimic the rotational effects of a Kerr-like black hole. The surrounding prolate halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution, represented through a multipole expansion including dipole and quadrupole components. Poincare sections and the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE) reveal how the SMBH-halo system drives both order and chaos, with the SMBH spin modulating the dynamics by enhancing or suppressing chaos depending on its direction and magnitude."}

Existing dense crowd models, mostly two-dimensional and contact-based, overlook biomechanical mechanisms that govern individual balance motion. In this study, we introduce a minimal two-level pedestrian model that couples upper body and legs dynamics, allowing us to capture transitions between balanced and unbalanced states at the individual scale. Whereas previous models fail to achieve it, this coupling gives rise to emergent collective behaviours observed empirically, such as self-organized waves and large-scale rotational motion within the crowd. The model bridges basic individual biomechanical concepts and macroscopic flow dynamics, offering a new framework for modelling and understanding collective motions in ultra-dense crowds."}

However, observational evidence of such interaction is scarce and precise energy transfer is unknown. In this paper, an extensive spectral study is reported using mooring data from nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors in about half-a-cubic hectometer of seawater above a deep flat Northwestern-Mediterranean seafloor. The number of independent data records partially improves statistics for better determination of spectral slopes, which however do not show a roll-off to the viscous dissipation range of turbulence. The spectra hardly show power-laws omega^p having exponent p = -5/3 representing an inertial subrange that evidences shear-induced isotropic turbulence. Instead, they are dominated by p = -7/5 representing a buoyancy subrange, which evidences convection-induced anisotropic turbulence. In contrast with p=-5/3 that indicates a downgradient cascade of energy, p=-7/5 characterizes by an ambiguous cascade direction. At height h<50 m above seafloor, p=-7/5 is found adjacent to instrumental noise. The p=-7/5 is also found in the sub-mesoscale/internal wave band that is elevated in variance by one order of magnitude. It is reasoned that this sub-inertial range cannot represent isotropic motions, hence p .ne. -5/3 at all heights, and a new deep-sea energy cascade is proposed between mesoscales and turbulence dissipation. Only higher up in more stratified waters an inertial subrange is formed. The transition from internal waves into large-scale turbulence follows p = -2, while a higher-frequency transition from 0 to pi phase change reflects overturns of slanted convection or standing-wave breaking leading to isotropic turbulence."}

In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet."}

Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step.\n  When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and connectivity constraints. By applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the daily evolution operator, we identify a unique periodic invariant population distribution that serves as a natural non-transient reference state. We verify consistency between trajectory-level realizations and multi-step Markov dynamics, showing that discrepancies are entirely attributable to finite-population sampling. The framework provides a network-centric, privacy-preserving approach to generating mobility trajectories and studying time-elapsed flow structure without invoking individual-level behavioral assumptions."}

This problem can be formulated as the minimization of the trace of the solution of a Lyapunov equation whose coefficient matrix depends on $ν$. For physical relevance, the damping coefficients must be nonnegative and the resulting system must be asymptotically stable. We identify conditions under which the system is never stable or may lose stability for certain choices of $ν$. In the latter case, we propose replacing the constraint $ν\\ge 0$ with $ν\\ge d$, where $d$ is a nonzero nonnegative vector chosen to ensure stability.\n  We derive explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the objective function and show that the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions are equivalent to the vanishing of a nonlinear residual function at an optimal solution. To compute such a solution, we propose a Barzilai--Borwein residual minimization algorithm (BBRMA), which is simple and efficient but not globally convergent, and a spectral projected gradient (SPG) method, which is globally convergent. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we show how to efficiently compute the objective function and its gradient, with eigenvalue decompositions constituting the dominant cost in terms of execution time. Numerical experiments show that both methods require fewer eigenvalue decompositions than the fast optimal damping algorithm (FODA), and that, although SPG may incur additional decompositions due to line search, it often converges faster than BBRMA, leading to a lower overall computational effort."}

These \"latent positions\" are often estimated via embeddings, whereby the nodes of a network are mapped to points in Euclidean space so that \"similar\" nodes are mapped to nearby points. Under certain model assumptions, these embeddings are consistent estimates of the latent positions, but most such results require that the embedding dimension be chosen correctly, typically equal to the dimension of the latent space. Methods for estimating this correct embedding dimension have been studied extensive in recent years, but there has been little work to date characterizing the behavior of embeddings when this embedding dimension is misspecified. In this work, we provide theoretical descriptions of the effects of misspecifying the embedding dimension of the adjacency spectral embedding under the random dot product graph, a class of latent space network models that includes a number of widely-used network models as special cases, including the stochastic blockmodel. We consider both the case in which the dimension is chosen too small, where we prove estimation error lower-bounds, and the case where the dimension is chosen too large, where we show that consistency still holds, albeit at a slower rate than when the embedding dimension is chosen correctly.A range of synthetic data experiments support our theoretical results. Our main technical result, which may be of independent interest, is a generalization of earlier work in random matrix theory, showing that all non-signal eigenvectors of a low-rank matrix subject to additive noise are delocalized."}

However, practical routes to deterministically and reversibly control IP-AHE remain limited. Here, we establish a symmetry-engineered IP-AHE platform, CaRuO3/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3/CaRuO3 heterostructure on NdGaO3(110), that turns strict mirror-symmetry breaking constraints into effective tuning knobs. IP-AHE in these epitaxial trilayers unambiguously couples to the CaRuO3-buffer-induced mirror-symmetry breaking and faithfully reproduces the ferromagnetic hysteresis.

These large values of the power index are attributed to the size-dependence of collective chaos in the finite ensemble, which disappears in the thermodynamic limit. We also show that in the standard Kuramoto model for a symmetric set of frequencies, there is an additional transition to a symmetric chaotic state with vanishing diffusion of the global phase."}

Yet their practical usefulness and performance depend critically on reliability, quantified by the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs), i.e., normalized fluctuations of work and power, where reliability decreases inversely with increasing NSR. We establish fundamental limits to this reliability: both work and power NSRs are universally bounded from below by a function of charging speed, imposing a reliability limit inherent to any quantum battery. More strikingly, we find that a quantum mechanical uncertainty relation forbids the simultaneous suppression of work and power fluctuations, revealing a fundamental trade-off that also limits the reliability of quantum batteries. We analyze the trade-off and limits, as well as their scaling behavior, across parallel (local), collective {(fully non-local)}, and hybrid (semi-local) charging schemes for many-body quantum batteries, finding that increasing power by exploiting stronger entanglement comes at the cost of diminished reliability of power. Similar trends are also observed in the charging of quantum batteries utilizing transverse Ising-like interactions. These suggest that achieving both high power and reliability require neither parallel nor collective charging, but a hybrid charging scheme with an intermediate range of interactions. Therefore, our analysis shapes the practical and efficient design of reliable and high-performance quantum batteries."}

Simulation-based optimization is widely used to address this, yet traditional methods often overlook the uncertainty in model parameters. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework to minimize warpage and quantify the uncertainty of optimal process settings. We employ polynomial regression models as surrogates for the injection molding simulations of a box-shaped part. By adopting a Bayesian framework, we estimate the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients. This approach allows us to generate a distribution of optimal decisions rather than a single point estimate, providing a measure of solution robustness. Furthermore, we develop a Monte Carlo-based boundary analysis method. This method constructs confidence bands for the zero-level sets of the response surfaces, helping to visualize the regions where warpage transitions between convex and concave profiles. We apply this framework to optimize four key process parameters: mold temperature, injection speed, packing pressure, and packing time. The results show that our approach finds stable process settings and clearly marks the boundaries of defects in the parameter space."}

In addition, a theme that cuts across all environmental compartments and disciplines, and is implemented on all Tara Polaris expeditions, is the establishment of an observatory that will monitor the main sentinels of this ecosystem.

The effects of such adaptive mechanisms have been studied for processes in which pairwise interactions drive contagion. However, contagion and the perception of infection risk can also involve (\"higher-order\") group interactions, leading potentially to new phenomenology. How adaptive behavior resulting from risk perception affects higher-order processes remains an open question. Here, we consider the impact of several risk-based adaptive behaviors on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes, using numerical simulations and an analytical mean-field approach. For pairwise contagion, adaptive mechanisms based on local (pairwise or group-based) risk perception impact only the endemic state, without affecting the epidemic phase transition. For higher-order contagion processes, instead, the adaptivity defuses the impact of non-linear group interactions: this reduces or even completely suppresses the parameter range in which bistability is possible, effectively transforming a higher-order contagion process into a pairwise one."}

The methodology combines dynamic asset eligibility, deterministic rebalancing, and bounded multi-factor tilts applied to an equal-weight baseline. Asset eligibility is formalized as a state-dependent constraint on portfolio construction, allowing factor exposure to adjust endogenously in response to observable market conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and cross-sectional breadth. Rather than estimating expected returns or covariances, the framework relies on cross-sectional rankings and hard structural bounds to control concentration, turnover, and fragility. The resulting approach is fully algorithmic, transparent, and directly implementable. It provides a robustness-oriented alternative to parametric optimization and unconstrained multi-factor models, particularly suited for long-horizon allocations where stability and operational feasibility are primary objectives."}

This manuscript has been submitted to Advances in Statistical Climatology, Meteorology and Oceanography (ASCMO)", "summary": "The increasing occurrence of extreme weather events since the beginning of the 21st century has led to the development of new methods to attribute extreme events to anthropogenic climate change. How the extreme event is defined has a major influence on the attribution result. A frequently disregarded or evaded aspect concerns the temporal dependence and the clustering of extremes. This study presents an approach for attributing complete time series during extreme events to anthropogenic forcing. The approach is based on a non-stationary Markov process using bivariate extreme value theory to model the temporal dependence of the time series. We calculate the likelihood ratio of an observational time series from ERA5 given the distributions as estimated from CMIP6 simulations with historical natural-only and natural and anthropogenic forcing scenarios. The spatial fields are condensed by the extremal pattern index as a compact description of spatial extremes. In addition, the study examines the extent to which attribution statements about the occurrence of extreme heat events change when the effect of the mean warming is eliminated. The resulting attribution statement provides very strong evidence for the scenario with anthropogenic drivers over Europe, especially since the beginning of the 21st century. For central and southern Europe, the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on heatwaves could already have been proven in the 1970s using today's methods. There is no reliable signal apart from a general increase in temperature, neither in terms of the temporal dependence of extreme heat days nor in terms of the shape of the extreme value distribution."}

Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\\text{mix}} = \\exp [Ω(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories."}

In real materials, this problem has been extensively studied in transition metal compounds, where various quantum phenomena arise from the spin and orbital degeneracy of the d electrons on individual transition-metal atoms. In contrast, materials containing high-symmetry clusters composed of multiple transition-metal atoms are expected to exhibit more emergent phenomena due to the entanglement of the electronic degrees of freedom across multiple atoms. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct mechanisms of orbital-degeneracy lifting in NbSeI, which comprises Nb4 tetrahedral clusters with molecular orbital degrees of freedom and whose average crystal structure is predicted to host a flat-band metal. Below 106 K, NbSeI is found to be a nonmagnetic molecular orbital-ordered insulator. Above this temperature, the average structure becomes face-centered cubic without any superlattice, while the orbital degeneracy remains lifted by significant local distortions of Nb4 tetrahedra, which may be associated with a molecular orbital-liquid or orbital-frozen state. This noncooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes a nonmagnetic insulating state above 106 K, in stark contrast to the flat-band metal predicted from the average structure."}

Standard algorithms typically fail in this regime, as heavy-tailed covariates distort the empirical risk geometry. We propose a unified framework, Robust Iterative Gradient descent with Hard Thresholding (RIGHT), which employs a robust gradient estimator to bypass the need for higher-order moment conditions. Our analysis reveals a fundamental decoupling phenomenon: in linear regression, the estimation error rate is governed by the noise tail index, while the sample complexity required for stability is governed by the design tail index. This implies that while heavy-tailed noise limits precision, heavy-tailed designs primarily raise the sample size barrier for convergence. In contrast, for logistic regression, we show that the bounded gradient naturally robustifies the estimator against heavy-tailed designs, restoring standard parametric rates. We derive matching minimax lower bounds to prove that RIGHT achieves optimal estimation accuracy and sample complexity across these regimes, without requiring sample splitting or the existence of the population risk."}

We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles."}

At a low temperature (T = 30 K) in the CO ordered phase, the Yb $4f$ valence remains nearly constant up to a pressure P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa, and then increases gradually at higher pressures. In contrast, at room temperature in the normal phase, an anomalous decrease of the Yb $4f$ valence is observed, without any accompanying structural phase transition. This behavior is corroborated by a systematic pressure dependent decrease of the unit-cell volume. Based on a Birch-Murnaghan analysis, the compressibility indicates hardening of the lattice with applied pressure up to a distinct kink seen at P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa. In contrast, for P $>$ P$_K$, the Yb $4f$ valency saturates and the compressibility reveals a counterintuitive pressure-induced softening.

However, previous protocols often assume noise affects only the signal accumulation step, while the QEC operations -- including state preparation and measurement -- are noiseless.

We focus on estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise, together with state preparation and measurement errors in all QEC operations. We propose a fault-tolerant metrological protocol where a repetition code is prepared via repeated syndrome measurements, followed by a fault-tolerant logical measurement. We demonstrate the existence of an error threshold, below which errors are effectively suppressed and the HL is attained."}

This letter presents a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework for dynamic model discovery (LLM-DMD) which integrates the reasoning and code synthesis capabilities of LLMs to discover dynamic equations and enforce algebraic constraints through two sequential loops: the differential-equation loop that identifies state dynamics and associated variables, and the algebraic-equation loop that formulates algebraic constraints on the identified algebraic variables. In each loop, executable skeletons of power system dynamic equations are generated by the LLM-based agent and evaluated via gradient-based optimizer. Candidate models are stored in an island-based archive to guide future iterations, and evaluation stagnation activates a variable extension mechanism that augments the model with missing algebraic or input variables, such as stator currents to refine the model. Validation on synchronous generator benchmarks of the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the superiority of LLM-DMD in complete dynamic model discovery."}

Our analysis of the classical phase-space structure and its excited-state quantum phase transitions leads us to three dynamical regimes: symmetry-breaking low-energy states, an intermediate region where quantum and classical equilibrium states markedly disagree, and a high-energy regime with restored correspondence. The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space. This mismatch originates from the population of imbalance-carrying eigenstates and persists even for relatively large number of particles. Our results reveal unexpectedly slow convergence to the classical limit, signaling robust finite-size effects in collective many-body dynamics."}

Inspired by regularized continuous reformulations of the maximum-clique problem, we derive a penalized continuous formulation leading to a nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problem. We further introduce the notion of stable global solutions, namely points remaining optimal under small perturbations of the penalty parameters, and prove an equivalence between stable global solutions of the continuous reformulation and largest cliques that are common to all the adversarially perturbed graphs. In order to solve the given nonsmooth problem, we develop a first-order and projection-free algorithm based on generalized subdifferential calculus in the sense of Clarke and Goldstein, and establish global sublinear convergence rates for it.

Due to the high-order derivatives (sixth-order) and the strongly nonlinear term (locally Lipschitz), developing high-order stable schemes and establishing corresponding error estimates is particularly challenging. In this study, we first establish a general framework for high-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge--Kutta methods that preserves the original energy dissipation for auxiliary models with globally Lipschitz truncations on the nonlinear term. By employing the Sobolev embedding theorem and Cauchy's interlace theorem, we demonstrate that the solutions of the auxiliary models are identical to the solutions of the original models without the globally Lipschitz property, provided that the free energy of the initial value is well-defined. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the uniform boundedness of the solution in the L-infinity norm and unconditional global-in-time stability. This allows for a straightforward framework to derive optimal arbitrarily high-order L-infinity error estimate without relying on the Lipschitz assumption. In particular, compared to existing literature, the argument for error estimation is presented in a much more simplified and elegant manner, without imposing any constraints on time-step size or mesh grid size. In fact, the reported framework, built upon the truncated auxiliary problem for the original model, can be directly extended to a wide range of gradient flows, including Allen--Cahn equations, nonlocal PFC models, and epitaxial thin film growth equations, providing unconditional energy dissipation without enforcing Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we present numerical examples to validate our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing long-time dynamics."}

However, distinguishing the roles of Kitaev interactions and the symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) remains challenging, since both mechanisms may lead to similar magnetic excitations and thermal transport properties. To tackle this challenge, using a ferromagnetic honeycomb insulator VI3 as a model system, we systematically study the angular-dependent thermal Hall conductivity Kxy(θ, Φ) with both out-of-plane (θ) and in-plane (Φ) magnetic field rotations. Our results reveal a persistent thermal Hall response for both out-of-plane and in-plane rotating magnetic fields, devoid of the sign-reversal patterns characteristic of Kitaev physics. Instead, quantitative analysis shows that the angular dependent Kxy(θ, Φ) is governed by the projection between the magnetic moment and a tilted DM vector containing both out-of-plane and in-plane components. These results not only establish the DMI-driven topological magnetic excitations as the origin of the thermal Hall response in VI3 but also highlight the angular-dependent thermal Hall effect measurements as an effective approach for distinguishing competing interactions in quantum magnets."}

We developed an algorithm using Adaptive LASSO to predict optimal interpretable linear ITR in the RWD. To encourage sparsity, we obtain an ITR by minimizing the risk function with various types of penalties and different methods of contrast estimation. Simulation studies were conducted to select the best configuration and to compare the novel algorithm with the existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm was applied to RWD to predict the optimal interpretable ITR. Simulations show that adaptive LASSO had the highest rates of correctly selected variables and augmented inverse probability weighting with Super Learner performed best for estimating treatment contrast.

We introduce fundamental concepts of shape sensitivity analysis and their numerical applications, mainly for educational purposes, while also emphasizing computational efficiency via parallelism for practitioners. We adopt an optimize-then-discretize strategy based on the distributed shape derivative and its tensor representation, following the approach of \\cite{MR3843884} and extending it in several directions. The numerical shape modeling relies on a level set method, whose evolution is driven by a descent direction computed from the shape derivative. Geometric constraints are treated accurately through a Proximal-Perturbed Lagrangian approach. FormOpt leverages the powerful features of FEniCSx, particularly its support for weak formulations of partial differential equations, diverse finite element types, and scalable parallelism. The implementation supports three different parallel computing modes: data parallelism, task parallelism, and a mixed mode. Data parallelism exploits FEniCSx's mesh partitioning features, and we implement a task parallelism mode which is useful for problems governed by a set of partial differential equations with varying parameters. The mixed mode conveniently combines both strategies to achieve efficient utilization of computational resources."}

As a prototype model, we consider the telegraph equation in one spatial dimension subject to periodic boundary conditions with an asymptotic limit given by the linear heat equation. We provide a general semidiscrete stability result for this model when spatially discretized by arbitrary periodic (upwind) SBP operators and formally prove that the fully discrete scheme is asymptotic preserving. Moreover, we prove that DoD with central numerical fluxes leads to periodic SBP operators. Furthermore, we show that adapting the upwind DoD scheme yields periodic upwind SBP operators. Consequently, the DoD stabilization possesses the desired properties considered in the first part of this work and thus leads to a stable and asymptotic preserving scheme for the telegraph equation. We back our theoretical results with numerical simulations and demonstrate the applicability of this cut-cell stabilization for implicit time integration in the heat equation limit."}

Here, we report that YbCr6Ge6 hosting both Cr-kagome lattice and Yb-4f electrons exhibits HF behaviors and a robust antiferromagnetic ground state with transition temperature TN = 3 K, significantly higher than other similar kagome metals with Yb ions. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the coexistence of FBs originating from both Cr-kagome lattice and localized Yb-4f electrons near Fermi energy level EF. More importantly, the clear spectroscopic signatures of a hybridization of Yb-4f FB with kagome-lattice-derived conduction bands and the high density of states of Cr-kagome FB near EF provide the underlying microscopic mechanisms of HF behaviors and enhanced antiferromagnetism in YbCr6Ge6. Our findings demonstrate that the novel kagome HF metals can not only host the cooperative coexistence of two different types of FBs, but also provide a paradigm material platform to explore the exotic correlated topological quantum phenomena."}

In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles."}

In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet."}

This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems. Our findings provide new insights into the realization of squeezed states in phonon-based systems, with potential applications in quantum metrology and information processing."}

We formulate SBOED as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and learn an amortized design policy via policy-gradient reinforcement learning (PGRL), enabling online design selection from the experiment history without repeatedly solving an SBOED optimization problem. To make policy training and reward evaluation scalable, we combine dual dimension reduction -- active subspace projection for the parameter and principal component analysis for the state -- with an adjusted derivative-informed latent attention neural operator (LANO) surrogate that predicts both the parameter-to-solution map and its Jacobian. We use a Laplace-based D-optimality reward while noting that, in general, other expected-information-gain utilities such as KL divergence can also be used within the same framework.

The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space.

To analyze the behavior of quantized control system, we introduce a new type of discrete homogeneity, where the dilation is defined by a discrete group. The converse Lyapunov function theorem is established for homogeneous systems with respect to discrete dilations. By extending the notion of sector-boundedness to a homogeneous vector space, we derive a generalized homogeneous sector-boundedness condition that guarantees finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear control system under quantized measurements. A geometry-aware homogeneous static vector quantizer is then designed using generalized homogeneous coordinates, enabling an efficient quantization scheme. The resulting homogeneous control system with the proposed quantizer is proven to be homogeneous with respect to discrete dilation and globally finite-time, nearly fixed-time, or exponentially stable, depending on the homogeneity degree.

Its core input model is the block encoding framework, in which non-unitary matrices are embedded into larger unitary matrices. Because the gate complexity of the block-encoding subroutine largely determines the overall cost of QSVT-based algorithms, developing new and more efficient block encodings is crucial for achieving practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for constructing quantum circuits that block encode linear combinations of Pauli strings. Our approach relies on two key components. First, we apply a transformation that converts the Pauli strings into pairwise anti-commuting ones, making the transformed linear combination unitary and thus directly implementable as a quantum circuit. Second, we employ a correction transformation based on the stabilizer formalism which uses an ancilla register to restore the original Pauli strings. Our method can be implemented with an ancilla register whose size scales logarithmically with the number of system qubits. It can also be extended to larger ancilla registers, which can substantially reduce the overall quantum circuit complexity. We present four concrete examples and use numerical simulations to compare our method's circuit complexity with that of the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) approach. We find that our method achieves circuit complexities comparable to or better than LCU, with possible advantages when the structure of the target operators can be exploited. These results suggest that our approach could enable more efficient block encodings for a range of relevant problems extending beyond the examples analyzed in this work."}

When the interaction vanishes, QIBD reduces to the classical Bhattacharyya distance; however, for entangling interactions, it cannot be expressed as a function of fidelity alone. Numerical simulations demonstrate that QIBD responds to correlation structure in ways that overlap-based measures do not, suggesting potential utility in contexts where interaction-aligned correlations are physically relevant."}

We experimentally demonstrate scalable, optimal photon distillation as a substantially more resource-efficient strategy to reduce indistinguishability errors in a way that is compatible with fault-tolerant operation. Photon distillation is an intrinsically bosonic, coherent error-mitigation technique which exploits quantum interference to project single photons into purified internal states, thereby reducing indistinguishability errors at both a higher efficiency and higher threshold than quantum error correction. We observe unconditional error reduction (i.e., below-threshold behaviour) consistent with theoretical predictions, even when accounting for noise introduced by the distillation gate, thereby achieving actual net-gain error mitigation under conditions relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

On the other hand, counterdiabatic algorithms have shown advantages in both performance and circuit depth when compared to standard adiabatic approaches. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that integrates the ADAPT-VQE framework with counterdiabatic driving within an adiabatic evolution scheme. Specifically, we map the molecular Hamiltonian to a qubit representation and construct an adiabatic Hamiltonian, from which an approximate adiabatic gauge potential is computed using nested commutators. The resulting operator terms define the operator pool, and the ADAPT-VQE algorithm is applied to iteratively select the most relevant elements for the ansatz. Our results demonstrate improvements in performance and reductions in circuit depth compared to using either counterdiabatic algorithms or ADAPT-VQE with fermionic excitation operators, thus supporting the effectiveness of combining both paradigms in molecular simulations."}

By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity."}

Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\\text{mix}} = \\exp [Ω(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories."}
