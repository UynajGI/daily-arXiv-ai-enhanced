The method advances\nhigh-resolution schemes by combining the efficiency of linear reconstruction\nwith the robustness of nonlinear formulations, activated only when needed\nthrough a novel a priori detection strategy. This minimizes the use of costly\nCompact Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (CWENOZ) or Monotonic\nUpstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) reconstructions,\nreducing computational cost without compromising accuracy or stability. The\nframework merges CWENOZ and the Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection\n(MOOD) paradigm while introducing a redesigned Numerical Admissibility Detector\n(NAD) that classifies the local flow into smooth, weakly non-smooth, and\ndiscontinuous regions in a single step. Each region is then reconstructed using\nan optimal method: a high-order linear scheme in smooth areas, CWENOZ in weakly\nnon-smooth zones, and a second-order MUSCL near discontinuities. This targeted\na priori allocation preserves high-order accuracy where possible and ensures\nstable, non-oscillatory behavior near shocks and steep gradients. Implemented\nwithin the open-source unstructured finite-volume solver UCNS3D, the framework\nsupports arbitrary-order reconstructions on mixed-element meshes. Extensive\ntwo- and three-dimensional benchmarks confirm that it retains the designed\naccuracy in smooth regions while greatly improving robustness in\nshock-dominated flows. Thanks to the reduced frequency of nonlinear\nreconstructions, the method achieves up to 2.5x speed-up over a CWENOZ scheme\nof equal order in 3D compressible turbulence. This hybrid approach thus brings\nhigh-order accuracy closer to industrial-scale CFD through its balance of\nefficiency, robustness, and reliability."}

It turns out that these results even extend to cases in\nwhich $X$ is not discrete. Finally, in a general setup, our approach gives rise\nto an approximation for $F_X$ as a certain Neumann sum. The properties of this\nsum are briefly examined theoretically and visually. The paper is concluded\nwith a short discussion of operator theoretical aspects and an outlook on\nfurther research. Various plots underline our results and illustrate the\ncapabilities of our functions with regard to estimation."}

The widespread approach to mutational signature\nanalysis consists of decomposing the matrix of mutation counts from a sample of\npatients via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms. However, by\nworking with aggregate counts, this procedure ignores the non-homogeneous\npatterns of occurrence of somatic mutations along the genome, as well as the\ntissue-specific characteristics that notoriously influence their rate of\nappearance. This gap is primarily due to a lack of adequate methodologies to\nleverage locus-specific covariates directly in the factorization.

Using covariate-dependent factorized intensity\nfunctions, our Poisson process factorization (PPF) generalizes the baseline NMF\nmodel to include regression coefficients that capture the effect of commonly\nknown genomic features on the mutation rates from each latent process.\nFurthermore, our method relies on sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors to\nautomatically infer the number of active latent factors in the data, avoiding\nthe need to fit multiple models for a range of plausible ranks.

The FIC-based\nvariable selection involves the minimization of the asymptotic risk in the\nestimation of a certain parametric focus function of interest under potential\nmodel misspecification. We systematically investigate the key asymptotics of\nthe maximum likelihood estimators under the sequence of locally perturbed\nmutually contiguous probability models.

Presently, a\nparticularly relevant case is that of high-energy density next-generation\nbatteries with metal anodes, that cannot yet reach practical cyclability\ntargets, owing to uncontrolled elelctrode shape evolution. In this scenario,\nmathematical modelling is a key tool to lay the knowledge-base for\nmaterials-science advancements liable to lead to concretely stable battery\nmaterial architectures. In this work, we introduce the Evolving Surface DIB\n(ESDIB) model, a reaction-diffusion system posed on a dynamically evolving\nelectrode surface. Unlike previous fixed-surface formulations, the ESDIB model\ncouples surface evolution to the local concentration of electrochemical\nspecies, allowing the geometry of the electrode itself to adapt in response to\ndeposition. To handle the challenges related to the coupling between surface\nmotion and species transport, we numerically solve the system by proposing an\nextension of the Lumped Evolving Surface Finite Element Method (LESFEM) for\nspatial discretisation, combined with an IMEX Euler scheme for time\nintegration. The model is validated through six numerical experiments, each\ncompared with laboratory images of electrodeposition.

Moreover, tensor representation of\nthe electrostatic potential enables usage of large 3D Cartesian grids (of the\norder of $n^3 \\sim 10^{12}$), which could allow the accurate modeling of\ncomplexes with several large proteins. In our approach selection of the correct\ngeometric pose predictions in the localized posing process is based on the\ncontrol of van der Waals distance between the target molecular clusters. Here,\nwe confine ourselves by constrained minimization of the energy functional by\nusing only fast tensor-based free-space electrostatic energy recalculation for\nvarious rotations and translations of both clusters. Numerical tests of the\nelectrostatic energy-based ``protein-ligand docking'' algorithm applied to\nsynthetic and realistic input data present a proof of concept for rather\ncomplex particle configurations. The method may be used in the framework of the\ntraditional stochastic or deterministic posing/docking techniques."}

This\ndrive towards greater fidelity, however, conflicts with a simultaneous push\ntowards greater model representation of inherent complexity in decision making,\nincluding methods like Modelling to Generate Alternatives (MGA). MGA aims to\nmap the feasible space of a model within a cost slack by varying investment\nparameters without changing the operational constraints, a process which\nfrequently requires hundreds of solutions. For large, detailed energy system\nmodels this is impossible with traditional methods, leading researchers to\nreduce complexity with linearized investments and zonal or temporal\naggregation. This research presents a new solution method for MGA type problems\nusing cutting-plane methods based on a tailored reformulation of Benders\nDecomposition. We accelerate the algorithm by sharing cuts between MGA master\nproblems and grouping MGA objectives. We find that our new solution method\nconsistently solves MGA problems times faster and requires less memory than\nexisting monolithic Modelling to Generate Alternatives solution methods on\nlinear problems, enabling rapid computation of a greater number of solutions to\nhighly resolved models. We also show that our novel cutting-plane algorithm\nenables the solution of very large MGA problems with integer investment\ndecisions."}

In this work, we report the\nformation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either\nof these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki\nchain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact\nferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy\nin its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization\ngroup simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping\nthis model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic\ncalculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced\nkinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic\nmagnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak\nmixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in\ntopological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum\ngeometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers."}

The most\nintriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair\nformed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point\nout the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets,\ndubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\\nu=-2-x$, there is a\ntwo-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a\npaired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon,\nwhile additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to\nan intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative\nLuttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a\nrenormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal\nstate of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL\nphase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the\nsFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers.\nInterestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal\n$p_x$-pairing symmetry. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified\ntheory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap\nnematic superconductivity below it."}

The spatial inhomogeneity is\nintroduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear\ncombinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of\nthe Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and\nholographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and\nnon-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, \"M\\\"obius-type\"\ndeformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic\nrevivals in the integrable one. In contrast, \"sine-square-type\" and\n\"displacement-type\" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling,\ninstead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns\nemerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap\ninitial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the\ndeformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details.\nFinally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity\nusing AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our\n(1+1)-dimensional study."}
