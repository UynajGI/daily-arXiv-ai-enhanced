They occur close to the magnetic $T_c$ in low carrier density local moment magnets when the electron-spin coupling is comparable to the hopping scale. In non disordered systems the primary signatures are a modest non-monotonicity in the temperature dependent resistivity $ρ(T)$, and a magnetoresistance that can be $\\sim 20-30 \\%$ at $T_c$, at fields that, in energy units, are $\\sim 0.01 k_BT_c$. We find that structural disorder, in the form of pinning centers, promotes polaron formation, hugely increases the resistivity peak at $T_c$, and can enhance the magnetoresistance to $\\sim 80\\%$. The change in magnetoresistance with disorder is, however, non-monotonic. Too much disorder just creates an Anderson insulator - with the resistivity unresponsive to the magnetisation. This paper establishes the optimum disorder for maximising the magnetoresistance, suggests the physical process behind the unusual disorder dependence, and provides a magnetoresistance map - in terms of coupling and disorder - that locates some of the existing magnetic semiconductors within this framework."}

We investigate this model in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fermionic infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS) approach, which offers direct access to the stability of the emergent correlated states at the thermodynamic limit. Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \\approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility.

Compared to chemical or mechanical approaches, ultrafast optical excitation further promises a path to create and manipulate novel non-equilibrium phases with ultimate spatiotemporal precision. However, achieving a truly nonvolatile electronic phase transition in laser-excited Mott systems remains an elusive challenge. Here, we present a highly robust and reversible method for optical control of the Mott state in van der Waals systems. Specifically, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a nonvolatile Mott-to-metallic transition in the ultrafast laser-excited charge density wave (CDW) material 1T-TaSe2. Complementary theoretical calculations reveal that this transition originates from a rearrangement of the interlayer CDW stacking. This new stacking order, formed following the ultrafast quenching of the CDW, circumvents the need for large-scale atomic sliding. Intriguingly, it introduces a significant in-plane component to the electron hopping and effectively reduces the ratio of on-site Coulomb interaction to bandwidth, thereby suppressing the Mott state and stabilizing a metallic phase. Our results establish optical-control of interlayer stacking as a versatile strategy for inducing nonvolatile phase transitions, opening a new route to tailor correlated electronic phases and realize reconfigurable high-frequency devices."}

The consistency assumption states that there are no hidden versions of treatment and that the outcome arising naturally equals the outcome arising from intervention.

In the context of surgery, for example, genomic variables are covariates and the skill of a particular surgeon is a version of treatment. There may be hidden versions of treatment, and this paper addresses that concern with a new kind of sensitivity analysis. Whereas many methods for sensitivity analysis are focused on confounding by unmeasured covariates, the methodology of this paper is focused on confounding by hidden versions of treatment. In this paper, new mathematical notation is introduced to support the novel method, and example applications are described."}

The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing."}

Attackers commonly target systems and infrastructure through methods such as malware, ransomware, or other forms of technical exploitation. Most traditional mechanisms to counter these threats rely on post-hoc detection and mitigation strategies, responding to cyber incidents only after they occur rather than preventing them proactively. Recent trends reveal social media discussions can serve as reliable indicators for detecting such threats. Malicious actors often exploit online platforms to distribute attack tools, share attack knowledge and coordinate. Experts too, often predict ongoing attacks and discuss potential breaches in online spaces. In this work, we present SENTINEL, a framework that leverages social media signals for early detection of cyber attacks. SENTINEL aligns cybersecurity discussions to realworld cyber attacks leveraging multi modal signals, i.e., combining language modeling through large language models and coordination markers through graph neural networks. We use data from 16 public channels on Telegram related to cybersecurity and open source intelligence (OSINT) that span 365k messages. We highlight that social media discussions involve active dialogue around cyber threats and leverage SENTINEL to align the signals to real-world threats with an F1 of 0.89.

We study an energy harvesting system comprising a small variable capacitor (e.g., free standing graphene) wired to two diodes and two storage capacitors that may be kept at different temperatures (or at a single one) and use two current loops. The system reaches very rapidly a quasi stationary state with constant overall charge while the difference of the charges at the storage capacitors evolves much more slowly to its stationary value. In this paper, we extract an exponentially small factor out of the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation and use a Chapman-Enskog procedure to describe the long evolution of the marginal probability density for the charge difference, from the quasi stationary state to the final stationary state (thermal equilibrium for equal temperatures). The second paper of this series shows that the results of the perturbation procedure compare well with direct numerical simulations. For a specific form of the diodes' nonlinear mobilities, we can approximate the quasi stationary state by Gaussian functions and further study the evolution of the marginal probability density.

Within such heterogeneous media, the equilibrium equation governed by the divergence of the stress tensor is reduced to a vector-valued quasilinear partial differential equation, wherein significant gradients and nonlinearities are introduced into the governing constitutive relations by spatial density variations. To ensure that these localized field variables are accurately captured, an automated $hp$-refinement strategy is implemented so that element sizes ($h$) and polynomial degrees ($p$) are concurrently optimized. A dual-indicator approach is employed by the framework. In this approach, $h$-refinement is driven by the Kelly error estimator, which utilizes the jump of the normal derivative across element interfaces, while $p$-refinement is determined by the decay of Legendre-Fourier coefficients to assess the local smoothness of the solution. Optimal convergence rates are ensured by this dual-refinement strategy, particularly within the singular regions surrounding the crack tip where material heterogeneities and geometric discontinuities intersect. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated across three distinct loading regimes: pure tensile (Mode I), pure shear (Mode II), and mixed-mode loading. It is demonstrated through numerical simulations that the intricate interaction between the fracture process zone and the underlying material heterogeneities is effectively resolved by the $hp$-adaptive scheme.

Quantum embedding (QE) theories address this limitation by mapping the system onto an auxiliary embedding Hamiltonian (EH) describing fragment-environment interactions, but the EH is typically large and its iterative solution is the primary computational bottleneck. We introduce a linear foundation model for QE that utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) to compress the space of quantum states needed to solve the EH within a small variational subspace. Using a data-driven active-learning scheme, we learn this subspace from EH ground states and reduce each embedding solve to a deterministic ground-state eigenvalue problem in the reduced space. Within the ghost Gutzwiller approximation (ghost-GA), we show for a three-orbital Hubbard model that a variational space learned on a Bethe lattice is transferable to square and cubic lattices without additional training, while substantially reducing the cost of the EH step. We further validate the approach on plutonium, where a single variational space reproduces the energetics of all six crystalline phases while reducing the cost of the EH solution by orders of magnitude. This provides a practical route to overcome the main computational bottleneck of QE frameworks, paving the way for high-throughput ab initio simulations of strongly correlated materials at a near-DFT cost."}

While current psychometric practices report item-level statistics, they often report these raw descriptives separately rather than consolidating both mean and standard deviation into a single diagnostic tool to directly measure item quality. By leveraging the analytical properties of Cohen's d, this article repurposes its use in scale development as a standardized item deviation index. This measures the extent of an item's raw deviation relative to its scale midpoint while accounting for its own uncertainty. Analytical properties such as boundedness, scale invariance, and bias are explored to further understand how the index values behave, which will aid future efforts to establish empirical thresholds that characterize redundancy among formative indicators and consistency among reflective indicators."}

Building on the scaling strategy from our previous work, where we tailored a VQE workflow to both the DPO formulation and the target QPU, we now put forward two significant advances. The first is the implementation of the Ising Sample-based Quantum Configuration Recovery (ISQR) routine, which improves solution quality in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems. The second is the use of the VQE Constrained method to decompose the optimization task, enabling us to handle DPO instances with more variables than the available qubits on current hardware. These advances, which are broadly applicable to other optimization problems, allow us to address a portfolio with a size relevant to the financial industry, consisting of up to 38 assets and covering the full Spanish stock index (IBEX 35). Our results, obtained on a real Quantum Processing Unit (IBM Fez), show that this tailored workflow achieves financial performance on par with classical methods while delivering a broader set of high-quality investment strategies, demonstrating a viable path towards obtaining practical advantage from quantum optimization in real financial applications."}

On many platforms, accessible Hamiltonians are largely restricted to one- and two-body interactions, limiting access to multi-body Hamiltonians and to systems governed by simultaneous, non-commuting interaction terms that are central to condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes. We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions. Our hardware-agnostic and scalable method opens new routes to realizing complex many-body physics across quantum platforms."}

Using a 15-year panel of 33 European countries (2010--2024) and two-way fixed effects with Driscoll--Kraay standard errors, we document a fundamental transformation in broadband demand. Pre-COVID, Eastern Partnership countries exhibited highly elastic demand ($\\varepsilon = -0.61$, p$<$0.001) -- a 10\\% price reduction increased subscriptions by 6\\% -- while EU countries showed moderate elasticity ($\\varepsilon = -0.12$, p$<$0.05). By 2020--2024, both regions converged to near-zero elasticity, with price changes having no detectable effect on adoption.

This is achieved by constructing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that dynamically adjusts the price. A key feature of our modeling framework is that customers may choose to balk - that is, decide not to join - when facing high congestion. A notable strength of our approach is that the revenue-maximizing algorithm relies solely on information about effective arrivals, meaning that only the behavior of customers who choose not to balk is observable and used in decision-making. This results in an elaborate interplay between the pricing policy and the effective arrival process, yielding a non-standard state dependent queueing process. An important contribution of our work concerns a novel Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) procedure that is able to consistently estimate the stationary effective arrival rate. This is further leveraged to construct an iterative algorithm that converges, under mild regularity conditions, to the optimal price with provable asymptotic guarantees."}

But when more than two energy levels are available per site, disorder can induce resonances that locally enhance mobility. Here we explore phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions on a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control. Compressibility measurements distinguish an incompressible Mott insulator from surrounding compressible phases and reveal signatures of glassiness, reflected in non-ergodic behavior. Spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements identify regions of the phase diagram with a non-vanishing condensate fraction. We also visualize the spectrum by measuring the dynamical structure factor. A linearly-dispersing phonon mode materializes in the superfluid, appearing even when disorder is introduced to the clean Mott insulator. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for disorder-induced superfluidity."}

Policymakers, moderators and researchers have taken various routes to fight these campaigns and make online systems safer for regular users. To this end, our paper presents ALETHEIA, a system that formalizes the detection of malicious accounts (or troll accounts) used in such operations and forecasts their behaviors within social media networks. We analyze influence campaigns on Reddit and X from different countries and highlight that detection pipelines built over a graph-based representation of campaigns using a mix of topological and linguistic features offer improvement over standard interaction and user features. ALETHEIA uses state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for detecting malicious users that can scale to large networks and achieve a 3.7% F1-score improvement over standard classification with interaction features in prior work. Furthermore, ALETHEIA employs a first temporal link prediction mechanism built for influence campaigns by stacking a GNN over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which can predict future troll interactions towards other trolls and regular users with an average AUC of 96.6%. ALETHEIA predicts troll-to-troll edges (TTE) and troll-to-user edges (TUE), which can help identify regular users being affected by malicious influence efforts. Overall, our results highlight the importance of utilizing the networked nature of influence operations (i.e., structural information) when predicting and detecting malicious coordinated activity in online spaces."}

We evaluate the two-body color density matrix $ρ$ of static quarks, and investigate the dependence of color correlations on the quarks' spatial configuration. As a result, we find that the color correlations depend on the minimal path length along a flux tube which connects two quarks under consideration. The color correlation between quarks quenches because of color leak into the gluon field (flux tube) and finally approaches the random color configuration in the large distance limit.

Using the Fubini-Study formalism, we derive the metric tensor of the associated quantum state manifold and compute the corresponding Riemann curvature. Our analysis reveals that the system evolves over a smooth, compact, two-dimensional manifold with spherical topology and a dumbbell-like structure shaped by collective spin interactions. We further investigate the influence of the geometry and topology of the resulting state space on the behavior of geometric and topological phases acquired by the system. We explore how this curvature constrains the system's dynamical behavior, including its evolution speed and Fubini-Study distance between the quantum states. Within this geometric framework, we address the quantum brachistochrone problem and derive the minimal time required for optimal evolution, a result useful for time-efficient quantum circuit design. Subsequently, we explore the role of entanglement in shaping the state space geometry, modulating geometric phase, and controlling evolution speed and brachistochrone time. Our results reveal that entanglement enhances dynamics up to a critical threshold, beyond which geometric constraints begin to hinder evolution. Moreover, entanglement induces critical shifts in the geometric phase, making it a sensitive indicator of entanglement levels and a practical tool for steering quantum evolution. This approach offers valuable guidance for developing quantum technologies that require time-efficient control strategies rooted in the geometry of quantum state space."}

Using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, a prototypical metal-insulator transition manganite, we show that local low-dose focused ion beam irradiation increases resistivity by several orders of magnitude, converting the ferromagnetic-metal ground state into a paramagnetic-insulator. Surprisingly, we found that applying electric stimuli to the irradiated material induces a non-thermal insulator-to-metal transition, which results in low-power, repeatable volatile resistive switching. Magnetotransport measurements revealed that this voltage-induced metallic phase in the irradiated material is ferromagnetic, exhibiting clear anisotropic magnetoresistance. This work, thus, reports the discovery of a unique material in which the electrical triggering of the electronic phase transition results in the onset of magnetism, in stark contrast to the magnetic order suppression commonly observed in other metal-insulator transition switching materials. We demonstrate that local focused ion beam irradiation provides new and exciting opportunities to engineer electronic and magnetic functionalities that can find practical applications ranging from spintronics to neuromorphic hardware."}

The total action is local on $Λ$, gauge invariant, and depends on $x$ only through Euclidean invariants built from edge vectors (local metrics, volumes, etc.), hence the partition function is exactly covariant under the global Euclidean group SE(d) at any lattice spacing. The intended symmetry-restoring mechanism is not rigid global zero modes but short-range *local twisting* of the embedding that mixes local orientations; accordingly, our universality discussion is conditioned on a short-range geometry hypothesis (SR): after quotienting the global SE(d) modes, connected correlators of local geometric observables have correlation length O(1) in lattice units.\n  We prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system with embedding $x$ and generic gauge/matter fields $(U,Φ)$ in finite volume by treating $x$ as an additional multiplet of scalar fields on $Λ$.

In many real-world scenarios, however, distinct features in the target and source domains can play similar predictive roles, creating a form of cross-semantic similarity. To leverage this broader transferability, we propose the Cross-Semantic Transfer Learning (CSTL) framework. It captures potential relationships by comparing each target coefficient with all source coefficients through a weighted fusion penalty. The weights are derived from the derivative of the SCAD penalty, effectively approximating an ideal weighting scheme that preserves transferable signals while filtering out source-specific noise. For computational efficiency, we implement CSTL using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Theoretically, we establish that under mild conditions, CSTL achieves the oracle estimator with overwhelming probability. Empirical results from simulations and a real-data application confirm that CSTL outperforms existing methods in both cross-semantic and partial signal similarity settings."}

This yields a direct link to rate-distortion theory and shows that Shannon entropy emerges endogenously as the honest local utility for predictive refinement. Bernardo's characterization of proper local scoring rules together with Shannon's amalgamation invariance imply that the logarithmic score, and hence mutual information, is the unique information measure consistent with coherent prediction under refinement of the state space. Information costs, therefore, need not be assumed: they arise as expected predictive utility. Within this framework we establish a supported complete-class result: the optimal policies are Gibbs-Boltzmann channels, with the classical rational-inattention family recovered as a special case. Canonical models appear as geometric specializations of the same structure, including multinomial logit (and IIA) under entropic regularization, James-Stein shrinkage as optimal capacity allocation in Gaussian learning, and linear-quadratic-Gaussian control as the capacity-optimal Gaussian channel. Overall, the Bayesian predictive formulation reframes bounded rationality as an optimal design principle: finite information capacity is an endogenous solution to a well-posed predictive problem, and behaviors often attributed to cognitive frictions, soft choice, regularization, sparsity, and screening arise as rational responses to the geometry of predictive refinement."}

We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels. With the repetition and toric codes as examples, we use our approach to analytically rank logical error rates and thresholds between code implementations with standard and dynamic syndrome extraction circuits, describe the effect of transversal logical Clifford gates on logical error rates, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate maximum likelihood thresholds.

However, the goal is largely hindered by the difficulty to characterize the system's operating flexibility due to the complex building thermal dynamics, system operating limits and human comfort constraints. To address this challenge, this paper develops an unified virtual battery (VB) modeling framework for characterizing the operating flexibility of both single-zone and multi-zone building HVAC systems, enabling flexible buildings to function like virtual batteries. Specifically, a physically meaningful representation state is first identified to represent building thermal conditions under thermal comfort constraints and a VB model is then established for characterizing the operating flexibility of single-zone HVAC systems. We subsequently extend the VB modeling framework to multi-zone HVAC systems and establish a set of zone-level VB models to characterize the building's zonal operating flexibility. We further develop a systematic method to aggregate the VB models into a low-order and low-complexity aggregated VB model, significantly reducing model and computational complexity. We demonstrate the VB model through demand response (DR) applications and conclude that the VB model can well capture the operating flexibility of building HVAC systems and enable effective DR participation. The DR strategies obtained from the VB model can be efficiently decomposed to zone-level control inputs for maintaining human thermal comfort while achieving near-optimal operation cost."}

On many platforms, accessible Hamiltonians are largely restricted to one- and two-body interactions, limiting access to multi-body Hamiltonians and to systems governed by simultaneous, non-commuting interaction terms that are central to condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes. We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions.

But not all disorder is created equal. Disorder can be trivial or constrained, and correlated disorder can even be topological. Crucially, constrained disorder can harbor memory, leading to non-trivial, sequence-dependent responses to external manipulations. And yet the fascinating subject of \"memory of disorder\" remains poorly explored, as memory is often associated to the retention of metastable order. In recent years artificial frustrated materials -- in particular arrays of frustrated nanomagnets known as artificial spin ices -- have been employed to study complex disorders and its wealth of exotic behaviors, yet their memory properties have received much less attention. Here, we investigate both analytically and numerically the sequence-dependent responses of two somehow opposite yet related artificial spin ices: the Landau-ordered square spin ice and the disordered but topologically-ordered Shakti spin ice. We find that Shakti exhibits a pronounced sequence-dependent response, whereas in the square lattice, such path dependence is absent. Within Shakti, even the minimal periodic supercell demonstrates both deterministic and stochastic forms of sequence memory, depending on the interaction strength. Extending our study to cyclic driving, we find that retracing the same input path leads to enhanced memory retention. These results open new perspectives on how topological constraints and correlated disorder generate robust memory effects in frustrated artificial materials, hitherto examined mainly in terms of their ground-state kinetics and thermodynamics."}

However, due to curvature variations and continuity limitations of the boundary surfaces, the Jacobian determinant of a Coons volume may locally vanish or become negative, resulting in a non-regular mapping. This undermines mesh quality and compromises the stability of subsequent numerical computations. Ensuring the regularity of Coons volumes is therefore critical for robust parametric modeling. This paper develops a systematic framework for analyzing and verifying the regularity of Coons volumes. We first derive a general sufficient condition applicable to arbitrary boundary parameterizations, independent of specific analytical forms. For Bézier-form Coons volumes, we introduce a criterion based on the Bézier coefficients of the Jacobian determinant, transforming the verification problem into checking the positivity of control coefficients. Furthermore, we construct a necessary condition by applying a subdivision strategy combined with the Bézier blossoming technique, ensuring that regularity is preserved in all subdomains. By integrating these conditions, we design an efficient verification algorithm whose correctness and computational performance are validated through numerical experiments. We observe that the regularity of a Coons volume is closely related to the geometric similarity of its opposite boundary surfaces. Moreover, through Bézier extraction, the algorithm is extended to multi-patch B-spline volumes of arbitrary topology. Numerical tests show that the method completes regularity verification in milliseconds, enabling real-time application."}

However, the goal is largely hindered by the difficulty to characterize the system's operating flexibility due to the complex building thermal dynamics, system operating limits and human comfort constraints. To address this challenge, this paper develops an unified virtual battery (VB) modeling framework for characterizing the operating flexibility of both single-zone and multi-zone building HVAC systems, enabling flexible buildings to function like virtual batteries. Specifically, a physically meaningful representation state is first identified to represent building thermal conditions under thermal comfort constraints and a VB model is then established for characterizing the operating flexibility of single-zone HVAC systems. We subsequently extend the VB modeling framework to multi-zone HVAC systems and establish a set of zone-level VB models to characterize the building's zonal operating flexibility. We further develop a systematic method to aggregate the VB models into a low-order and low-complexity aggregated VB model, significantly reducing model and computational complexity. We demonstrate the VB model through demand response (DR) applications and conclude that the VB model can well capture the operating flexibility of building HVAC systems and enable effective DR participation. The DR strategies obtained from the VB model can be efficiently decomposed to zone-level control inputs for maintaining human thermal comfort while achieving near-optimal operation cost."}

Here we investigate the effects of multiple anisotropic exchange interactions on topological magnon in a honeycomb ferromagnet, and find a chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition induced by a complicated interplay of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI), accompanied by the bulk gap close and reopen with chiral inversion. Moreover, this novel topological phase transition involves band inversion at high symmetry points $K$ and $K'$, which can be regarded as a pseudo-orbital reversal, i.e. magnon valley degree of freedom, implying a new manipulation corresponding to a sign change of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity. Indeed, it can be realized in 4$d$ or 5$d$ correlated materials with both spin-orbit coupling and orbital localized states, such as iridates and ruthenates, etc. This novel regulation may have potential applications on magnon devices and topological magnonics."}

While surrogate labels provide cost-effective alternatives, their noise can introduce non-negligible bias. To address this challenge, we propose the surrogate-powered inference (SPI) toolbox, a unified framework that leverages both the validity of high-quality labels and the abundance of surrogates to enable reliable statistical inference. SPI comprises three progressively enhanced versions. Base-SPI integrates validated labels and surrogates through augmentation to improve estimation efficiency. SPI+ incorporates regularized regression to safely handle multiple surrogates, preventing performance degradation due to error accumulation. SPI++ further optimizes efficiency under limited validation budgets through an adaptive, multiwave labeling procedure that prioritizes informative subjects for labeling. Compared to traditional methods, SPI substantially reduces the estimation error and increases the power in risk factor identification. These results demonstrate the value of SPI in improving the reproducibility. Theoretical guarantees and extensive simulation studies further illustrate the properties of our approach."}

But when more than two energy levels are available per site, disorder can induce resonances that locally enhance mobility. Here we explore phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions on a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control. Compressibility measurements distinguish an incompressible Mott insulator from surrounding compressible phases and reveal signatures of glassiness, reflected in non-ergodic behavior. Spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements identify regions of the phase diagram with a non-vanishing condensate fraction.

This study develops an entropy-based statistical framework to analyze static and temporal dependencies between urban air pollutants and meteorological variables across multiple Indian cities. Dependence is quantified using complementary linear and nonlinear measures, including Pearson correlation, mutual information, and relative conditional entropy. A key methodological contribution is a PCA based composite indexing framework that integrates these heterogeneous metrics into a unified and interpretable correlation score. For each pollutant meteorological pair within a city, PCA is used to extract a joint variability index, while spatial variability is assessed by aggregating correlations across cities. These indices are further combined to derive a comprehensive city-level correlation score that represents overall pollutant meteorology coupling strength and enables classification of cities into distinct interaction regimes. Sensitivity analysis, performed by systematically excluding individual variable pairs, demonstrates the robustness of the framework, with no single pair exerting disproportionate influence. Temporal dependencies are examined using transfer entropy and time-delayed mutual information. Results indicate that relative humidity generally leads changes in pollutant concentrations, whereas ambient temperature tends to lag, highlighting contrasting causal influences. Mutual information peaks at zero lag and decays rapidly, indicating strong short term interactions with limited persistence. Overall, the proposed framework provides a unified and interpretable approach for assessing complex pollutant meteorology interactions across diverse locations and time."}

By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges.\n  We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N>4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases."}

Zwanzig's well-known classic mean-field theory predicts that roughness reduces the diffusion coefficient by an exponential factor determined solely by the variance of the disorder. However, the numerical studies of Banerjee, Seki, and Bagchi (BSB) showed that this result fails for uncorrelated Gaussian-distributed site energies because rare but deep three-site traps dominate long-time transport. BSB introduced Gaussian \\emph{spatial} correlations - originally developed in astrophysics to model turbulent density fluctuations - and demonstrated that even modest correlations suppress these pathological traps and restore Zwanzig's exponential scaling. Here we present here a unified theoretical framework clarifying (i) why Zwanzig's local averaging, may be viewed as a Gaussian cumulant expansion, could breakdown. In particular, how its validity is destroyed by uncorrelated disorder, and (ii) how Gaussian spatial correlations reshape roughness increments, eliminate asymmetric multi-site traps, and thereby recover mean-field diffusion, and (iii) a derivation showing exactly how Gaussian spatial correlations modify roughness increments, trap statistics, and ultimately the diffusion constant.

We show that these experimental observations are well-captured by the layered t-J-V model, which extends the standard t-J framework to include the long-range Coulomb interaction V and the layered structure.\n  This new perspective elucidates how charge dynamics renormalizes one-particle excitation properties, leading to several profound and often counterintuitive consequences. We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band.\n  We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach. This perspective on plasmon excitations may offer a critically new clue to a long-standing puzzle: why multi-layer cuprate superconductors, containing more than two CuO2 layers per unit cell, consistently exhibit a higher critical temperature Tc than their single-layer counterparts.

However, in many biomedical applications based on real-world data, populations under consideration in different studies, e.g., clinical sites, can be heterogeneous, leading to challenges in properly borrowing information towards the target study. The state of art methods are typically based on study-level matching to identify source studies that are similar to the target study, whilst samples from source studies that significantly differ from the target study will all be dropped at the study level, which can lead to substantial loss of information. We consider a general situation where all studies are sampled from a super-population composed of distinct subpopulations, and propose a novel framework of targeted learning via subpopulation matching. In contrast to the existing study-level matching methods, measuring similarities between subpopulations can effectively decompose both within- and between-study heterogeneity, allowing incorporation of information from all source studies without dropping any samples as in the existing methods. We devise the proposed framework as a two-step procedure, where a finite mixture model is first fitted jointly across all studies to provide subject-wise probabilistic subpopulation information, followed by a step of within-subpopulation information transferring from source studies to the target study for each identified subpopulation. We establish the non-asymptotic properties of our estimator and demonstrate the ability of our method to improve prediction at the target study via simulation studies."}

We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility. We establish the fusion algebra of these defects. Finally, in constructing the non-invertible duality transformation, we explicitly verify that it acts as a partial isometry on the physical Hilbert space, thereby satisfying a recent generalization of Wigner's theorem applicable to non-invertible symmetries."}

The sensor observes the process and sends encoded observations to the estimator as packets over an unreliable communication channel modeled as the Gilbert-Elliot (GE) channel. We assume that the sensor gets to observe the channel state by the ACK/NACK feedback mechanism only when it attempts a transmission while it does not observe the channel state when no transmission attempt is made. The objective is to design a transmission scheduling strategy for the sensor, and an estimation strategy for the estimator that are jointly optimal, i.e., they minimize the expected value of an infinite-horizon cumulative discounted cost defined as the sum of squared estimation error over time and the sensor's transmission power. Since the sensor and the estimator have access to different information sets, this constitutes a decentralized stochastic control problem. We formulate this problem as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) and show the existence of jointly optimal transmission and estimation strategies that have a simple structure. More specifically, an optimal transmission strategy exhibits a threshold structure, i.e., the sensor attempts a transmission only when its belief about the channel being in a good state exceeds a threshold that depends on a certain error. Moreover, an optimal estimation strategy follows a `Kalman-like' update rule. When the channel parameters are unknown, we exploit this structure to design an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm that converges to a locally optimal policy. Simulations show the learned policy performs close to a globally optimal one, with about a 5.5% average relative gap across evaluated parameters."}

Advances in this field have clarified that doped charges in cuprates exhibit remarkably rich collective behavior, governed by the combined effects of strong electronic correlations, the intrinsic layered crystal structure, and long-range Coulomb interaction. First, the emergence of acousticlike plasmons has been firmly established through quantitative analyses of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra based on the t-J-V model -- an extension of the conventional t-J model that incorporates the layered crystal structure and the long-range Coulomb interaction V. These acousticlike plasmons arise near the in-plane momentum q=(0,0) and possess characteristic energies far below the well-known ~ 1 eV optical plasmon. This behavior is found to be universal across both hole- and electron-doped cuprates, including multilayer systems. Second, in electron-doped cuprates, a pronounced tendency toward d-wave bond-charge order develops near q=(0.5pi, 0), as revealed by resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) and RIXS. As a result, the charge dynamics acquires a dual structure, in which low-energy bond-charge excitations coexist with relatively high-energy plasmons. Third, analogous signatures of charge-order tendency have also been reported in hole-doped cuprates. However, a direct application of the d-wave bond-charge-order framework fails to account for experimental observations. Similarly, the charge-stripe order in La-based cuprates remains unresolved within existing theoretical approaches. Assuming that mobile carriers behave in a largely universal manner across electron- and hole-doped systems, we discuss a possible scenario that may reconcile these diverse experimental findings."}

However, sharing individual-level data across sites is often difficult due to patient privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions. To overcome this challenge, many distributed algorithms, that fit a global model by only communicating aggregated information across sites, have been proposed. A major challenge in applying existing distributed algorithms to real-world data is that their validity often relies on the assumption that data across sites are independently and identically distributed, which is frequently violated in practice. In biomedical applications, data distributions across clinical sites can be heterogeneous. Additionally, the set of covariates available at each site may vary due to different data collection protocols. We propose a distributed inference framework for data integration in the presence of both distribution heterogeneity and data structural heterogeneity. By modeling heterogeneous and structurally missing data using density-tilted generalized method of moments, we developed a general aggregated data-based distributed algorithm that is communication-efficient and heterogeneity-aware. We establish the asymptotic properties of our estimator and demonstrate the validity of our method via simulation studies."}

The applied field induces a DC Stark shift that tunes the emission energy over a range exceeding 30 times the inhomogeneous linewidth, effectively compensating for emitter-to-emitter variations. Concurrently, the field stabilizes trap occupancy, yielding a twofold reduction in optical linewidth and the suppression of spectral wandering. A statistical model based on trap dynamics qualitatively reproduces these observations and elucidates the mechanism of field-assisted charge noise suppression.

The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction.

At each step, a single agent is selected asynchronously and averages the values of its current neighbors. A distinctive feature of our model is that an agent's neighborhood may contract following an update, while non-selected agents may add or remove neighbors independently. This creates a time-varying communication structure with endogenous contraction. We show that under mild assumptions--specifically, that the evolving graph is connected infinitely often--the system reaches consensus almost surely. Our results extend classical consensus theory on time-varying graphs and asynchronous updates by introducing selective neighborhood contraction, offering new insights into agreement dynamics in evolving social systems."}

We derive the momentum-dependent multipolar susceptibilities and effective interactions among the localized 4f electrons, based on the framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory. Magnetic fluctuations within the crystalline-electric-field (CEF) ground-state doublet are dominated by q=(1/2,1/2,0), corresponding to a two-dimensional checkerboard configuration of the magnetic moment M_z along the c axis. Hybridization between the CEF ground state and the first-excited doublet gives rise to leading magnetic octupole fluctuations of z(x^2-y^2) symmetry, followed by electric quadrupole fluctuations of x^2-y^2 and {yz, zx} symmetries. By taking into account the anisotropic magnetic-field dependence of the transition temperature T_0, we conclude that an antiferromagnetic order of M_z at q=(1/2,1/2,0) is consistent with the experiments, owing to the enhancement of T_0 caused by fluctuations of the field-induced quadrupole of {yz, zx} type under an in-plane magnetic field."}

Non-reciprocal XCD, in which the dichroic response changes upon reversing the propagation direction of the probe, is generally forbidden in systems with both symmetries. Using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, we identify circularly polarized phonons in ferro-rotational MnTiO$_3$, which we term ferro-rotational phonons. Their excitations provide a direct demonstration of non-reciprocal XCD in a system that globally preserves inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose that a condensate of these phonons, manifested as standing waves, underlies the ferro-rotational order in MnTiO$_3$. The interplay among photon helicity, phonon polarization, and the axial ferro-rotational order gives rise to the observed non-reciprocal circular dichroism."}

To address the intractable likelihood, we develop a tractable inferential framework that avoids label enumeration and direct simulation of the latent state. We exploit a duality between the diffusion and a pure-death process on partitions, together with coagulation operators that encode the effect of new data. These yield closed-form, recursive updates for forward and backward inference. We compute exact posterior distributions of the latent state at arbitrary times and predictive distributions of future or interpolated partitions. This enables online and offline inference and forecasting with full uncertainty quantification, bypassing MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo.

We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes.

In this work, we derive a tight performance bound for magnetic-field sensing with a spin ensemble in the presence of dissipation. The metrological performance is quantified by the integrated metrological gain (IMG), which explicitly incorporates the time evolution of the measurement apparatus. By combining the Lindblad master equation with the quantum Fisher information, we obtain analytically exact trade-off relations between the IMG and the dissipation rate for local dephasing and local emission processes, showing that the gain scales inversely with the dissipation strength. This trade-off complements the Heisenberg limit, which addresses only the scaling with the number of spins and neglects dissipative dynamics. We analyze various initial state preparations and elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in the presence of dissipation. Notably, while entanglement is essential for achieving Heisenberg scaling at short times, it also accelerates dissipative degradation during time evolution. Consequently, for sufficiently long observation times, comparable metrological performance can be achieved even without entanglement."}

We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels. With the repetition and toric codes as examples, we use our approach to analytically rank logical error rates and thresholds between code implementations with standard and dynamic syndrome extraction circuits, describe the effect of transversal logical Clifford gates on logical error rates, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate maximum likelihood thresholds. Our framework offers a universal prescription to analyze, simulate, and compare the decoding properties of any stabilizer circuit, while revealing the innate connections between dynamical quantum systems and noise-resilient phases of matter."}

In this letter, we propose a general and explicit construction recipe for QECCs from a total of D classical codes for arbitrary D. Following this recipe guarantees the obtainment of a QECC within the stabilizer formalism and nearly exhausts all possible constructions. As examples, we demonstrate that our construction recovers the HGP construction when D = 2 and leads to four distinct types of constructions for D = 3, including a previously studied case as one of them. When the input classical codes are repetition codes, our D = 3 constructions unify various three-dimensional lattice models into a single framework, encompassing the three-dimensional toric code model, a fracton model, and two other intriguing models not previously investigated. Among these, two types of constructions exhibit a trade-off between code distance and code dimension for a fixed number of qubits by adjusting the lengths of the different classical codes, and the optimal choice can simultaneously achieve relatively large values for both code distance and code dimension. Our general construction protocol provides another perspective for enriching the structure of QECCs and enables the exploration of richer possibilities for good codes."}

We demonstrate that WFS acts as a dissipative x-ray, quantifying dissipative leakage in molecular polaritons and certifying topological isolation in Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm rings. This establishes that topological protection persists as an algebraic invariant even when the spectral gap is closed."}

The polaron picture is a method capable of analyzing in the entire coupling regime and extracting the essential physics behind the QPT. However, the asymmetric deformation of polarons is missing in the current polaron picture. In the present work we propose an improved variational method in asymmetric polaron picture (APP). Our APP not only increases the method accuracy but also reveals more underlying physics concerning the QPT. We find that in the ground state both the polarons and antipolarons are asymmetrically deformed to a large extent, which leads to a richer phase diagram. We also analyze the first excited state in which we unveil an asymmetry direction reversal for the polarons and an attraction/replusion transition differently from the ground state. Finally, we apply the APP in quantum Fisher information analysis and critical coupling extraction, the improvements indicate that the polaron asymmetry makes a considerable contribution to the quantum resource in quantum metrology and plays an unnegligible role in the QPT. Our results and mechanism clarifications expose more subtle energy competitions and abundant physics, and the method potentially might have broader applications in light-matter interactions."}

The consistency assumption states that there are no hidden versions of treatment and that the outcome arising naturally equals the outcome arising from intervention.

In the context of surgery, for example, genomic variables are covariates and the skill of a particular surgeon is a version of treatment. There may be hidden versions of treatment, and this paper addresses that concern with a new kind of sensitivity analysis. Whereas many methods for sensitivity analysis are focused on confounding by unmeasured covariates, the methodology of this paper is focused on confounding by hidden versions of treatment.

By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges.\n  We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N>4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases."}

By examining the distribution of energy level spacings through the level spacing ratio, we delineate the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes and characterize the emergence of quantum chaos in these systems. Our analysis demonstrates that non-local couplings facilitate faster operator spreading and more intricate dynamical behavior, enabling these systems to approach maximal chaos more readily than their local counterparts. Additionally, we analyze Krylov complexity as a dynamical probe of chaos, observing a characteristic peak followed by a plateau at late times in chaotic regimes. This behavior provides a quantitative means to distinguish between integrable and chaotic phases, with the growth rate and saturation level of the complexity serving as effective indicators. Our findings underscore the role of non-local interactions in accelerating the onset of chaos and modifying dynamical complexity in quantum spin chains."}

The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing."}

Because the approximation ratio depends on the optimal solution, which is typically elusive and difficult to ascertain a priori, the second novel component is to construct the upper bound of the optimal solution through the current quantum state. By enforcing the non-decreasing property of this Lyapunov function, we not only derive a class of quantum dynamics that can be simulated by quantum devices but also obtain rigorous bounds on the achievable approximation ratio. As a concrete demonstration, we apply our framework to Max-Cut problem, implementing it as an adaptive variational quantum algorithm based on a Hamiltonian ansatz. This algorithm avoids ansatz and graph structural assumptions and bypasses parameter training through a tunable parameter function integrated with measurement feedback."}

We examine level populations in both the bare and dressed bases and compute the incoherent resonance-fluorescence spectrum. Our analysis shows that the stochastic drive is not merely a source of decoherence but a versatile control parameter. By detuning the stochastic-field central frequency relative to the coherent drive (especially for narrow bandwidths), we observe pronounced changes in emission characteristics, including selective enhancement or suppression, and reshaping of the multi-peaked fluorescence spectrum when the detuning matches the generalized Rabi frequency.

Whereas this approach is well suited for calculating emission probabilities and cross sections, it is insensitive to spatial and temporal phenomena such as, for instance, radiation formation, quantum coherence, and wave packet spreading. These effects are becoming increasingly important for experiments involving electrons, photons, atoms, and ions, particularly with the advent of attosecond spectroscopy and metrology. Here, we propose a general method for describing the emission of photons in phase space via a Wigner function. Several effects for Cherenkov radiation are predicted, absent in classical realm or in quantum theory in momentum space, such as a finite spreading time of the photon, finite duration of the flash and a quantum shift of the photon arrival time. The photon spreading time turns out to be negative near the Cherenkov angle, the flash duration is defined by the electron packet size, and the temporal shift can be both positive and negative. The characteristic time scales of these effects lie in the atto- and femtosecond ranges, thereby illustrating atomic origins of these macroscopic phenomena. The near-field distribution of the photon field resembles the electron packet shape, thus making ``snapshots'' of the emitter wave function. Our approach can easily be generalized to the other types of radiation and extended to scattering, decay, and annihilation processes, bringing tomographic methods of quantum optics to particle physics."}

Unitary qubit dynamics generated by Hermitian Hamiltonians correspond to elliptic spatial rotations of this effective charge while non-unitary qubit dynamics generated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or stochastic measurement collapse correspond to hyperbolic Lorentz boosts. Notably, to faithfully emulate the stochastic qubit dynamics arising from continuous qubit measurement, the stochastic electromagnetic fields must depend on the velocity of the charge they are acting on. Moreover, continuous qubit measurements admit a dynamical delayed choice effect where a future experimental choice can appear to retroactively determine the type of past measurement backaction, so the corresponding point charge dynamics can also exhibit delayed choice Lorentz transformations in which a future experimental choice determines whether stochastic force fields are electric or magnetic in character long after they interact with the particle."}

We validate our method by analyzing the steerability of two-qubit Werner and two-qutrit isotropic states. For Werner states, our approach saturates the analytical visibility bounds under three Pauli measurements, arbitrary projective measurements (PVMs), and arbitrary positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs). For isotropic states, we achieve the known analytical bounds under arbitrary PVMs. We further investigate the steerability of this class of states under arbitrary POVMs, and our results suggest that POVMs can offer an advantage over PVMs in revealing the steerability of such states."}

However, the dynamics and physical mechanisms governing ergotropy evolution remain open challenges. Here, we investigate the ergotropy of a general QB model and find that the charging process is accompanied by the variation and inversion of the energy level populations. In the absence of population inversion, the ergotropy is fully consistent with coherent ergotropy; in local and global population inversion, it is determined by both coherent and incoherent ergotropy. Via random sampling of quantum states and Hamiltonians, we show that coherence and the participation ratio enhance coherent ergotropy, whereas incoherent ergotropy--whether enhanced, unchanged, or suppressed--depends on diagonal entropy, the participation ratio, and energy level population ordering. We demonstrate that the ergotropy lower bound is incoherent ergotropy, the upper bound is the QB stored energy, and enhanced QB purity suppresses locked energy and boosts charging efficiency. Furthermore, we use the Tavis-Cummings (TC) and Jaynes-Cummings (JC) batteries as paradigms to validate our findings.

Classical systems typically handle contradictions only through external checks or by altering the logical framework, as in Tarski's hierarchy or paraconsistent logics. We propose a novel approach: a quantum circuit architecture that intrinsically enforces logical consistency during its unitary evolution. By encoding self-referential or contradictory propositions into a quantum state, the circuit uses interference effects to suppress inconsistent outcomes while preserving coherent ones. We demonstrate this with the Liar Paradox (\"This statement is false\"), showing that the quantum model naturally stabilizes truth values that would be paradoxical classically. The framework builds on orthomodular quantum logic treating logical propositions as subspace projectors and connects to belief revision and cognitive modeling by providing a physical mechanism for coherence restoration in epistemic states. This work bridges formal logic and quantum computation, suggesting that consistency can be embedded as a structural property of reasoning systems rather than imposed externally."}

In particular, sheaf codes represent a novel framework that encompasses all well-known good qLDPC codes with profound underlying mathematics. In this work, we generalize Poincaré duality from manifolds to both classical and quantum codes defined via sheaf theory on $t$-dimensional cell complexes. Viewing important code properties including the encoding rate, code distance, local testability soundness, and efficient decoders as parameters of the underlying (co)chain complexes, we rigorously prove a duality relationship between the $i$-th chain and the $(t-i)$-th cochain of sheaf codes.\n  We further build multiplicative structures such as cup and cap products on sheaved chain complexes, inspired by the standard notions of multiplicative structures and Poincaré duality on manifolds. This immediately leads to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups of sheaf codes via a cap product. As an application, we obtain transversal disjoint logical $\\mathrm{C}Z$ gates with $k_{\\mathrm{C}Z}=Θ(n)$ on families of good qLDPC and almost-good quantum locally testable codes. Moreover, we provide multiple new methods to construct transversal circuits composed of $\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}Z$ gates as well as for higher order controlled-$Z$ that are provably logical operations on the code space. We conjecture that they generate nontrivial logical actions, pointing towards fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates on nearly optimal qLDPC sheaf codes.

An inner dense silica layer preserves the intrinsic properties of NV centers, while an outer porous silica layer facilitates efficient adsorption and stabilization of hydroxyl radicals and their precursor reactants. By doping this mesoporous shell with gadolinium (III) catalysts, we achieve sustained, light-free generation of hydroxyl radicals via catalytic water splitting, eliminating reliance on external precursors.

Existing approaches involve leveraging network-specific properties, or inflation-based methods whose constraints grow combinatorially in the number of local variables. In this work, we introduce a linear programming witness for network nonlocality built from five classes of linear constraints.

We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels.

Many of the core protocols of quantum information science (such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, and certain algorithms in quantum computing) rely on entanglement. Gisin's theorem tells us that as long as we successfully prepare a pure entangled state, we then have a Bell-nonlocality resource that can show the non-classical correlations. Such a resource is not ``virtual'' and can be tested and used through Bell-experiments. Similarly, in this work, we present a Gisin-like fundamental theorem on EPR steering, which indicates all rank-2 (and rank-1) entangled states possess EPR steerability.

In this paper, we propose an enhanced distributed variational quantum eigensolver for large-scale MaxCut problems, which extends our prior distributed variational quantum eigensolver framework by integrating a novel hybrid classical-quantum perturbation strategy, enhances optimization scalability and efficiency. Our algorithm solves weighted MaxCut instances with up to 1000 vertices using only 10 qubits, and numerical results indicate that it consistently outperforms the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. We further employ a warm-start initialization strategy, seeding the algorithm with high-quality solutions from the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, with results confirming that the optimal classical solution can be effectively further improved. The practical utility of the proposed algorithm is further validated through its application to haplotype phasing on genome sequencing data of the human ABCA1 gene, producing high-quality haplotypes that rival those obtained by the Goemans-Williamson algorithm with $10^6$ projections. These results establish the proposed algorithm as a scalable, NISQ-compatible framework for near-term quantum-enhanced large-scale combinatorial optimization."}

In a magneto-optical trap, we excite the atoms to the center of a manifold of nearly harmonically spaced clusters of Stark energy levels and then allow them to equilibrate.

Following this recipe guarantees the obtainment of a QECC within the stabilizer formalism and nearly exhausts all possible constructions. As examples, we demonstrate that our construction recovers the HGP construction when D = 2 and leads to four distinct types of constructions for D = 3, including a previously studied case as one of them. When the input classical codes are repetition codes, our D = 3 constructions unify various three-dimensional lattice models into a single framework, encompassing the three-dimensional toric code model, a fracton model, and two other intriguing models not previously investigated.
