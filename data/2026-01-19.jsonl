This work examines the role of independent avatars (autonomous digital entities capable of managing social interactions on behalf of users), to optimize social time allocation and reshape Metaverse-based Online Social Networks. We propose a novel computational model that integrates a quantitative and realistic representation of user social life, grounded in evolutionary anthropology, with a framework for avatar-mediated interactions. Our model quantifies the effectiveness of a partial replacement of in-person interactions with independent avatar interactions. Additionally, it accounts for social conflicts and specific socialization constraints. We leverage our model to explore the benefits and trade-offs of an avatar-augmented social life in the Metaverse. Since the exact problem formulation leads to an NP-hard optimization problem when incorporating avatars into the social network, we tackle this challenge by introducing a heuristic solution. Through simulations, we compare avatar-mediated and non-avatar-mediated social networking, demonstrating the potential of independent avatars to enhance social connectivity and efficiency. Our findings provide a foundation for optimizing Metaverse-based social interactions, as well as useful insights for future digital social network design."}

For example, existing works frequently focus on single or a few interventions, due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. As a result, researchers must typically collect the necessary data for each new study, which limits opportunities for systematic comparisons. To overcome these challenges, we introduce The Big Ban Theory (TBBT), a large dataset of moderation interventions. TBBT covers 25 interventions of varying type, severity, and scope, comprising in total over 339K users and nearly 39M posted messages. For each intervention, we provide standardized metadata and pseudonymized user activity collected three months before and after its enforcement, enabling consistent and comparable analyses of intervention effects. In addition, we provide a descriptive exploratory analysis of the dataset, along with several use cases of how it can support research on content moderation. With this dataset, we aim to support researchers studying the effects of moderation interventions and to promote more systematic, reproducible, and comparable research.

Here, we investigate whether hiding liker identities increases the number of likes received by high-reputational-risk content, content for which public endorsement may carry high social or reputational costs due to its topic (e.g., politics) or the account context in which it appears (e.g., partisan accounts). To this end, we conduct two complementary studies: 1) a Difference-in-Differences analysis of engagement with 154,122 posts by 1068 accounts before and after the policy change. 2) a within-subject survey experiment with 203 X users on participants' self-reported willingness to like different kinds of content. We find no detectable platform-level increase in likes for high-reputational-risk content (Study 1). This finding is robust for both between-group comparison of high- versus low-reputational-risk accounts and within-group comparison across engagement types (i.e., likes vs. reposts). Additionally, while participants in the survey experiment report modest increases in willingness to like high-reputational-risk content under private versus public visibility, these increases do not lead to significant changes in the group-level average likelihood of liking posts (Study 2). Taken together, our results suggest that hiding likes produces a limited behavioral response at the platform level. This may be caused by a gap between user intention and behavior, or by engagement driven by a narrow set of high-usage or automated accounts."}

While current approaches to DA typically apply only to cross-sectional data, many studies feature a longitudinal design to better understand the underlying microbial dynamics. To study DA in longitudinal microbial studies, we introduce a novel varying coefficient mixed-effects model with local sparsity. The proposed method can identify time intervals of significant group differences while accounting for temporal dependence. Specifically, we exploit a penalized kernel smoothing approach for parameter estimation and include a random effect to account for serial correlation. In particular, our method operates effectively regardless of whether sampling times are shared across subjects, accommodating irregular sampling and missing observations. Simulation studies demonstrate the necessity of modeling dependence for precise estimation and support recovery. The application of our method to a longitudinal study of mice oral microbiome during cancer development revealed significant scientific insights that were otherwise not discernible through cross-sectional analyses.

While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network."}

In a double regression analysis, both the binary logarithm of carbon dioxide concentration and the geomagnetic aa-index were used as predictors of the sea surface temperature (SST) since the mid-19th century. The regression results turned out to be sensitive to end effects, leading to a broad range of the climate sensitivity between 0.6 K and 1.6 K per doubling of CO$_2$ when varying the final year. The aim of this paper is to narrow down this range. To this end, the correlations between the two predictors and the dependent variable (SST) are analysed in detail. It is demonstrated that the SST can be predicted until around 2000 almost perfectly using only the aa-index, whereas for later periods the role of CO$_2$ increases significantly. Hence, the weight of the aa-index is fixed to its robust outcome (around 0.04 K/nT) from the regressions up to 1990. The SST data, reduced by the aa-contribution thus specified, are then used in a single regression with CO$_2$ as the only remaining predictor. This results in a significant reduction in the range of CO$_2$ sensitivity, narrowing it to 1.1-1.4 K. Given the exceptionally high temperatures in recent years, these values are considered a kind of upper limit that could still be subject to downward corrections when future data are incorporated. Based on this estimate, the temperature forecast until 2100 is refined by using more precise predictions of the aa-index and the paths of atmospheric CO$_2$ content which are based on constant emission scenarios combined with a linear sink model. With the exception of the most ``pessimistic'' variant, the temperature is predicted to remain below the extraordinarily high value measured in 2024."}

Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies."}

This paper presents a qualitative analysis of 'closeness' as it is defined both implicitly and explicitly in interviews with 100 women and/or LGBTQ+ PhD physicists. The interviews include a social network construction component, and we define a quantitative network parameter that serves as a proxy for closeness, which we examine in relation to attributes of network members. We find that physicists in this sample see trust, relaxed boundaries, reliance, and support as concepts that most directly define closeness in their relationships. Consistent interaction, positive affect, and commonalities are also often present in (and in some cases, defining of) these relationships. From the quantitative analysis, we find that these physicists tend to view family and partners, friends, and professional friends as comprising their closest relationships. These results are consistent with other studies which have sought to define closeness qualitatively, but the prevalence of trust in this dataset in particular suggests that these physicists see the ability to confide as uniquely important in their relationships. We make recommendations to institutions supporting and employing physicists on how to better support gender and sexual minority (GSM) physicists going forward, and we believe these results help us gain a better understanding of how GSM physicists find success in physics despite the barriers they face due to their identities."}

Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications. A case study involving 98 chargers at a California academic institution spanning 2018-2024 demonstrates that these metrics reveal persistent \"zombie chargers\" and high-frequency network instability that remain hidden in standard annual reporting."}

Multiscaling has profound implications for financial modelling: it affects extreme risk estimation, influences optimal portfolio allocation across different time horizons, and challenges traditional option pricing approaches that assume uniscaling behaviours. Understanding whether multiscaling arises primarily from the roughness of volatility paths or from the resulting fat-tailed returns has important implications for financial modelling, option pricing, and risk management. This paper investigates the real source of this multiscaling behaviour by introducing a novel two-stage statistical testing procedure. In the first stage, we establish the presence of multiscaling in the rBergomi model against an uniscaling fractional Brownian motion process. We quantify multiscaling by using weighted least squares regression that accounts for heteroscedastic estimation errors across moments. In the second stage, we apply shuffled surrogates that preserve return distributions while destroying temporal correlations. This is done by using distance-based permutation tests robust to asymmetric null distributions. In order to validate our procedure, we check the robustness of the results by using synthetic processes with known multifractal properties, namely the Multifractal Random Walk (MRW) and the Fractional Lévy Stable Motion (FLSM). We provide compelling evidence that multiscaling in the rBergomi model arises primarily from fat-tailed return distributions rather than memory effects. Our findings suggest that the apparent multiscaling in rough volatility models is largely attributable to distributional properties rather than genuine temporal scaling behaviour."}

Convex analysis of these functions focuses on (i) conditions for convexity of the function based on properties of its components, (ii) formulas for the convex conjugate of the function based on those of its components and (iii) chain-rule-like formulas for the sub-differential of the function. To the best of our knowledge all existing results on this matter are based on the notion of K-convexity of functions where K is a closed convex cone. These notions can be considered elementary when K is the non-negative orthant, but otherwise may limit the accessibility of the associated results. In this work we show how standard results on perturbation function based duality can be used to recover and extend existing results without the need for K-convexity. We also provide a detailed comparison with K-convexity based results and show that, while K-convexity is not needed for the convex analysis of composite functions, it certainly aids in verifying the conditions associated with our proposed results.

The BSDE framework offers a computationally efficient alternative to PDE-based methods, and recently proposed deep BSDE solvers, generally utilizing conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), build upon this framework to provide a scalable alternative to numerical BSDE solvers. In this research, we show that although such MLP-based deep BSDEs demonstrate promising results in option pricing, there remains room for improvement regarding hedging performance. To address this issue, we introduce KANHedge, a novel BSDE-based hedger that leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within the BSDE framework. Unlike conventional MLP approaches that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable B-spline activation functions that provide enhanced function approximation capabilities for continuous derivatives. We comprehensively evaluate KANHedge on both European and American basket options across multiple dimensions and market conditions.

We demonstrate that this model is suitable for the description of the experimental data and thus may be employed to determine the strength of the coupling. It results from the increasing overlap of eigenmodes in the QBs penetrating through the opening into the other one, leading to a mixing of their eigenstates, and the breaking of the symmetry present in the QB with integrable dynamics. This implicates deviations of the spectral properties from those of typical quantum systems with integrable and chaotic dynamics, respectively, and approaches those of a fully chaotic system for sufficiently large coupling strength. In contrast in previous studies the transition from integrable to chaotic dynamics was induced by introducing a random potential of increasing strength into such a QB and applicability of a variant of the Rosenzweig-Porter model was tested."}

The current rapid changes in the state of polar sea ice require a better understanding and modeling of these processes and, therefore, accurate measurements of properties including sea ice thickness, density, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. These properties can be measured by tracking the propagation of elastic waves within the ice. Recent technological advances have enabled the use of fiber-optic cables as cost-effective, dense seismic arrays. Once connected to an interrogator unit and mechanically coupled to a medium, here the ice cover, these cables can monitor strain field propagation, using a technique called Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). In this work, we describe the use of such an array of sensors in the coastal ice of the St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada, where a 600 m long optical fiber was deployed across three different morphological sea ice conditions. During hour-long recordings, we measured the propagation of both multi-modal seismic signals generated by active sources and hydro-elastic swell. We computed dispersion curves of active signals and used Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to observe the evolution of swell characteristics in the different ice areas. The dispersion curves were successfully inverted to measure the spatial evolution of ice thickness, and Young's and flexural rigidity in each of these areas. We observed ice thicknesses from 25 cm to 68 cm and Young's modulus values between 4.5 GPa and 5.7 GPa, in good agreement with values derived from collocated geophone arrays and drill hole thickness measurements. DAS systems therefore appear to be effective in evaluating heterogeneous sea ice mechanical properties and thus sea ice formation history and dynamics."}

While regulatory efforts such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program have established uptime requirements, these metrics are often simplistic, delayed, and fail to provide the diagnostic granularity needed by Charging Site Operators (CSOs). Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications. A case study involving 98 chargers at a California academic institution spanning 2018-2024 demonstrates that these metrics reveal persistent \"zombie chargers\" and high-frequency network instability that remain hidden in standard annual reporting."}

While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network."}

Here we study the very closely related problem of a Lévy walker inside annuli or spherical shells with absorbing boundaries.

Leveraging openly available data, we show that half of the research published in top journals has disclosable ties to industry in the form of prior funding, collaboration, or employment. However, the majority of these ties go undisclosed in the published research. These trends do not arise from broad scientific engagement with industry, but rather from a select group of scientists who maintain long-lasting relationships with industry. Undisclosed ties to industry are common not just among authors, but among reviewers and academic editors during manuscript evaluation. Further, industry-tied research garners more attention within the academy, among policymakers, on social media, and in the news. Finally, we find evidence that industry ties are associated with a topical focus away from impacts of platform-scale features. Together, these findings suggest industry influence in social media research is extensive, impactful, and often opaque. Going forward there is a need to strengthen disclosure norms and implement policies to ensure the visibility of independent research, and the integrity of industry supported research."}

Our lattice formulation employs clover fermions, a Symanzik-improved gauge action, and stout-smeared links, which suppress ultraviolet fluctuations and thus enable more accurate determinations of renormalization factors. Our methodology involves computing gauge-variant two-point and three-point Green's functions at one-loop order in lattice perturbation theory, in order to extract the multiplicative renormalization factors and the critical gluino mass. By analyzing lattice discretization effects on the axial current and their dependence on the stout-smearing and clover parameters, we identify a value of the smearing parameter that ensures axial-current conservation at one loop. The results presented in this work provide practical guidance for the fine-tuning procedures required to set up and calibrate lattice simulations of SYM."}

This technique, called cross-fitting, eliminates bias introduced by the use of black-box predictive algorithms. When study units may be correlated, such as in spatial, clustered, or time-series data, investigators often design bespoke forms of cross-fitting to minimize correlation between folds. We prove that, perhaps contrary to popular belief, this is typically unnecessary: performing cross-fitting as if study units were independent usually still eliminates key bias terms even when units may be correlated. In simulation experiments with various correlation structures, we show that causal machine learning estimators typically have the same or improved bias and precision under cross-fitting that ignores correlation compared to techniques striving to eliminate correlation between folds."}

Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $η\\ge 7\\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $η= 2 \\times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches."}

A common heuristic from Kuramoto onset theory and homogeneous parameter swing-equation models is that distributing generation across many smaller units reduces the effective heterogeneity of nodal injections (natural frequencies) and lowers the coupling required for synchronization. Here, using a second-order Kuramoto model, we investigate how decentralization affects frequency synchronization when inertia and damping scale with power generation and consumption. We find that decentralization does not always lower the critical frequency synchronization threshold. Instead, increasing decentralization can induce a non-monotonic dependence of the critical coupling strength and lead to a double phase transition in frequency synchronization. These behaviors remain robust under asymmetric inertia between consumers and generators. Even when empirical power-generation and power-consumption distributions are considered, a region in which the critical threshold remains nearly constant is observed as decentralization increases. Our results demonstrate that decentralization can give rise to complex collective dynamics and caution against assuming that decentralization alone ensures improved frequency synchronization."}

Here, we restrict for the GBs and HGBs to the region of linear dispersion around the Fermi energy, where they are effectively described by the same Dirac equation for massless spin-1/2 particles as NBs. Scarred wave functions of the nonrelativistic billiards and spinor functions of the relativistic ones are localized along the same types of periodic orbits, the most prominent ones being bouncing-ball orbits. The objective is to demonstrate that the properties of the scarred eigenstates observed in the full- and quarter-stadium GB do not comply with those of relativistic quantum systems. For this we apply the semiclassical approach associated with such non-generic contributions, which was developed for the spectral density of QBs and NBs. It provides semiclassical trace formulas in terms of the periodic orbits associated with a scarred wave function and a procedure to extract such contributions from the eigenvalue spectra. Furthermore, we analyze momentum distributions and Husimi functions of such scarred states and employ them to classify scarred wave functions according to the periodic orbits along which they are localized. We show that for the GB the semiclassical approach, the spectral properties, the symmetry properties and generally properties of the wave functions all comply with those of the nonrelativistic QB, whereas for the HGB they agree well with those of the NB, implying that the quantum scars observed in GBs are not relativistic."}

Using the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, which triggered more than 25,000 landslides, we combine three-dimensional modal analysis of 3,130 mountain bodies with a high-resolution landslide inventory. Landslides preferentially occur on mountains whose resonant frequencies (0.5-1.2 Hz) overlap with the dominant frequency content of the earthquake. Mountains affected by landslides exhibit systematically lower resonant frequencies than stable mountains, and larger landslides are associated with lower-frequency mountains. These findings provide quantitative evidence that mountain-scale resonance amplifies seismic ground motion sufficiently to influence landslide triggering, highlighting an overlooked mechanism that should be incorporated into assessments of earthquake-induced landslide hazard."}

Nevertheless, despite extensive scholarship describing conversion, competition, and secularization, there is still no widely adopted formal model that captures religious dynamics over time within a unified, mechanistic framework. In this study, we propose an epidemiologically grounded model of religious change in which religions spread and compete analogously to co-circulating strains. The model extends multi-strain compartmental dynamics by distinguishing passive believers, active missionaries, and religious elites, and by incorporating demographic turnover and mutation-like splitting that endogenously generates new denominations. Using computer simulations, we show that the same mechanism reproduces canonical qualitative regimes, including emergence from rarity, rapid expansion, long-run coexistence, and transient rise-and-fall movements. A reduced calibration variant fits historical affiliation trajectories with parsimonious regime shifts in effective recruitment and disaffiliation, yielding interpretable signatures of changing social conditions. Finally, sensitivity analyses map sharp regime boundaries in parameter space, indicating that modest shifts in recruitment efficacy or retention among active spreaders can qualitatively alter long-run religious landscapes.

This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian."}

This method is effective for anisotropic diffusion with mixed derivatives, where classical schemes often fail unless the covariance matrix is diagonally dominated.\n  A key feature of our framework is its robust treatment of boundary conditions, which avoids the accuracy loss commonly encountered in BZ and semi-Lagrangian schemes. For Dirichlet boundaries, we introduce (i) a quad-tree non-uniform stopping time scheme with O($Δt^{1/2}$) accuracy and (ii) a quad-tree uniform stopping time scheme with O($Δt$) accuracy. For Neumann boundaries, we use discrete specular reflection with O($Δt^{1/2}$) convergence, while periodic boundaries are treated using modular wrapping, achieving O($Δt$) accuracy.

The origin of the ergotropy produced, as well as the genesis of the battery capacity, can be readily traced back to the quantum coherences and population inversions generated (and the balance between these two mechanisms is contingent upon the starting Bloch polar angle). Importantly, the ergotropic charging power and its associated optimal charging time display notable deviations from standard results which disregard thermodynamic considerations.

Previous studies have shown that controlling the population of mosquitoes capable of transmitting the dengue virus can effectively reduce dengue infection rates. This study explores the use of Wolbachia as a strategy for dengue control by targeting mosquitoes. Since the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes involves substantial costs, careful planning is necessary to balance disease control with the associated economic burden. To address this, we propose a mathematical model that captures the dynamics of releasing Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and the transmission of dengue in a population. We formulate single- and multi-objective optimization frameworks to minimize the economic costs associated with releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and the hospitalization costs resulting from dengue infections.

Recently, strong interactions have been demonstrated to induce strain and dielectric screening tunable topological phases such as quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), trivial insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and metallic phase, in the ground state of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$. Moreover, charge dosing has been demonstrated to convert the QSHI into a dual QSHI state. Although the band structure of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ is central to interpreting its topological phases in transport experiments, direct experimental access to its intrinsic electronic structure has so far remained elusive. Here we report direct measurements of the monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ band structure using spatially resolved micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) with micrometre-scale resolution. The observed dispersions show quantitative agreement with density functional theory calculations using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional, establishing the insulating ground state and revealing no evidence for strong electronic correlations. We further uncover a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry in the doping response. Whereas hole doping is readily induced by electrostatic gating, attempts to introduce electrons via gating or alkali metal deposition do not yield a rigid upward shift of the Fermi level. Fractional charge calculations demonstrate that added electrons instead drive band renormalization and shrink the band gap. Taken together, our experimental and theoretical results identify the microscopic mechanism by which induced charges reshape the band topology of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$, showing that doping can fundamentally alter the electronic structure beyond the rigid band behaviour that is typically assumed."}

For processes of rumor propagation based on the Maki-Thompson model, we show how to construct exact constants of motion as linear combinations of conserved quantities in each elementary contact event, and how they relate to the constants of motion of the corresponding mean-field equations, which are obtained as the continuous-time, large-size limit of the stochastic process. For SIR epidemic models, both in homogeneous systems and on heterogeneous networks, we find that a similar procedure produces approximate constants of motion, whose average value is preserved along the evolution.

To address the difficulties induced by the extended noisy memory, by stochastic Fubini theorem, we transform the delay variational equation into a Volterra integral equation without delay, and then a kind of backward stochastic Volterra integral equation with Malliavin derivatives is introduced by the developed coefficient decomposition method and the generalized duality principle.

Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales.

Boundary normals and curvature are reconstructed by an adaptive local B-spline scheme that remains robust for strongly nonconvex shapes and large deformations. A posteriori error estimates are obtained from a hatmatrix formulation of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for both square collocation and zero-padded least-squares systems, and are complemented by maximum principle indicators for harmonic problems. Numerical experiments on circular, star-shaped, and amoeba-like domains show that square collocation suffices for moderately complex geometries, while zero-padded least-squares significantly improves interior velocity regularity and pointwise transport accuracy for strongly nonconvex shapes, without altering the source or collocation sets.

To solve this problem, we propose a scenario-sampling rolling-horizon framework that mitigates myopic bias by augmenting each planning epoch with sampled virtual tasks.

The problem addresses both demand and supply uncertainties by incorporating short-term leasing of modular facilities and dynamic relocation of resources. We formulate DSMMCP as a partially adaptive multi-stage stochastic program that minimizes the expected multi-period costs under uncertainty.

The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian."}

We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error. Numerical experiments on representative mean-field control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger."}

The proposed techniques focus on relaxing the traditional optimal step length associated with gradient methods, including the steepest descent (SD) and the minimal residual (MR) methods. Such a relaxation avoids the well-known negative zigzag effect and allows the iterates to move in the entire space which in turn implies that every so often the search direction approaches some eigenvector of the underlying Hessian matrix. The proposed speedups then rely on taking advantage of the properties of the Lanczos method once a search direction that approaches an eigenvector has been identified in order to accelerate the convergence towards the global minimizer. After analyzing the proposed strategies, we illustrate them on the global minimization of strictly convex functions."}

Under natural coercivity conditions on the cost functionals, we show that these growth conditions transfer to the value function and yield a viscosity characterization in the class of functions satisfying the same bounds. We further prove a comparison principle, which allows us to fully characterize the control problem through the associated HJB equation. Finally, we show that the problem simplifies in the mean-field regime, where the model coefficients exhibit symmetry with respect to the indices of the individuals in the population. This permutation invariance allows us to restrict attention to a reduced class of symmetric admissible controls, a reduction established by combining the viscosity characterization of the value function with measurable selection arguments."}

Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence."}

For two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, it is shown that both the NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in the presence of large and symmetric detuning between the qubits and the cavity. Moreover, the off-resonant interaction generates a high degree of NAQI and DIA from the initial product states of two qubits having the same detunings and unequal couplings to the cavity. Based on the effective coupling of the qubits induced by the cavity mode, we explain the physical mechanism underlying the validity of this strategy.

ML components offer high fidelity to training data and fast inference, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of complex multi-scale or multi-physics phenomena. Modern reservoir simulators rely on automatic differentiation (AD) to support efficient and flexible strategies for nonlinear solvers, inverse problems, and optimization problems. Efficient hybrid modeling therefore requires tight integration of the ML components with the simulator's AD framework.\n  We present the first integration of neural networks into the high-performance reservoir simulator OPM Flow. Networks are trained in TensorFlow and imported into OPM, where they are accessed as native AD functions. This presents an efficient framework for hybrid modeling and enables seamless integration in existing simulator workflows.\n  As an application, we introduce a novel, data-driven near-well model. Near-well models are essential in reservoir simulation for accurately representing singular pressure gradients around wells. Commonly used are the Peaceman near-well model and its extensions, or local grid refinement around the wells. Peaceman-type models are limited to simplified flow regimes, whereas local grid refinement is computationally expensive. We address these limitations by training a neural network to infer a Peaceman-like well index from fine-scale ensemble simulations of the near-well region. It is then integrated into OPM Flow with the new framework. Tested on relevant examples for CO$_2$ storage, the method offers high fidelity to fine-scale results at low computational cost, demonstrating the potential of the OPM Flow-Neural Network framework for hybrid modeling."}

We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$ and Huber losses. Moreover, we analyze the qualitative robustness of the In-CVaR based estimator under perturbation.

Indeed, dual-rail encoded erasure qubits in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high-fidelity operations by converting physical-qubit relaxation into logical-qubit erasures, but this comes at the cost of increased hardware overhead and circuit complexity. Here, we address these limitations by realizing erasure conversion in a single fluxonium operated at zero flux, where the logical state is encoded in its 0-2 subspace. A single, carefully engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line (EOL) logical measurement. Post-selection on non-erasure outcomes results in more than four-fold increase of the logical lifetime, from $193~μ$s to $869~μ$s. Finally, we characterize measurement-induced logical dephasing as a function of measurement power and frequency, and infer that each erasure check contributes a negligible error of $7.2\\times 10^{-5}$. These results establish integer-fluxonium as a promising, resource-efficient platform for erasure-based error mitigation, without requiring additional hardware."}

We first establish that if the limiting differential inclusion is input-to-state stable and the iterates remain almost surely bounded, then the iterates converge almost surely to the neighborhood of desired equilibrium. We then provide a verifiable sufficient condition for almost sure boundedness by assuming that the underlying operator is single-valued and globally Lipschitz.

The mathematical model is given by attenuated ray transforms of the fields along geodesic curves corresponding to a Riemannian metric that is defined by the index of refraction. The data are given at the boundary tangent bundle of the domain and it is well-known that they can be characterized as boundary data of a transport equation turning tensor field tomography into an inverse source problem. This way the adjoint of the forward mapping can be computed using the integral representation or, equivalently, associated to a dual transport equation. The article offers and proves two different representations for the adjoint mappings both in the dynamic and static case. The numerical implementation is demonstrated and evaluated for static fields using the damped Landweber method with Nesterov acceleration applied to both, the integral and PDE-based formulations. The transport equations are solved using a viscosity approximation. The error analysis reveals that the integral representation significantly outperforms PDE-based methods in terms of computational efficiency while achieving comparable reconstruction accuracy. The impact of noise and deviations from straight-line trajectories are investigated confirming improved accuracy if refraction is taken into account. We conclude that the inclusion of refraction to the forward model pays in spite of increased numerical cost."}

We exploit the analogy with one-dimensional quantum mechanics, and the well known correspondence between Bogoliubov coefficients in the QHO and transmission/reflection amplitudes in scattering theory. Within this framework, STA protocols for the QHO are equivalent to transmission resonances, while STA in QFT with homogeneous backgrounds correspond to reflectionless potentials. Moreover, using the connection between particle creation and squeezed states, we show how STA completions can be understood in terms of the anti-squeezing operator."}

Besides the fundamental $\\cosφ$ term, this relation can also contain higher Fourier harmonics $\\cos(kφ)$ corresponding to correlated tunneling of $k$ Cooper pairs. The parity of the dominant tunneling process, i.e.~whether an odd or even number of Cooper pairs tunnel, results in qualitatively different properties, and controlling this opens up a wide range of applications in superconducting technology. However, access to even-dominated regimes has remained challenging and has so far relied on complex multi-junction or all-hybrid architectures. Here, we demonstrate a simple \"harmonic parity qubit\" (HPQ); an element that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel to a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction forming a SQUID, and use spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct its energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points. At half flux quantum, the odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near $\\pmπ/2$. The ability to control harmonic parity enables supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and provides a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits."}

We establish that these operators extend the definition of the standard Laplacian and also preserve some of its properties. We present efficient algorithms using Krylov subspace methods for computing them, ensuring applicability of our proposed framework to large networks. Extensive numerical experiments on real-world networks validate the modeling flexibility of our approach and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms, including GPU acceleration."}

While prior studies predominantly treat dephasing noise as either Markovian or predominantly low-frequency, realistic qubit environments exhibit structured, frequency-dependent spectra. Here we demonstrate that noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting--set by the inter-qubit coupling strength g--induces a distinct relaxation channel that degrades gate performance. Through combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra, we show that two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with the noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, extending the concept of $T_{1ρ}$ relaxation to interacting systems. This frequency-selective relaxation mechanism, universal across platforms, enriches our understanding of decoherence pathways during gate operations. The same mechanism sets coherence limits for dual-rail or singlet-triplet encodings."}

Their topological stability makes them robust information carriers, ideal for tackling a key challenge in quantum computing: creating reliable, one-way links between different types of qubits. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce a novel device - the skyrmion quantum diode - based on skyrmion qubits. Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors"}

Contextuality of the input state in MBQC has been identified as a key resource for quantum advantage, and in a stronger form, underlies algebraic relations between (measurement) operators which obey classically unsatisfiable (linear) constraints. Here, we compare these two perspectives on contextuality, and study to what extent they are related. More precisely, we associate a LCS to certain MBQC which exhibit strong forms of state-dependent contextuality, and ask if the measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to state-independent contextuality in the form of quantum solutions of its associated LCS. Our main result rules out such quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC. This both sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and further generalises results on the non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimension."}

A key contributor to these failures is biological uncertainty, which complicates trial design and weakens the ability to detect true treatment effects. In particular, inadequate patient stratification often results in covariate imbalances across treatment arms, masking treatment effects and reducing statistical power, even when therapies are effective for specific patient subpopulations. This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints. Using real clinical trial data, we demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods achieve high-quality stratification while scaling efficiently to larger cohorts. In our benchmark study, the quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over a 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale. This report shows how improved stratification can lead to decision-relevant gains, including up to a fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity. Together, these results show that optimization-driven stratification can strengthen clinical trial design, improve confidence in downstream decisions, and reduce the risk of costly late-stage failure."}

The algorithm, called matching decomposition, works by decomposing a continuous-time quantum walk Hamiltonian into a collection of exactly implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to matchings in the underlying graph followed by a novel graph compression algorithm that merges edges in the graph. Lastly, we convert the walks to a circuit and Trotterize over these components. The dynamics of the walker on each edge in the matching can be implemented in the circuit model as sequences of CX and CRx gates. We do not use Pauli decomposition when implementing walks along each matching. Furthermore, we compare matching decomposition to a standard Pauli-based simulation pipeline and find that matching decomposition consistently yields substantial resource reductions, requiring up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits than Pauli decomposition across multiple graph families. Finally, we also present examples and theoretical results for when matching decomposition can exactly simulate a continuous-time quantum walk on a graph."}

This work presents a detailed benchmarking and robustness investigation of classical classifiers under class imbalance mitigation using the Quantum Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (QSMOTE) and quantum-inspired perturbations modelled using six noise channels. Four different datasets, the Solar Panel Image Dataset (SPID), the CWRU Bearing Dataset (CWRUBD), the Engine Failure Detection Dataset (EFDD), and the Industrial Fault Detection Dataset (IFDD), are tested across multi-class scenarios to determine the universality of these impacts. The results show that QSMOTE consistently corrects distributional skew and significantly enhances the performance of non-linear classifiers such as Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees (DT), yielding improvements of up to 170% on EFDD and achieving near-perfect accuracy ($\\geq$0.99) on IFDD. Linear and probabilistic models, such as Linear Regression (LR) and Naive Bayes (NB), produce mixed results, with significant degradation in overlapping feature spaces due to interpolation-induced boundary distortion. A parallel robustness analysis under different noise models reveals that ensemble models (RF) and margin-based learners (SVM) maintain strong resilience, often preserving over 95% of baseline accuracy even under maximum noise. In contrast, NB and DT show substantial instability, especially on high-variance datasets. The findings establish a rigorous baseline for understanding how classical models behave under realistic imbalance and quantum-inspired noise."}

Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a driven quantum resonator whose temperature is controlled by modulating its natural frequency. We evaluate the work performed by the external drive and the resulting heat flow between the resonator and its environment, both within linear response and beyond.

They are compared to those of a special case of the Rosenzweig-Porter model with random matrices composed of two diagonal blocks modeling the spectral properties of the QBs, that are coupled with a tunable parameter. We demonstrate that this model is suitable for the description of the experimental data and thus may be employed to determine the strength of the coupling. It results from the increasing overlap of eigenmodes in the QBs penetrating through the opening into the other one, leading to a mixing of their eigenstates, and the breaking of the symmetry present in the QB with integrable dynamics. This implicates deviations of the spectral properties from those of typical quantum systems with integrable and chaotic dynamics, respectively, and approaches those of a fully chaotic system for sufficiently large coupling strength. In contrast in previous studies the transition from integrable to chaotic dynamics was induced by introducing a random potential of increasing strength into such a QB and applicability of a variant of the Rosenzweig-Porter model was tested."}
