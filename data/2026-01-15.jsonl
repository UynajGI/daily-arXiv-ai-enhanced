Here, we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and frustrated magnetic properties of FeGe$_3$O$_4$, a newly identified compound that crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric cubic space group $P2_13$. In this structure, Fe atoms form an intricate double-trillium lattice with nearest-neighbor Fe--Fe distances of $\\sim$4.2~Å, while Ge$^{2+}$ ions mediate magnetic interactions through Fe-Ge-Fe pathways. Field-dependent magnetization at 2~K shows a pronounced nonlinearity, reaching a maximum moment of 2.55(3)~$μ_\\mathrm{B}$/Fe$^{2+}$ at 70~kOe without evidence of saturation. Magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering collectively reveal the onset of short-range magnetic interactions near 5~K, with no long-range ordering detected down to 0.06~K. Specific heat measurements demonstrate strong frustration: only $\\sim$34\\% of the expected magnetic entropy is recovered at 2.4~K. Taken together, these results establish FeGe$_3$O$_4$ as a rare example of a geometrically frustrated trillium-lattice magnet, offering a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum magnetic phenomena."}

On the exclusive side, we perform BCL parameterizations of the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar form factors and compare the fitted coefficients with those from earlier results by HPQCD. We also perform a HQET-based parameterization of the P-wave form factors to shed new light on the 1/2-vs-3/2 puzzle.

The task is challenging because, not only may there be arbitrarily different and complex relationships between predictor variables and each label, but associations among labels may exist even after accounting for effects of predictor variables. In this paper, we present a Bayesian additive regression tree (BART) framework to model the problem. BART is a nonparametric and flexible model structure capable of uncovering complex relationships within the data. Our adaptation, MLCBART, assumes that labels arise from thresholding an underlying numeric scale, where a multivariate normal model allows explicit estimation of the correlation structure among labels. This enables the discovery of complicated relationships in various forms and improves MLC predictive performance. Our Bayesian framework not only enables uncertainty quantification for each predicted label, but our MCMC draws produce an estimated conditional probability distribution of label combinations for any predictor values. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by comparing its performance with a set of models, including the oracle model with the correct functional form. Results show that our model predicts vectors of labels more accurately than other contenders and its performance is close to the oracle model. An example highlights how the method's ability to produce measures of uncertainty on predictions provides nuanced understanding of classification results."}

PI-OHAM, based on classical HAM, employs a physics-informed residual loss to optimize convergence-control parameters systematically by combining data, boundary conditions, and governing equations in the manner similar to Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The combination of the flexibility of PINNs and the analytical transparency of HAM provides the approach with high numerical stability, rapid convergence, and high consistency with traditional numerical solutions. PI-OHAM has superior accuracy-time trade-offs and faster and more accurate convergence than standard HAM and PINNs when applied to the Blasius boundary-layer problem. It is also very close to numerical standards available in the literature. PI-OHAM ensures analytical transparency and interpretability by series-based solutions, unlike purely data-driven or data-free PINNs. Significant contributions are a conceptual bridge between decades of homotopy-based analysis and modern physics-inspired methods, and a numerically aided but analytically interpretable solver of nonlinear differential equations. PI-OHAM appears as a computationally efficient, accurate and understandable alternative to nonlinear fluid flow, heat transfer and other industrial problems in cases where robustness and interpretability are important."}

Such records can be obtained from studies of turbidites triggered by seismic activity in marine and lake basins. The Sea of Marmara (SoM), located on the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), serves as an important laboratory for subaqueous palaeoseismological research. This is because it has 2500 yrs. of historical earthquake records that can be correlated with radiometrically dated sedimentary earthquake records. Additionally, the relatively high sedimentation rate ($\\sim$3 mm/yr) in the deep subbasins allows the recognition of individual events. Following the destructive 1912 Mw 7.4 Şarköy-Mürefte and 1999 Mw 7.4 Izmit and Mw 7.2 Düzce earthquakes, the main submerged part of the NAF in the SoM represents a seismic gap, where the long-term earthquake history is of crucial importance for earthquake risk assessment. We have studied nine cores recovered along the most active northern strand of the NAF (i.e. the Main Marmara Fault: MMF), using high resolution digital X-ray radiography, $μ$-XRF core scanning, MSCL physical properties and grain-size analyses. The chronology was determined using accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon and radionuclide methods. In the cores, coseismic turbidites commonly consist of a basal part with multiple sand-silt laminae above a sharp and often erosional base and an overlying graded mud part (homogenite). The basal parts exhibit high gamma density and MS, and are often enriched in one or more elements, such as Si, K, Fe, Ti, Zr, Ca and Sr, indicative of coarse siliciclastic and carbonate shell fragments. Radionuclide- and radiocarbon-dated coseismic turbidites in different SoM subbasins extending back to more than 5000 yrs. indicate an average earthquake recurrence time between 220 and 300 yrs. along the different segments of the MMF. These results are compatible with the GPS velocities and geological slip rates. However, the intervals between two consecutive events vary widely between 50 and 695 yrs. for the different northern NAF segments. Integration of our results with previous studies indicates that the M > 7 events recorded are the 1999, 1509, 1296 and 740 earthquakes on the __zmit Gulf segment; the 1894, 1509, 1343, 1090 and 740 earthquakes on the Prince Islands segment in the Çınarcık Basin; the 1894, 1766, 1509, 989, 869 or 862, 740 and 447 earthquakes on the Central High segment and in the Central Basin; and the 1912, 1766, 1344, 989 and 447 earthquakes on the western Marmara segment. The 1912 Şarköy-Mürefte earthquake record is absent in the Central Basin, which suggests that the earthquake rupture did not extend beyond the western end of the Western High. The distribution of the 2500 yr-long sedimentary earthquake records matched with the historical earthquakes along the MMF indicates the common occurrence of multiple-segment ruptures, and suggests that presently, the most earthquake-prone part of the MMF is the Central High segment, located SW of Istanbul."}

Likelihood-based estimators typically lead to non-convex and possibly multimodal optimization landscapes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may mix exponentially slowly. We propose a class of computationally tractable estimators--plug-in and PDE-penalized M-estimators--for inverse problems defined through operator equations of the form $L_f u = g$, where $f$ is the unknown parameter and $u$ is the observed solution. The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \\nabla\\!\\cdot(f\\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schrödinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems. Our estimators also provide principled warm-start initializations for polynomial-time Bayesian computation."}

Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning.

Stability is proven under specific conditions on the SAT parameters, scaled with the spatial mesh resolution and material properties. We compute design sensitivities using a discrete space-time adjoint scheme that is dual-consistent with the primal SBP-SAT scheme. Dual consistency ensures that the discrete adjoint consistently approximates the continuous dual problem and, under standard smoothness assumptions, yields superconvergent functional estimates. We validate the resulting optimal designs by comparison with an independently computed reference optimal design and report time-to-solution and cost-of-accuracy curves, comparing against low-order time-marching and all-at-once solvers for the forward and adjoint systems. The proposed scheme attains high accuracy with fewer space-time degrees of freedom and remains stable, reducing time-to-solution and memory compared with an alternative all-at-once solver.

It focuses on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) schemes and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Specifically, it introduces a new proximal ADMM algorithm and proposes two BCD methods. The first part of the research presents a new proximal ADMM algorithm. This method is adaptive to all problem parameters and solves the proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) subproblem inexactly. This adaptiveness facilitates the highly efficient application of the algorithm to a broad swath of practical problems. The inexact solution of the proximal AL subproblem overcomes many key challenges in the practical applications of ADMM. The resultant algorithm obtains an approximate solution of an optimization problem in a number of iterations that matches the state-of-the-art complexity for the class of proximal ADMM schemes. The second part of the research focuses on an inexact proximal mapping for the class of block proximal gradient methods. Key properties of this operator is established, facilitating the derivation of convergence rates for the proposed algorithm. Under two error decreases conditions, the algorithm matches the convergence rate of its exactly computed counterpart. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm under a dynamic error regime over a fixed one. The dissertation concludes by providing convergence guarantees for the randomized BCD method applied to a broad class of functions, known as Hölder smooth functions. Convergence rates are derived for non-convex, convex, and strongly convex functions. These convergence rates match those furnished in the existing literature for the Lipschtiz smooth setting."}

However, the prevailing industry model, where corporations retain ownership of the VTuber persona while the Nakanohito bears the immense pressure of dual-identity management, exposes the Nakanohito to significant vulnerabilities, including burnout, harassment, and precarious labor conditions. When these pressures become untenable, the Nakanohito may terminate their contracts and later debut with a new persona, a process known as \"reincarnation\". This phenomenon, a rising concern in the industry, inflicts substantial losses on the Nakanohito, agencies, and audiences alike. Understanding the quantitative fallout of reincarnation is crucial for mitigating this damage and fostering a more sustainable industry. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of VTuber reincarnation, analyzing 12 significant cases using a comprehensive dataset of 728K livestream sessions and 4.5B viewer interaction records. Our results suggest reincarnation significantly damages a Nakanohito's career, leading to a decline in audience and financial support, an increase in harassment, and negative repercussions for the wider VTuber industry.

Consequently, the variance of the plane-averaged potential grows linearly with depth in semi-infinite slabs and follows a parabolic Brownian-bridge profile in finite cells with both ends fixed, with an amplitude inversely proportional to the cell's lateral area.

The study of the signal produced by a real memristor nano-device focused on the description in terms of the Landau φ4 theory for the critical phenomena in finite systems. This further allowed the utilization of the property of the anomalous enhancement of the autocorrelation function when a system is on the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), for improving the quantity of the demonstrated memory, while simultaneously maintaining a very good quality, as this is expressed by the stability of the autocorrelation function. In this proof-of-concept case, the morphology of the signal allowed us to impose the appropriate modifications on the signal so that we finally show how to get very close to the characteristics of the SSB and thus achieve our goal to get as close as possible to the ideal behavior of a Memristor that yields deep memory. Finally, we provide proof of the stability of memristor's operation by showing that solitons \"follow\" as a skeleton structure the experimentally derived time series."}

Current wavefront shaping technologies face a fundamental dichotomy: spatial light modulators (SLMs) offer high pixel count but suffer from low refresh rates, while acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) provide moderate speed with restricted optical beam geometries. Though recent advances in photonic integrated circuits achieve fast switching, there is currently no tool that provides MHz-rate, continuous motion, and arbitrarily reconfigurable control over a set of diffraction-limited spots. Here we introduce a new class of spatial light modulator that provides both 2D pixel geometry and high speed. The device operates by encoding spatial information in frequency bins via a broadband optical phase modulator, and decoding them via a first-of-its-kind, high-resolution 2D spectrometer. The spectrometer, based on the architecture which we call the Re-Imaging Phased Array (RIPA), achieves its sensitivity through long path-lengths, enabled by intra-spectrometer re-imaging lens-guides. We demonstrate site-resolved optical pulsing with a 44(1)~ns rise time, corresponding to frame rates exceeding 10 million frames per second, as well as arbitrary, reconfigurable 2D addressing and multi-site operations, including asynchronous, independent beam motion, splitting, and recombination. Leveraging these tools opens new horizons in rapid optical manipulation of matter across science, from fast, scalable control that approaches the inertial and radiation limits of atoms in quantum processors, to dynamically programmable, microsecond-resolved illumination in microscopy and neuro-biological imaging."}

They admit closed-form expressions for densities and many functionals of interest, making them attractive for practical applications. However, the complex conditions on the dependence parameters to ensure that Sarmanov copulas are valid limit their application in high dimensions. Verifying the $d$-increasing property typically requires satisfying a combinatorial set of inequalities that makes direct construction difficult. To circumvent this issue, we develop a stochastic representation for bivariate Sarmanov copulas. We prove that every admissible Sarmanov can be realized as a mixture of independent univariate distributions indexed by a latent Bernoulli pair. The stochastic representation replaces the problem of verifying copula validity with the problem of ensuring nonnegativity of a Bernoulli probability mass function. The representation also recovers classical copula families, including Farlie--Gumbel--Morgenstern, Huang--Kotz, and Bairamov--Kotz--Bekçi as special cases. We further derive sharp global bounds for Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. We then introduce a Bernoulli-mixing construction in higher dimensions, leading to a new class of multivariate Sarmanov copulas with easily verifiable parameter constraints and scalable simulation algorithms. Finally, we show that powered versions of bivariate Sarmanov copulas admit a similar stochastic representation through block-maximal order statistics."}

To overcome this issue, we apply the concept of the J-method [E.~Jarlebring, S.~Kvaal, W.~Michiels.

This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions. Existing solutions commonly generate these incomplete attributes, which may introduce additional biases and further compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Beyond streamlining existing derivations and establishing their consistency, we leverage the complementary nature of the two methods to obtain new exact analytical results. Specifically, we derive an explicit large deviation function for the first-passage time distribution in the subcritical regime and closed-form expressions for the conditional mean first-passage time for arbitrary offset. Despite its simplicity, this first crossing process exhibits non-trivial critical behavior and provides a rare example where all the main results of interest can be derived exactly."}

By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy.

Motivated by recent experimental observations of broken helix magnetic structures in EuIn$_2$As$_2$, we focus on the microscopic interaction conditions in stabilizing such multiple-$Q$ states.We employ two effective spin models: One is the momentum-space-based model, and the other is the real-space-based model, both of which include bilinear and biquadratic easy-plane anisotropic interactions. By analyzing their ground state via simulated annealing, we find that a superposition of a spiral and a staggered modulation yields a robust double-$Q$ magnetic structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the obtained double-$Q$ spin configuration exhibits an antisymmetric spin-split band structure even without the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and further reveals asymmetric band modulations when the magnetic field is applied along the out-of-plane direction.

However, practical recommendations for selecting the tempering parameter and statistical guarantees for the resulting power posterior remain open questions. Cross-validation-based approaches to tuning this parameter suggest interesting asymptotic regimes for the selected $α$, which can either vanish or behave like a mixture distribution with a point mass at infinity and the remaining mass converging to zero. We formalize the asymptotic properties of the power posterior in these regimes. In particular, we provide sufficient conditions for (i) consistency of the power posterior moments and (ii) asymptotic normality of the power posterior mean. Our analysis required us to establish a new Laplace approximation that is interesting in its own right and is the key technical tool for showing a critical threshold $α\\asymp 1/\\sqrt{n}$ where the asymptotic normality of the posterior mean breaks.

UTP is inspired by the Mapped Tent Pitching (MTP) algorithm [Gopalakrishnan, Sch{ö}berl, Wintersteiger, 2017], which constructs the solution by iteratively building polytopal space--time subdomains, referred to as tents. In MTP, each physical tent is mapped onto a space--time rectangle, where local problems are solved before being mapped back to the original domain. In contrast, UTP avoids the nonlinear and potentially singular mapping step by computing the solution directly on a physical space--time rectangle that contains the tent, at the expense of redundant computations in the region outside the tent. In this work, we investigate several strategies to extend UTP to heterogeneous media, where the wave propagation speed is piecewise constant over two subregions of the domain.

Using a duality approach, we establish an augmented observability inequality for the adjoint system and show its equivalence to controllability. In the finite-dimensional setting, this leads to sharp necessary and sufficient algebraic rank conditions extending the classical Kalman criterion to systems with memory and delay."}

Using simulated annealing as a hardware-noise-free testbed, we systematically compare the penalty-spin (PS) model, which couples replicas through a centralized auxiliary layer, with the stacked model, which couples adjacent replicas directly. Numerical experiments on the quadratic assignment problem reveal that the ferromagnetically coupled stacked model stably maintains constraint satisfaction and improves solution quality over a broad parameter range, exhibiting favorable scalability with both the number of replicas and problem size. In contrast, the PS model suffers from cooperation collapse at large parallelism: many-replica averaging in the PS layer washes out sparse solution information, preventing effective inter-replica coordination. These findings demonstrate that the topology of inter-replica couplings decisively influences search robustness, and provide practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning in constrained optimization."}

Existing methods like purification and minimally entangled typical thermal states offer partial solutions but struggle with scalability and accuracy in low-temperature regime. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach based on generating-function matrix product states (GFMPS). By directly computing a large set of Bloch-type excited states, we construct Gibbs states that moderate the area-law constraint, enabling accurate and efficient approximation of low-temperature thermal behavior. Our benchmark results show magnificent agreement with both exact diagonalization and experimental observations, validating the accuracy of our approach. This method offers a promising new direction for overcoming the longstanding challenges of studying low-temperature properties within the tensor network framework. We also expect that our method will facilitate the numerical simulation of quantum materials in comparison with experimental observations."}

Here, we address this through graph sparsification with auxiliary copy variables and demonstrate a fully on-chip parallel tempering solver on an FPGA. Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning. These results establish an on-chip p-bit architecture and a scalable algorithmic framework for dense combinatorial optimization."}

Fisher's result has generated extensive controversy in biology. I show that the theorem is a simple example of a general partition for change in regression predictions across altered contexts. By that rule, the total change in a mean response is the sum of two terms. The first ascribes change to the difference in predictor variables, holding constant the regression coefficients. The second ascribes change to altered context, captured by shifts in the regression coefficients. This general result follows immediately from the product rule for finite differences applied to a regression equation. Economics widely applies this same partition, the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, as a fundamental tool that can in proper situations be used for causal analysis. Recognizing the underlying mathematical generality clarifies Fisher's theorem, provides a useful tool for causal analysis, and reveals connections across disciplines."}

This connection is conceptually appealing and illustrates that the superposition theorem deserves wider recognition in Statistics -- not only because of its link to regular means as shown here, but also due to its influence on the development of neural models and its potential connections with other statistical frameworks. In addition, we establish a stability property of regular means, showing that they vary smoothly under small perturbations of the generator. Finally, we provide insights into a recent universal central limit theorem that applies to the broad class of regular means."}

Deviations from $ρ_{\\rm FL}=ρ_0+AT^2$ in bad and strange metals are commonly ascribed to a breakdown of Landau's quasiparticle (QP) concept. Yet, it remains unclear what mechanism drives the temperature dependence of $ρ(T)$ beyond $ρ_{\\rm FL}$. Here, we examine the bad metal upon approaching the Mott metal-insulator transition via chemical pressure in $κ$-[(BEDT-STF)$_x$(BEDT-TTF)$_{1-x}$]$\\rm _2 Cu_2 (CN)_3$. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transport experiments on the same single crystals, we directly link the onset of deviations from Korringa law $(T_1T)^{-1} = \\mathrm{const.}$ with the rise of $ρ(T)$ beyond $ρ_{\\rm FL}$. From the NMR relaxation rate, we can identify the gradual crossover between the QP-dominated regime at low $T$ to predominant local moments at higher $T$. By comparing our experimental findings with dynamical mean-field theory calculations, which accurately reproduce the transport data, we reveal how this crossover is reflected in $T$-dependent changes of the QP spectrum. Near the Mott insulator, where $dρ/dT<0$ at high $T$, an Einstein-relation analysis shows that bad-metal behavior with $dρ/dT>0$ is driven by the temperature dependence of the electronic compressibility rather than the diffusion constant."}

Neither quantum theory nor any theory for ideal measurements allows for ENS boxes. That is, according to quantum theory, ENS boxes are nonphysical. Still, ENS boxes are crucial for addressing a number of problems in Bell nonlocality. Here, we obtain ENS boxes in arbitrary bipartite Bell scenarios and present the complete list of ENS boxes for several unexplored scenarios. Equipped with the boxes, we revisit several foundational questions. We find that already two copies of any ENS box violate the exclusivity (or local orthogonality) and Specker's principles. We provide the minimal decomposition of the magic square correlation - the simplest known perfect correlation in nature - in terms of ENS boxes. We identify the minimal scenario in which a dit of communication (with d < 6) is insufficient to simulate ENS boxes. Our results show that the ENS boxes approach leads to new results and opens new avenues for research."}

By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy. We introduce a submatrix-based framework for analyzing local observables in the energy eigenbasis. By extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal of the local observables represented in eigenbasis, we show that these submatrices exhibit both the short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian.

Motivated by these findings, we propose a unified generalized odds (GO) framework that represents subject-specific distributions through ratios of probabilities over arbitrary regions of the sample space, subsuming hazard, survival, and residual life representations as special cases. We develop a scale-on-odds regression model using spline-based functional representations with penalization for efficient estimation. Applied to wrist-worn accelerometry data from the HEAL-MS study, generalized odds models yield improved prediction of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores compared to classical scalar and survival-based approaches, demonstrating the value of odds-based distributional covariates for modeling DHT data."}

The controlled dynamics are of McKean-Vlasov type and are subject to regime switching driven by a hidden Markov chain. The observation process depends on the control and on the joint distribution of the state and control, which prevents the direct application of standard filtering techniques. The main contribution of this paper is to show how this distribution dependence can be handled within a change-of-probability framework, leading to a well-posed separated control problem. We derive a Zakai equation with a specific structure for the unnormalized filter, and show that the corresponding value function satisfies a dynamic programming principle. This yields a Bellman equation posed on a convex subset of a Wasserstein space, characterizing the optimal control problem under partial observation."}

The integration of these color center ensembles into a planar silicon carbide waveguide enables efficient excitation of a large ensemble and simplifies fluorescence extraction compared to standard confocal methods. We report continuous-wave (CW) optically detected magnetic resonance measurements, complemented by Rabi, Ramsey, and Hahn-echo sequences, which demonstrate coherent capabilities of the large embedded ensemble of V2 centers. Based on the data, our device exhibits sensor shot-noise limited sensitivities 2-3 orders of magnitude lower compared to more complex confocal techniques.

Most existing methods are based on the assumption that different layers are either independent or follow specific dependence structures, and edges within the same layer are independent. In this article, we propose a novel method for community detection in multilayer networks that accounts for a broad range of inter-layer and intra-layer dependence structures. The proposed method integrates the multilayer stochastic block model for community detection with a multivariate probit model to capture the structures of inter-layer dependence, which also allows intra-layer dependence. To facilitate parameter estimation, we develop a constrained pairwise likelihood method coupled with an efficient alternating updating algorithm. The asymptotic properties of the proposed method are also established, with a focus on examining the influence of inter-layer and intra-layer dependences on the accuracy of both parameter estimation and community detection. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments on both simulated networks and a real-world multilayer trade network."}

The core of our approach is the design of a canonical internal model that directly converts the disturbance rejection problem into an adaptive stabilization problem for an augmented system. Unlike conventional methods, this internal model is synthesized directly from the given nonlinear plant and the knowledge of the exosystem, without relying on the solution of the regulator equations. This makes the approach applicable to a significantly broader class of nonautonomous nonlinear systems. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive disturbance observer comprising the canonical nonlinear internal model, a Luenberger-type state observer, and a parameter adaptation law. This observer ensures global asymptotic convergence of the disturbance estimate to the true disturbance without requiring persistent excitation (PE). Under the PE condition, both the disturbance estimation error and the parameter estimation error converge exponentially. By incorporating the disturbance estimate as a feedforward compensation signal, we establish sufficient conditions for achieving global trajectory tracking and asymptotic disturbance rejection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical simulation of a flexible-joint robotic manipulator."}

A central open problem is whether an obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits exists. Despite several efforts having been made toward this goal, prior works have succeeded only in obfuscating quantum circuits that implement either pseudo-deterministic functions or unitary transformations. Although unitary transformations already include a broad class of quantum computation, many important quantum tasks, such as state preparation and quantum error-correction, go beyond unitaries and fall within general completely positive trace-preserving maps.\n  In this work, we construct the first quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits that support quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model assuming post-quantum one-way functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed in Bartusek et al. (STOC 2023), Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024), and Huang and Tang (FOCS 2025). At the core of our construction lies a novel primitive that we introduce, called the subspace-preserving strong pseudorandom unitary (spsPRU). An spsPRU is a family of efficient unitaries that fix every vector in a given linear subspace $S$, while acting as a Haar random unitary on the orthogonal complement $S^\\perp$ under both forward and inverse oracle queries. Furthermore, by instantiating the classical oracle model with the ideal obfuscation scheme for classical circuits proposed by Jain et al. (CRYPTO 2023) and later enhanced by Bartusek et al. (arxiv:2510.05316), our obfuscation scheme can also be realized in the quantumly accessible pseudorandom oracle model."}

These resources can help to start conversations between the trial team and patients and other stakeholders about the best choice of estimand and intercurrent event strategies for a randomised trial."}

Many industrial geometries feature repeating subdomains or contain sub-regions governed by distinct physical phenomena, making them well-suited to Domain Decomposition (DD) techniques. The integration of ROM and DD is promising to further reduce computational costs by constructing local ROMs and assembling them into global solutions. Due to the complexity and necessity of coupling ROMs, many approaches have been proposed in recent years. This review provides a concise overview of existing methodologies combining ROM and DD. We categorize existing methods into intrusive (projection-based) and non-intrusive (data-driven) frameworks. Various strategies for generating local reduced bases and coupling them across subdomains are illustrated. Particular emphasis is placed on intrusive techniques, including equations, numerical algorithms, and practical implementations. The non-intrusive framework is also discussed, highlighting its general procedures, basic formulations, and underlying principles. Finally, we summarise the state of the literature, identify open challenges, and present perspectives on future implementation from an engineering viewpoint."}

Likelihood-based estimators typically lead to non-convex and possibly multimodal optimization landscapes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may mix exponentially slowly. We propose a class of computationally tractable estimators--plug-in and PDE-penalized M-estimators--for inverse problems defined through operator equations of the form $L_f u = g$, where $f$ is the unknown parameter and $u$ is the observed solution. The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \\nabla\\!\\cdot(f\\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schrödinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems.

However, the fundamental mechanistic principles that govern their dynamics and relaxation remain elusive. In this work, we provide the microscopic mechanistic understanding of the exciton-polariton relaxation process that follows from an excitation in the upper polariton. Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fröhlich scattering is significantly suppressed. We show that the microscopic origin of this suppression is phonon-fluctuations synchronization (or self-averaging) due to the polaritonic spatial delocalization in the quantization direction. Finally, we show that the same phonon fluctuation-synchronization effect plays a central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, and we derive simple analytical expressions that relate a material's finite thickness to the corresponding relaxation rate constants."}

Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \\ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data.\n  In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings.

A new type of Clauser-Horne inequality for statistical cumulants and central moments is formulated.

We first revisit the one-body problem on the half line in the presence of an inverse-square potential -- the simplest example of nontrivial scale-invariant quantum mechanics -- and show that continuous scale invariance can be broken to discrete phase invariance in a small window of coupling constant. We also show that discrete phase invariance manifests itself as circularly distributed simple poles on Riemann sheets of the S-matrix. We then present three examples of few-body problems that exhibit discrete phase invariance. These examples are the one-body Aharonov-Bohm problem, a two-body problem of nonidentical particles in two dimensions, and a three-body problem of nonidentical particles in one dimension, all of which contain a codimension-two ``magnetic'' flux in configuration spaces."}

Using numerical simulations, we analyze representative GHPS states and show that the GHPS spherical coordinates govern the amplitude ratio and relative phase between the pole bases. This framework enables spatially inhomogeneous polarization distributions and intensity patterns, including nonseparable structures in which polarization and intensity are intrinsically intertwined, and provides a systematic state-space description for the coherent geometrical control of advanced structured light fields."}

A key obstacle to its broader use is that existing convergence guarantees typically rely on analytical conditions that are either overly restrictive or difficult to verify for concrete problems. We address this issue by introducing an a posteriori certification viewpoint: instead of requiring fully a priori verifiable assumptions, we provide convergence and error guarantees that can be validated directly from the iterates produced by the algorithm. Specifically, we prove a generalized global convergence theorem showing that, under convexity and a substantially weaker numerically verifiable condition, the QAB iteration converges to the global minimizer. This theorem yields a practical certification procedure: by checking explicit inequalities along the computed trajectory, one can certify global optimality and bound the suboptimality of the obtained value. As an application, we develop a certified iterative scheme for computing the quantum relative entropy of channels, a fundamental measure of distinguishability in quantum dynamics. This quantity is notoriously challenging to evaluate numerically: gradient-based methods are impeded by the complexity of matrix functions such as square roots and logarithms, while recent semidefinite programming approaches can become computationally and memory intensive at high precision. Our method avoids these bottlenecks by combining the QAB iteration with a posteriori certification, yielding an efficient and scalable algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate rapid convergence and improved scalability and adaptivity compared with SDP-based approaches."}

In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum computation (NBQC) to efficiently realize distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation using many small-scale nodes. A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes."}

Of particular interest to areas such as quantum simulation and linear-system solvers are sparse quantum states, which contain only a small number $s$ of non-zero computational basis states compared to a generic state. In this work, we present an approach that prepares $s$-sparse states on $n$ qubits, reducing the number of Toffoli gates required compared to prior art. We work in the established framework of first preparing a dense state on a $\\lceil{\\log(s)}\\rceil$-qubit sub-register, and then mapping this state to the target state via an isometry, with the latter step dominating the cost of the full algorithm. The speed-up is achieved by designing an efficient algorithm for finding and implementing the isometry. The worst-case Toffoli cost of our isometry circuit, which may be viewed as a batched version of an approach by Malvetti et al., is essentially $2s$ for sufficiently large values of $n$, yielding roughly a $\\log(s)/2$ improvement factor over the state-of-the-art. In numerical benchmarks on randomly chosen states, the cost is closer to $s$. With the improved isometry circuit, we examine the dense-state preparation step and present ways to optimize the joint cost of both steps, particularly in the case of target states with purely real coefficients, by outsourcing some sub-tasks from the dense-state preparation to the isometry."}

For the unapodized configuration, we observe a monotonic increase in spectral purity with gain, whereas the apodized configuration exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence, initially decreasing and then recovering at higher gain. By combining Schmidt-mode analysis with a group-velocity-based interpretation, we explain why different dispersion conditions exhibit distinct gain-dependent behavior, specifically that rapid purification occurs when the pump group velocity lies between those of the signal and idler. Our study shows that the evolution of spectral purity is governed primarily by the underlying dispersion of the waveguide.

This is done by removing the contribution of the orthogonal states. By explicitly constructing the Liouvillian superoperator in the full $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space, we compute the steady-state density matrix, the Liouvillian spectral gap, entanglement witness and the fidelity with respect to the ideal cluster state. The results demonstrate that the cluster state emerges as the steady state when the engineered Liouvillian dissipation dominates over the local Ising interaction between spins.
