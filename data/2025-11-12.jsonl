The method combines neural networks with reduced-order modeling and physics-informed training to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. In the offline stage, reduced basis functions are obtained via nonlinear dimension reduction, and a neural surrogate is trained to map parameters to approximate solutions. The surrogate employs a nonlinear reconstruction of the solution from the basis functions, enabling more accurate representation of complex solution structures than linear mappings. The model is further refined during the online stage using lightweight physics-informed neural network training. This offline-online framework enables accurate prediction especially in complex scenarios or with limited snapshot data. We demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments."}

A range of approaches have been explored, with graph-based models standing out for their ability to capture structural patterns in transaction networks. However, these approaches face two main challenges: label noise and label scarcity, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalization. To address these, we propose HiLoMix, a graph-based learning framework specifically designed for mixing address association. First, we construct the Heterogeneous Attributed Mixing Interaction Graph (HAMIG) to enrich the topological structure. Second, we introduce frequency-aware graph contrastive learning that captures complementary structural signals from high- and low-frequency graph views. Third, we employ weak supervised learning that assigns confidence-based weighting to noisy labels. Then, we jointly train high-pass and low-pass GNNs using both unsupervised contrastive signals and confidence-based supervision to learn robust node representations. Finally, we adopt a stacking framework to fuse predictions from multiple heterogeneous models, further improving generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that HiLoMix outperforms existing methods in mixing address association."}

Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that CometNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on extended forecast horizons."}

While the rise of large-language models offer new possible opportunities for measuring expressions of human values (e.g., humility or equality) in social media data, there remain both conceptual and practical challenges in operationalizing value expression in social media posts: what value system and operationalization is most applicable, and how do we actually measure them? In this paper, we draw on the Schwartz value system as a broadly encompassing and theoretically grounded set of basic human values, and introduce a framework for measuring Schwartz value expressions in social media posts at scale. We collect 32,370 ground truth value expression annotations from N=1,079 people on 5,211 social media posts representative of real users' feeds. We observe low levels of inter-rater agreement between people, and low agreement between human raters and LLM-based methods. Drawing on theories of interpretivism - that different people will have different subjective experiences of the same situation - we argue that value expression is (partially) in the eye of the beholder. In response, we construct a personalization architecture for classifying value expressions. We find that a system that explicitly models these differences yields predicted value expressions that people agree with more than they agree with other people. These results contribute new methods and understanding for the measurement of human values in social media data."}

Correlated electronic orders, such as charge-density waves and superconductivity, are observed to intertwine with subtle time-reversal symmetry breaking whose microscopic origin is not currently understood. Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint. Our results establish rare-earth local moment spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of subtle broken symmetries and highlight an unexpected interplay between kagome magnetism and rare-earth local moment magnetism."}

Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We characterize an equivalence between MSNE and the rest points of the proposed mean field evolutionary model and we give conditions for the evolutionary stability of MSNE."}

This is in addition to the wide interest in the application of operator methods for better understanding of fluid flows. A particular problem of relevance to all such applications is, how does the Koopman or the Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator change if the underlying vector field of the dynamical system undergoes small changes or if two vector fields are added. The current numerical methods rely on significant computations and model or parameter changes to the dynamical system often require all the computations to be repeated. This paper reports on a novel approach to the computation of the approximate PF and Koopman operators in such cases. The approach makes use of the exponentials of the infinitesimal generators of these operators. It is shown that this approximation depends on the Lie bracket of the vector field and the perturbation vector field. Examples are described where the Koopman and PF operators are constructed from operators of primitive flows and for cases where the model parameters undergo perturbations."}

Here, we demonstrate how the prototypical material of K2Cr8O16 undergoes a ferromagnetic MIT accompanied by a change in band topology. Through inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering experiments combined with first-principles theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that this transition is not driven by a Peierls mechanism, given the lack of phonon softening. Instead, we establish the transition as a topological MIT within the ferromagnetic phase (topological-FM-MIT) with potential axionic properties, where electron correlations play a key role in stabilizing the insulating state. This work pioneers the discovery of a topological-FM-MIT and represents a fundamentally new class of topological phase transitions, revealing a unique pathway through which magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations interact."}

An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.\n  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.\n  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.\n  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p < 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D.

Though formally equivalent, the two theories embody distinct modes of knowing: procedural construction and recognitional verification. These epistemic architectures anticipate, in philosophical form, the logical asymmetry expressed by the P versus NP problem in computational complexity. Here, the contrast between efficient generation and efficient recognition is treated not as a mathematical taxonomy but as a framework for understanding how knowledge is produced and validated across physics, computation, and cognition. The essay reconstructs the mathematical history of quantum mechanics through the original derivations of Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Paul Dirac, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Ehrenfest, and Wolfgang Pauli, culminating in John von Neumann's unification of both approaches within the formalism of Hilbert space. By juxtaposing Heisenberg's algorithmic formalism with Schrödinger's representational one, it argues that their divergence reveals a structural feature of scientific reasoning itself-the enduring tension between what can be procedurally constructed and what can only be recognized."}

While the case of imaging data obtained from a single study condition has already been intensively studied, confidence statements about the intersection, or union, of the excursion sets derived from different subject conditions have only been introduced recently. Such methods aim to model the images from different study conditions as asymptotically Gaussian random processes with differentiable sample paths.\n  In this work, we remove the restricting condition of differentiability and only require continuity of the sample paths. This allows for a wider range of applications including many settings which cannot be treated with the existing theory. To achieve this, we introduce a novel notion of convergence on piecewise continuous functions over finite partitions. This notion is of interest in its own right, as it implies convergence results for maxima of sequences of piecewise continuous functions over sequences of sets. Generalizing well-known results such as the extended continuous mapping theorem, this novel convergence notion also allows us to construct for the first time confidence regions for mathematically challenging examples such as symmetric differences of excursion sets."}

We compare this timescale with the inverse of the maximum Lyapunov exponent $λ$ and its saturation time, which are systematically shorter. The Toda integral ergodization/equilibrium time is system size independent for long chains, but show dramatic growth when the system size is smaller than a critical one, whose value depends on the energy density. We measure the dependence of energy density on the critical system size and relate this observation to the possible emergence of a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser regime. We numerically determine the critical energy density of this regime, finding that it approximately decays as $1/N^2$ with the number of particles N."}

This hierarchical mixture framework decomposes the complexity of model specification at different levels of hierarchy, for which parsimonious covariance models can be specified with simple mixing measures to yield flexible properties and closed-form derivation. A characterization theorem is provided for the hierarchical mixture approach on how the mixing measures determine the statistical properties of covariance functions.

It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $ω/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled."}

We introduce a novel theoretical perspective on the asymptotic properties of regression adjustment through a Neumann-series decomposition, yielding a systematic higher-degree corrections and a refined analysis of regression adjustment.

The interpretation of its in-plane anisotropy has remained unsettled due to structural twinning, which superimposes orthogonal magnetic responses. Here we combine controlled crystal growth with magnetization and rotational magnetometry to disentangle the effects of twinning. Nearly untwinned high-quality single crystals reveal the intrinsic in-plane anisotropy: the in-plane easy axis saturates at $M_{\\text{easy}}(4~\\text{T}) \\approx 1.8~μ_{\\text{B}}$/Ce, while the in-plane hard axis magnetization is strongly suppressed, nearly linear, and comparable to the out-of-plane response. These results resolve long-standing discrepancies in reported magnetic measurements, in which in-plane metamagnetic transition fields and saturation magnetization varied significantly across previous studies. Growth experiments demonstrate that avoiding the proposed $α$-$β$ structural transition $-$ through Sb-rich flux and slower cooling $-$ systematically reduces twinning. However, powder X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis measurements show no clear evidence of a distinct $β$ phase. Our results establish a consistent magnetic phase diagram and provide essential constraints for crystal-electric field models, enabling a clearer understanding of the interplay between anisotropic magnetism and unconventional superconductivity in CeSb$_2$."}

In practice, only a small fraction elements in high-dimensional data are of interest, such as the $k$ largest or smallest elements. Thus, retrieving the $k$ largest/smallest elements from a low-rank tensor is a fundamental and important task in a wide variety of applications. In this paper, we first model the top-$k$ elements retrieval problem to a continuous constrained optimization problem. To address the equivalent optimization problem, we develop a block-alternating iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into a sequence of small-scale subproblems. Leveraging the separable summation structure of the objective function, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve these subproblems in an alternating manner. Numerical experiments with tensors from synthetic and real-world applications demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability."}

This hierarchical mixture approach provides a unified modeling framework that not only constructs a new class of asymmetric space-time covariance functions with closed-form expressions, but also provides corresponding space-time process representations, which further unify constructions for many existing space-time covariance models. This hierarchical mixture framework decomposes the complexity of model specification at different levels of hierarchy, for which parsimonious covariance models can be specified with simple mixing measures to yield flexible properties and closed-form derivation. A characterization theorem is provided for the hierarchical mixture approach on how the mixing measures determine the statistical properties of covariance functions. Several new covariance models resulting from this hierarchical mixture approach are discussed in terms of their practical usefulness. A theorem is also provided to construct a general class of valid asymmetric space-time covariance functions with arbitrary and possibly different degrees of smoothness in space and in time and flexible long-range dependence. The proposed covariance class also bridges a theoretical gap in using the Lagrangian reference framework. The superior performance of several new parsimonious covariance models over existing models is verified with the well-known Irish wind data and the U.S. air temperature data."}

In marine science, it is common for biologists and geologists to identify regional differences based on expert knowledge, frequently through data visualization. However, time series data collected through surveys in marine studies typically span only a few decades, limiting the applicability of classical time series methods. Additionally, without expert knowledge, detecting significant differences becomes challenging. To address these issues, we introduce ANOVATS (ANOVA for small-sample time series data), a subsampling-based method to detect regional differences in small-sample time series data with a fixed number of groups. This method bypasses the need for spectral density estimation, which requires a large number of time points in the data. Furthermore, after detecting differences in homogeneity across all areas using the ANOVATS procedure, we devised a simple ANOVATS post hoc procedure to group the areas. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by analyzing zooplankton biomass data collected in different strata of the North Sea, showing its ability to quantify differences in species between geographical areas without relying on prior biological or geographical knowledge."}

We show that in the limit in which $1/S \\to 0$ and $J_{xy} \\to 0$ at fixed $V = J_{zz}/(S J_{xy})$, the triangular spin model can be reduced to an effective boson model with quartic interactions on the honeycomb lattice. This effective model interpolates between a spin-wave ($V \\to 0$) and a strong-coupling limit ($V \\to \\infty$), and encodes in a simple framework the regimes discussed by Kleine et al. [Z. Phys. B Condens. Matter 86, 405 (1992); 87, 103 (1992)]. For zero field, the classical ground state of the model presents an accidental degeneracy, which has a particularly simple form and which can be expressed in terms of a simple symmetry of the classical energy. The model thus offers a particularly transparent realization of a theory with quantum order-by-disorder and a pseudo-Goldstone mode. We analyze the spectrum at zero magnetic field by calculating the self-energy at one-loop order, using a self-consistent renormalization of the gap and the energy scale. Within the self-consistent approximation considered here, the corrections present a complex evolution as a function of $V$. We discuss the one-loop corrections in comparison with the spectrum observed experimentally in K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$."}

Heterogeneity is a fundamental problem for many real-world systems largely because it resists many concentration arguments. In this paper, we assume that each of the $N$ arms can have different model parameters. We show that, under a mild assumption of uniform ergodicity, a natural finite-horizon LP-update policy with randomized rounding, that was originally proposed for the homogeneous case, achieves an $O(\\log N\\sqrt{1/N})$ optimality gap in infinite time average reward problems for fully heterogeneous RMABs. In doing so, we show results that provide strong theoretical guarantees on a well-known algorithm that works very well in practice. The LP-update policy is a model predictive approach that computes a decision at time $t$ by planing over a time-horizon $\\{t\\dots t+τ\\}$. Our simulation section demonstrates that our algorithm works extremely well even when $τ$ is very small and set to $5$, which makes it computationally efficient. Our theoretical results draw on techniques from the model predictive control literature by invoking the concept of \\emph{dissipativity} and generalize quite easily to the more general weakly coupled heterogeneous Markov Decision Process setting. In addition, we draw a parallel between our own policy and the LP-index policy by showing that the LP-index policy corresponds to $τ=1$. We describe where the latter's shortcomings arise from and how under our mild assumption we are able to address these shortcomings. The proof of our main theorem answers an open problem posed by (Brown et al 2020), paving the way for several new questions on the LP-update policies."}

We further analyze two existing triangular low-discrepancy point sets and prove that their mesh ratios are uniformly bounded, thereby establishing their quasi-uniformity.

The parameters of the distribution are taken to be weights which are positive and sum to one and are thus defined on a regular simplex. The approach to analysis is presented for likelihood-based and Bayesian inference and is illustrated by example, with datasets taken from the literature and, in one case, used to generate semi-synthetic data. The analysis of two-by-two contingency tables using the univariate Wallenius distribution is shown to be straightforward, with the parameter a single weight which translates immediately to the requisite odds and the odds ratio. The analysis of contingency tables with more than two groups based on the multivariate Wallenius distribution was however more nuanced than that of the two-group tables. Specifically, some numerical subtleties were required in order to implement the necessary calculations. In particular, optimisation with respect to the weights was performed by transforming the weights to yield an unconstrained optimisation problem and likelihoods which are extremely small were scaled by an appropriate multiplying factor without compromising the elements of inference. Furthermore, a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian inference, termed the sphere walk Metropolis, was constructed. The proposal is implemented in Cartesian coordinates on the reference simplex and the Metropolis filter in barycentric coordinates on the regular simplex, with the transition between barycentric and Cartesian coordinates effected seamlessly."}

Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave. We dub this property a \\textit{Meissner polariton}, that is, a collective mode resulting from the hybridization of light with order parameter oscillations. Furthermore, near the onset of symmetry breaking, strong fluctuations give rise to a superconducting-like response even in the absence of a Meissner effect or of a Meissner polariton. Our results are relevant to experiments on light-induced orders, particularly superconductivity."}

The resulting MV singular dividend control problem is time-inconsistent, and we follow a game-theoretic approach to find a time-consistent equilibrium strategy. Our main contribution is a new verification theorem for the novel dividend problem, in which the MV criterion is applied to an integral of the control until ruin, a random time that is endogenous to the problem.

Our approach is based on local histopolation methods defined through unisolvent triples, where the edge weights are induced by probability densities. We present a general strategy that applies to arbitrary polynomial order~$k$, in which edge moments are taken against orthogonal polynomials associated with the chosen densities. This yields a systematic framework for weighted reconstructions of any degree, with theoretical guarantees of unisolvency and fully explicit basis functions. As a concrete and flexible instance, we introduce a two-parameter family of Jacobi-type distributions on $[-1,1]$, together with its symmetric Gegenbauer subclass, and show how these densities generate new quadratic reconstruction operators that generalize the standard linear histopolation scheme while preserving its simplicity and locality. We employ an adaptive parameter selection algorithm for Jacobi densities, which automatically tunes the distribution parameters to minimize the global reconstruction error. This strategy enhances robustness and adaptivity across different function classes and mesh resolutions. The effectiveness of the proposed operators is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments, which confirm their superior accuracy in approximating both smooth and highly oscillatory functions. Finally, the framework is sufficiently general to accommodate any admissible edge density, thus providing a flexible and broadly applicable tool for weighted function reconstruction."}

Nevertheless, what to cluster over is sometimes unknown. For instance, in the case of cross-sectional survey samples, clusters may be households, municipalities, counties, or states. A few approaches have been proposed, although they are based on asymptotics. I propose a new method to address this issue that works in a finite sample: reclustering. That is, we randomly and repeatedly group fine clusters into new gross clusters and calculate a statistic such as CRSEs. Under the null hypothesis that fine clusters are independent of each other, how they are grouped into gross clusters should not matter for any cluster-sensitive statistic. Thus, if the statistic based on the original clustering is a significant outlier against the distributions of the statistics induced by reclustering, it is reasonable to reject the null hypothesis and employ gross clusters. I compare the performance of reclustering with that of a few previous tests using Monte Carlo simulation and application."}

The open-source DG framework FLEXI has recently been extended to support DG schemes on general polytopal elements including tetrahedra, prisms, and pyramids. This advancement enables simulations on complex geometries where purely hexahedral meshes are difficult or impossible to generate. However, the use of meshes with heterogeneous element types introduces a workload imbalance, a consequence of the temporal evolution of modal rather than nodal degrees of freedom and the accompanying transformations. In this work, we present a lightweight, system-agnostic in-memory load balancing strategy designed for high-order DG solvers. The method employs high-precision runtime measurements and efficient data redistribution to dynamically reassign mesh elements along a space-filling curve. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex and large-scale parallel runs on the EuroHPC pre-exascale system MareNostrum 5. Results show that the proposed strategy recovers a significant fraction of the lost efficiency on heterogeneous meshes while retaining excellent strong and weak scaling."}

We tailor these methods to the case of spatial modelling and examine their efficacy at inferring extremal dependence and performing extrapolation. The geometric approach is based around a limit set described by a gauge function, which is a key target for inference. We consider a variety of spatially-parameterised gauge functions and perform inference on them by building on the framework of Wadsworth and Campbell (2024), where extreme radii are modelled via a truncated gamma distribution. We also consider spatial modelling of the angular distribution, for which we propose two candidate models. Estimation of extreme event probabilities is possible by combining draws from the radial and angular models respectively. We compare our method with two other established frameworks for spatial extreme value analysis and show that our approach generally allows for unbiased, albeit more uncertain, inference compared to the more classical models. We apply the methodology to a space weather dataset of daily geomagnetic field fluctuations."}

While Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots are widely used, Mean Residual Life (MRL) plots may offer a more intuitive display of prognosis over time. However, little is known about clinicians' knowledge and preferences regarding these alternatives. This pre-post pilot cross-sectional survey assessed 32 medical students and doctors who interpreted four survival plot types (KM, survival difference, MRL, and MRL difference) before and after a brief learning section. Interpretation accuracy, learning gain, and ranking preferences were analyzed. Overall accuracy improved from 50.0 percent pre-learning to 81.2 percent post-learning (p = 0.002), with the largest improvement for MRL plots (+37.5 percentage points). KM plots remained the most preferred for ease of clinical use (59 percent), while MRL plots were valued for patient communication (9 percent). Participants with lower self-rated survival knowledge showed the greatest learning gains. These findings suggest that with minimal instruction, clinicians can interpret MRL plots as effectively as KM plots. Incorporating MRL visualizations into clinical dashboards and medical education could improve understanding of survival outcomes and patient-centered communication."}

We show that for systems with an infinite buffer, the optimal service rate policy is monotone. However, the optimal policy is not necessarily monotone when capacity is finite. Furthermore, we prove that the set of possible optimal actions can be reduced to the lower boundary of the convex hull of the action space and develop an efficient policy iteration algorithm.

Our approach builds on multi-level latent variable models to decompose phenotypic covariance into interpretable genetic and environmental components, incorporating both within- and between-family variations.

Heemels", "Mauro Salazar"], "title": "Evolutionary Analysis of Continuous-time Finite-state Mean Field Games with Discounted Payoffs", "comment": null, "summary": "We consider a class of continuous-time dynamic games involving a large number of players. Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We characterize an equivalence between MSNE and the rest points of the proposed mean field evolutionary model and we give conditions for the evolutionary stability of MSNE."}

It is proven that the pointwise a posteriori error estimator is reliable and efficient, up to some logarithmic factors of the mesh size. The constants involved in the reliability and efficiency are independent of the gaps among the targeted eigenvalues, the mesh size and the number of mesh level. Specially, we obtain a by-product that edge residuals dominate the a posteriori error in the sense of $L^{\\infty}$-norm when the linear element is used. With the aid of the weighted Sobolev stability of the $L^2$-projection, we also propose a new method to prove the reliability of the a posteriori error estimator for higher order finite elements. A key ingredient in the a posteriori error analysis is some new estimates for regularized derivative Green's functions. Some numerical experiments verify our theoretical results."}

While numerous methods have been developed for ITR estimation, there is limited research on model updating that accounts for shifted treatment-covariate relationships in the ITR setting. In real-world practice, models trained on source data must be updated for new (target) datasets that exhibit shifts in treatment effects. To address this challenge, we propose a Reluctant Transfer Learning (RTL) framework that enables efficient model adaptation by selectively transferring essential model components (e.g., regression coefficients) from source to target data, without requiring access to individual-level source data. Leveraging the principle of reluctant modeling, the RTL approach incorporates model adjustments only when they improve performance on the target dataset, thereby controlling complexity and enhancing generalizability. Our method supports multi-armed treatment settings, performs variable selection for interpretability, and provides theoretical guarantees for the value convergence. Through simulation studies and an application to a real data example from the Best Apnea Interventions for Research (BestAIR) trial, we demonstrate that RTL outperforms existing alternatives. The proposed framework offers an efficient, practically feasible approach to adaptive treatment decision-making under evolving treatment effect conditions."}

While robust point estimation in this setting is well understood, statistical inference remains challenging, especially because the contamination proportion is not identifiable from the data. We develop a new algorithm that constructs confidence intervals for individual regression coefficients without any prior knowledge of the contamination level. Our method is based on a Z-estimation framework using a smooth estimating function. The method directly quantifies the uncertainty of the estimating equation after a preprocessing step that decorrelates covariates associated with the nuisance parameters. We show that the resulting confidence interval has valid coverage uniformly over all contamination distributions and attains an optimal length of order $O(1/\\sqrt{n(1-ε)^2})$, matching the rate achievable when the contamination proportion $ε$ is known. This result stands in sharp contrast to the adaptation cost of robust interval estimation observed in the simpler Gaussian location model."}

For a general closed planar curve, our computational method resolves both the interior and exterior Green's functions with the source placed either in the bulk or on the surface -- yielding four distinct functions. Our method exactly represents the singular nature of the Green's function by decomposing the singular and regular components. In the case of the interior function, we exactly prescribe an integral constraint which is necessary to obtain a unique solution given the arbitrary constant solution associated with Neumann boundary conditions. Our implementation is based on a fast integral method for the regular part of the Green's function which allows for a rapid and high order discretization for general domains. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method for simple geometries such as disks and ellipses where closed form solutions are available. To exhibit the usefulness of these new routines, we demonstrate several applications to open problems in the capture of Brownian particles, specifically, how the small traps or boundary windows should be configured to maximize the capture rate of Brownian particles."}

In randomized experiments, regression adjustment can improve precision of estimators using covariates, without requiring a correctly specified outcome model. However, existing design-based analyses establish asymptotic normality only up to $p = o(n^{1/2})$, extendable to $p = o(n^{2/3})$ with a single de-biasing. We introduce a novel theoretical perspective on the asymptotic properties of regression adjustment through a Neumann-series decomposition, yielding a systematic higher-degree corrections and a refined analysis of regression adjustment. Specifically, for ordinary least squares regression adjustment, the Neumann expansion sharpens analysis of the remainder term, relative to the residual difference-in-means. Under mild leverage regularity, we show that the degree-$d$ Neumann-corrected estimator is asymptotically normal whenever $p^{ d+3}(\\log p)^{ d+1}=o(n^{ d+2})$, strictly enlarging the admissible growth of $p$. The analysis is purely randomization-based and does not impose any parametric outcome models or super-population assumptions."}

This results from an inherent risk in road traffic, which arises from multiple sources of complexity and can never be fully eliminated. One central challenge lies in developing a defensible case that the residual risk has been reduced to a reasonable level. While a safety argumentation is a common means to represent this case, there is a need to guide its creation and maintenance by adequate processes. In this paper, we derive requirements for a safety argumentation lifecycle based on examining the current state of the art. In particular, the requirement-driven process design accounts for both identified limitations of current process specifications and implicit knowledge contained in related work. Subsequently, we reflect on interdependencies between the resulting safety argumentation lifecycle and the system lifecycle. Moreover, we discuss a gap in literature regarding transparent ex ante risk communication. Correspondingly, we introduce the concept of representation-supported communication that is based on deriving representations from the argumentation with respect to target stakeholders and communication purposes. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be integrated into the system lifecycle to facilitate stakeholder communication."}

Our bioreactor-based control architecture comprises a mixing chamber where both strains are co-cultured and a reservoir sustaining the slower-growing strain.

This paper develops a lossless convexification framework for the fuel-optimal control of linear systems with discrete-valued inputs. We extend existing Mayer-form results by showing that, under simple geometric conditions, system normality is preserved when reformulating Lagrange-form problems into Mayer-form. Furthermore, we derive explicit algebraic conditions for normality in systems with cross-polytopic input sets.
