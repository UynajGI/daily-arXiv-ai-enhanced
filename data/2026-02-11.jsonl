The SU(2) manifold structure is handled through a quaternion parameterization. The model is trained on 10,000 configurations generated via Hybrid Monte Carlo at a fixed coupling $β_0= 2.0$ on an $8\\times 8$ lattice, augmented to 20,000 samples via random gauge transformations. Through physics-conditioned sampling exploiting the linear $β$-dependence of the score function, we generate configurations at different values of the coupling without retraining; through the fully convolutional U-Net architecture with periodic boundary conditions, we generate configurations on lattices of different spatial extents. We validate our approach by comparing the average plaquette and Wilson action density against exact analytical predictions. At the training lattice size ($8\\times 8$), the model reproduces the exact plaquette with biases $|Δ| \\leq 0.001$ for $β\\in [1.5, 2.5]$ and $|Δ| < 0.06$ across $β\\in [1, 4]$. For lattices sharing the training extent $L=8$ in at least one direction, biases remain below $\\sim 0.003$ for $β\\in [1.5, 2.5]$, with larger deviations at higher couplings. This work demonstrates that diffusion models are a promising tool for non-Abelian gauge field generation and motivates further investigation toward higher-dimensional theories."}

To do that we put together results of old numerical simulations and results of more recent investigations. The starting point is the expectation that gauge theories admit a dual description in terms of monopoles. The strategy is then to construct the creation operator $μ$ of a monopole and to compute its vacuum expectation value $\\langle μ\\rangle$ , the disorder parameter which indicates dual superconductivity. The Imechanism of confinement is dual superconductivity of vacuum if $\\langle μ\\rangle \\neq 0 $ in the confined phase , and $\\langle μ\\rangle =0$ in the deconfined phase. Confinement has to be certified by independent methods.\n  It is shown that gauge invariance requires that field strengths be replaced by gauge invariant field strengths, which are their parallel transports to infinity. The resulting disorder parameter is a sum of correlation functions of gauge invariant field strength, and its behaviour understood by use of existing lattice data of two-point gauge invariant correlations.\n  As a byproduct an apparent existing inconsistency, the lack of preferred orientation in colour space of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes, is resolved."}

A numerical study of the expectation value of the simplicity performed in the framework of Lattice Gauge Theories enables us to determine the deconfinement temperature to a higher degree of accuracy than that reached by conventional methods at a comparable computational effort.

Standard INS yields bulk elemental concentrations, but spatially resolved measurements require techniques such as Associated Particle Imaging (API), which pairs neutron detection with coincident alpha detection to reconstruct the location of the neutron interaction. One of the unique advantages of API is its capability to measure all major soil components simultaneously, allowing for the estimation of both bulk density and water content directly from the measured neutron-induced gamma-ray spectra. Accurate interpretation of bulk INS-API data depends on correcting for both gamma-ray and neutron attenuation in soil. Although gamma attenuation can be calculated from known mass attenuation coefficient data and density, neutron attenuation is more complex, depending on neutron energy, soil composition, bulk density, and hydrogen content from water and organic matter. We use Monte Carlo simulations of soils with varied compositions, bulk densities, and water contents to model neutron attenuation and develop a simple predictive model requiring only dry bulk density and volumetric water content. We validate this model experimentally using an INS-API system with controlled soil columns, finding agreement within 10 percent at 30 cm depth. This approach enables practical, field-ready correction of INS-API measurements for neutron attenuation, laying the groundwork for a self-consistent measurement framework that can address the elemental composition of soil carbon assessments."}

To address these limitations, we propose Brain Transformer with Adaptive Mutual-Distill and Selective Prior Fusion (BrainTAP). We introduce Adaptive Mutual Distill (AMD), which enables layer-wise information exchange between modalities through learnable distill-intact ratios, preserving modality-specific signals while capturing cross-modal synergies. We further develop Selective Prior Fusion (SPF), which integrates expert-defined anatomical priors in an adaptive way.

The corresponding posterior mean is shown to converge uniformly at the posterior contraction rate in the sense of satisfying a concentration inequality. Distinguishability for bounded alternatives separated from a composite null hypothesis at the posterior contraction rate is established using infimum plug-in tests based on the posterior mean and also on maximum a posteriori estimators.

Here we tackle this challenge by directly solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation with neural-network variational Monte Carlo, which provides a highly expressive variational wavefunction for strongly correlated systems. Applying this technique to transition metal dichalcogenide moiré semicondutors, we predict itinerant ferromagnetism in WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ and an antiferromagnetic insulator in twisted $Γ$-valley homobilayer, using the same neural network without any physics input beyond the microscopic Hamiltonian. Crucially, both types of magnetic states are obtained from a single calculation within the $S_z=0$ sector, removing the need to compute and compare multiple $S_z$ sectors. This significantly reduces computational cost and paves the way for faster and more reliable magnetic material design."}

We investigate rules which update a posterior distribution into an antedata distribution when a portion of data is removed. In such context, a rule which does not destroy or create information is called the optimal information deletion rule and we prove that it coincides with the traditional use of Bayes' theorem."}

Using time-series data of this observable, we infer the unknown parameters of the mean-field equations and reconstruct the dynamics of unobserved (hidden) macroscopic variables.

The current estimate of the global warming threshold for the onset of an AMOC collapse is +4C. However, such a threshold may not be meaningful because AMOC stability depends on the rate of radiative forcing and background climate state. Here, we identify an AMOC stabilising mechanism that operates on timescales longer than present-day radiative forcing increase. Slow forcing permits coherent adjustment of surface and interior ocean properties, supported by enhanced evaporation and reduced sea-ice extent, counteracting destabilising feedbacks. This mechanism is explicitly demonstrated in a slow CO2 increase experiment (+0.5 ppm/yr), in which the AMOC remains stable up to +5.5C of global warming. By contrast, under intermediate- and high-emission scenarios, the AMOC collapses at substantially lower warming levels (+2.2C and +2.8C, respectively). Our findings demonstrate the strong radiative forcing path dependence of AMOC tipping and imply that limiting the rate of radiative forcing is critical for reducing the near-term risk of an AMOC collapse."}

By respectively constructing the equivalent transparent boundary conditions of acoustic and elastic waves simultaneously, the well-posedness and exponential convergence of the solution to the associated truncated PML problem are established. The finite element method is applied to solve the PML problem of acoustic-elastic interaction. To address the singularity caused by the non-smooth surface of the elastic body, we establish a residual-type a posteriori error estimate and develop an adaptive PML finite element algorithm. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive algorithm."}

As this paper will show, the idea of physical waves associated with particles had its roots in work by Einstein and de Broglie, who both originally thought of these waves as propagating in three-dimensional physical space. De Broglie quickly turned this wave-particle duality into an early pilot-wave theory, on which a particle's associated phase wave piloted or guided the particle along its trajectory. Schrödinger built on de Broglie's phase-wave hypothesis to provide a comprehensive account of the nascent quantum theory. However, Schrödinger's new undulatory mechanics came at the cost of replacing de Broglie's phase waves propagating in physical space with a wave function propagating in a system's abstract configuration space. The present work will argue that this move from three-dimensional physical space to a many-dimensional configuration space was a key reason why the founders of quantum theory uniformly abandoned the physical reality of the wave function. This paper will further clarify that de Broglie introduced two distinct pilot-wave theories, and will then argue that it was Bohm's rediscovery of the second of these two pilot-wave theories over two decades later, as well as Bohm's vociferous defense of wave-function realism, that were responsible for resurrecting the idea of an ontological wave function. This idea ended up playing a central role in Everett's development of the many-worlds interpretation."}

We model an 88-variable portfolio optimization involving carbon sequestration, biodiversity connectivity, and social impact metrics, executed on intermediate-scale IBM Quantum hardware (ibm_torino and ibm_fez). The results of seven independent hardware runs demonstrate that the QAOA+ZNE workflow consistently outperforms a classical greedy baseline. The quantum method achieves a mean portfolio score of 58.47 +/- 6.98, corresponding to a 31.6% improvement over the classical heuristic (44.42), with high statistical significance (p = 0.0009) and a large effect size (Cohen's d = 2.01), where ZNE yields extrapolated expectation values of the portfolio objective rather than a discrete portfolio solution without noise. A validation run conducted after a 13-day interval confirms the temporal stability of the methodology against hardware calibration drifts. These findings establish empirical quantum utility in an environmental science context, showing that current NISQ-era devices, when coupled with rigorous error mitigation, can identify complex territorial synergies that myopic classical approaches overlook.

We ask three questions: how extremist violence impacts community behaviour; whether news coverage of political entities predicts shifts in conversation dynamics; and whether linguistic diffusion occurs between mainstream and extremist spaces and across extremist ideologies. Methodologically, we combine counterfactual synthesis to estimate event-level impacts with vector autoregression and Granger causality analyses to model ongoing relationships among news signals, behavioural outcomes, and cross-community language change. Across analyses, our results indicate that Stormfront and r/News appear to be more reactive to external stimuli, while Incels demonstrates less cross-community linguistic influence and less responsiveness to news and violent events.

While integrability is known to survive in static and periodically driven systems, its fate in the complete absence of time-translation symmetry, particularly in interacting random quantum circuits, has remained unclear. Here we construct integrable random quantum circuits built from inhomogeneous XXZ R-matrices. Remarkably, integrability is preserved for arbitrary sequences of gate layers, ranging from quasiperiodic to fully random, thereby explicitly breaking both continuous and discrete time-translation symmetry. Using large-scale time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group simulations at infinite temperature and half filling, we map out the resulting spin-transport phase diagram and identify ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes controlled by the spectral parameters of the R-matrices. The spatiotemporal structure of spin correlations within each regime depends sensitively on the inhomogeneity, exhibiting spatial asymmetry and sharp peak structures tied to near-degenerate quasiparticle velocities. To account for these findings, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics framework adapted to time-dependent integrable circuits, yielding Euler-scale predictions for correlation functions, Drude weights, and diffusion bounds. This approach identifies the quasiparticles governing transport and quantitatively captures both the scaling exponents and fine structures of the correlation profiles observed numerically. Our results demonstrate that exact Yang-Baxter integrability is compatible with stochastic quantum dynamics and establish generalized hydrodynamics as a predictive framework for transport in time-dependent integrable systems."}

Computationally, by identifying the algebraic associativity of the analytic solution, we reformulate adaptive physical integration as a parallel prefix-sum problem, achieving log-linear sequence parallelism. UniPhy establishes a physically complete foundation model architecture that unifies geometric adaptivity, thermodynamic consistency, and computational efficiency.

One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct an array of spin singlet and/or triplet qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings describe a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits and therefore provide a platform for performing many-body quantum simulations on spin excitations like magnons and triplons."}

We develop station-level detection probabilities using logistic regression and combine them across a seismic network to compute spatial magnitude-of-completeness fields. We apply this approach to two catalogs from the 2016-2017 Central Italy sequence that were constructed from the same seismic network, one routine and one ML based. At the station level, the ML picker increases detection sensitivity by identifying smaller magnitude events and detecting earthquakes at greater distances. Spatially, the magnitude-of-completeness decreases substantially, with median values shifting from 1.6 to 0.5 for P waves and from 1.7 to 0.5 for S waves. However, the ML catalog also shows greater variability in station-level performance than the routine catalog. These results demonstrate that ML-based improvements in detectability are widespread but spatially non-uniform, highlighting their benefits, their limitations, and the potential for further improvements."}

Growing complexity in incentive structures has expanded the applicability of blockchain beyond purely transactional use. Existing research predominantly examines token economies within specific use cases, proposes conceptual frameworks, or studies isolated aspects such as governance, incentive design, and tokenomics. However, the literature offers limited empirically grounded, end-to-end guidance that integrates these dimensions into a coherent, step-by-step design approach informed by concrete token-economy development efforts. To address this gap, this paper presents the Token Economy Design Method (TEDM), a design-science artifact that synthesizes stepwise design propositions for token-economy design across incentives, governance, and tokenomics. TEDM is derived through an iterative qualitative synthesis of prior contributions and refined through a co-designed case. The artifact is formatively evaluated via the Currynomics case study and additional expert interviews. Currynomics is an ecosystem that maintains the Redcurry stablecoin, using real estate as the underlying asset. TEDM is positioned as reusable design guidance that facilitates the analysis of foundational requirements of tokenized ecosystems. The specificity of the proposed approach lies in the focus on the socio-technical context of the system and early stages of its design."}

Higher-order networks, such as hypergraphs, generalize pairwise links to hyperedges and provide a natural representation of group interactions. Yet existing studies on higher-order networks largely emphasize structural effects, while the impact of imitation-based update rules and how they interact with group structures remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a class of structure-aware imitation rules on hypergraphs that explicitly parameterize how many groups are sampled and how many peers are consulted within each sampled group. Under weak selection, we derive an analytical condition for the success of cooperation for any multiplayer social dilemmas on homogeneous hypergraphs. This analysis yields an interpretable metric, information diversity, which quantifies how an update rule diversifies the sources of social information across groups. Analytical predictions and numerical simulations show that cooperation is more effectively promoted by update rules that induce higher information diversity for three representative dilemmas. Further simulations demonstrate that this principle extends to non-homogeneous hypergraphs and a broad class of multiplayer social dilemmas. Our work thus provides a unifying metric that links microscopic updating to evolutionary outcomes in higher-order networked systems and establishes a general design principle for promoting cooperation beyond pairwise interactions."}

Such a model allows the design have an arbitrary distribution of singular values and only assumes that its singular vectors are generic. It is a vast generalization of the i.i.d. Gaussian design typically considered in the theoretical literature, and is motivated by the fact that real data often have a complex correlation structure so that methods relying on i.i.d. assumptions can be highly suboptimal. Building on the paradigm of spectrally-initialized iterative optimization, this paper proposes optimal spectral estimators and combines them with an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, establishing rigorous performance guarantees for these two algorithmic steps. Both the spectral initialization and the subsequent AMP meet existing conjectures on the fundamental limits to estimation -- the former on the optimal sample complexity for efficient weak recovery, and the latter on the optimal errors. Numerical experiments suggest the effectiveness of our methods and accuracy of our theory beyond orthogonally invariant data."}

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms."}

While functional data analysis has been established for decades, causal inference with functional treatments remains largely unexplored. Existing methods typically focus on estimating the causal average dose response functional (ADRF), which requires strong positivity assumptions and offers limited interpretability. In this work, we target a new causal estimand, the modified functional treatment policy (MFTP), which focuses on estimating the average potential outcome when each individual slightly modifies their treatment trajectory from the observed one. A major challenge for this new estimand is the need to define an average over an infinite-dimensional object with no density. By proposing a novel definition of the population average over a functional variable using a functional principal component analysis (FPCA) decomposition, we establish the causal identifiability of the MFTP estimand. We further derive outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimators for the MFTP, and provide theoretical guarantees under mild regularity conditions. The proposed estimators are validated through extensive simulation studies. Applying our MFTP framework to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) accelerometer data, we estimate the causal effects of reducing disruptive nighttime activity and low-activity duration on all-cause mortality."}

Weak values first appeared in the research literature in a pair of papers in 1987 and 1988, and were originally defined as the results of a special kind of experimental protocol involving non-disturbing measurements combined with an explicit form of post-selection. In the years since, subsequent papers on weak values have produced a number of important practical spin-offs, including new methods for signal amplification and quantum-state tomography. The present work is not concerned with those practical spin-offs, but with historical and ongoing attempts to assign weak values a transparent, single-system interpretation, as well as efforts that invoke weak values to make a number of exotic claims about the properties and behavior of individual quantum systems.

It has been shown that such sensitivity is maximized when a system operates near the critical point of a phase transition. However, proximity to criticality introduces large fluctuations and diverging timescales. Hence, to leverage the maximal sensitivity, it would require impractically long integration periods. Here, we analytically and computationally demonstrate how the optimal tuning of a recurrent neural network is determined given a finite integration time. Rather than maximizing the theoretically available sensitivity, we find networks attain different sensitivities depending on the available time. Consequently, the optimal dynamic regime can shift away from criticality when integration times are finite, highlighting the necessity of incorporating finite-time considerations into studies of information processing."}

The data for this study was compiled from censuses, health research organisations, and data centres, among various other sources. We built regression models and used them to analyze trends across past decades and make projections for 2031. Our regression results show a strong inverse relationship between communicable disease DALYs and HDI. In other words, ongoing improvements in development and infrastructure significantly reduced communicable disease DALYs. In contrast, noncommunicable DALYs did not decrease despite rising HDI. And lastly, injury DALYs showed moderate declines with higher HDI, which reflects improvements in healthcare and safety systems. Gender analysis showed male overrepresentation among people with disabilities. These results from our study support that there is a need to shift public health focus toward chronic diseases and address gender disparities in disability outcomes."}

Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p<1$). This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators.

The capabilities of the model are assessed across a wide span of scenarios in thermo-mechanical fracture, from the propagation of large pre-existing cracks to crack nucleation under spatially uniform states of stress. In particular, we revisit the controlled quenching of glass plates, and demonstrate how the model captures experimentally observed crack patterns across a range of thermal loads. Ceramic disks subjected to infrared radiation are also examined, with the model reproducing both straight cracks in notched specimens and branching in intact specimens. Finally, ceramic pellets subjected to rapid power pulses are examined, with the model explaining experimental transitions from intact to fractured pellets and the important role of material strength. The results demonstrate that the complete phase-field model unifies the treatment of distinct fracture scenarios under thermal shock, surpassing classical approaches and enabling more reliable prediction of brittle fracture in extreme environments."}

Using publicly available frequency measurements, we compare periods before and after the reform based on daily frequency profiles, indicators characterizing frequency deviations, principal component analysis, Fourier-based functional data analysis, and power spectral density analysis. We show that the reform substantially reduces characteristic hourly frequency deviations and suppresses dominant spectral components at hourly and half-hourly time scales, while quarter-hourly structures gain relative importance. While the likelihood of large frequency deviations decreases overall, reductions for extreme events are less clear and depend on the metric used. Our results demonstrate that market design reforms can effectively mitigate systematic frequency deviations, but also highlight that complementary technical and regulatory measures are required to further reduce large frequency excursions in low-inertia power systems."}

It is demonstrated that the interaction-induced Hartree dispersion plays a decisive role in determining the momentum sector of low-energy spin polarons.

Our method is based on the introduction of `observers', which are randomly chosen nodes monitoring the local connectivity of a network. To demonstrate efficiency of the method, we derive explicit equations determining the susceptibility and study its critical behavior near continuous and mixed-order phase transitions in uncorrelated random undirected and directed networks, networks with dependency links, and $k$-cores of networks.

Traditional industrial solutions often decouple this into two independent tasks: video recommendation (predicting share probability) and receiver recommendation (predicting whom to share with), leading to suboptimal performance due to isolated modeling and inadequate information utilization. To address this, we propose UniShare, a novel unified framework for joint sharing prediction on both video and receiver recommendation. UniShare models the share probability through an enhanced representation learning module that incorporates pre-trained GNN and multi-modal embeddings, alongside explicit bilateral interest and relationship matching. A key innovation is our joint training paradigm, which leverages signals from both tasks to mutually enhance each other, mitigating data sparsity and improving bilateral satisfaction. We also introduce K-Share, a large-scale real-world dataset constructed from Kuaishou platform logs to support research in this domain. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that UniShare significantly outperforms strong baselines on both tasks. Furthermore, online A/B testing on the Kuaishou platform confirms its effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in key metrics including the number of shares (+1.95%) and receiver reply rate (+0.482%)."}

Unlike the Eulerian formulation, the ALE approach effectively tracks flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and contact discontinuities. However, mesh motion alters the geometry and increases computational costs. To address this, two key strategies were introduced to reduce costs and enhance accuracy. The first strategy is to use the gas-kinetic scheme to construct a third-order gas-kinetic flux, rather than the Runge-Kutta method to achieve high-order time accuracy, which allows a single reconstruction and flux calculation per time step. This approach enables direct updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients using a time-accurate flux function, facilitating compact reconstruction. Second, the significant computational expense is spent on reconstruction, which requires recalculating the reconstruction matrix at each time step due to mesh changes. A simplified fourth-order compact reconstruction using a small matrix was used to mitigate this cost. The combination of fourth-order spatial reconstruction and third-order time-accurate flux evolution ensures both high resolution and computational efficiency in the ALE framework. The tests shows that the current reconstruction is 2.4x to 3.0x faster than the previous reconstruction. Additionally, a generalized ENO(GENO) method for handling discontinuities enhances the scheme's robustness. The numerical test cases, such as the Riemann problem, Sedov problem, Noh problem, and Saltzmann problem, demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of our method."}

These models are widely studied in event history analysis, and are characterized by the state space, the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. A finite path under the multistate Markov model is a particular set of states occupied at finite time instances $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The main goal of this paper is to establish a bridge between event history analysis and algebraic statistics. The joint probabilities of finite paths in these models have a natural monomial parametrization in terms of the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. We study the polynomial relations among joint path probabilities. When the statistical constraints on the parameters are disregarded, nonhomogeneous multistate Markov models of arbitrary order can be viewed as slices of decomposable hierarchical models. This yields a complete description of their vanishing ideals as toric ideals generated by explicit families of binomials. Moreover, the variety of this vanishing ideal equals the nonhomogeneous multistate Markov model on the probability simplex. In contrast, homogeneous multistate Markov models exhibit different algebraic behavior, as time homogeneity imposes additional polynomial relations, leading to vanishing ideals that are strictly larger than in the nonhomogeneous case. We also derive families of binomial relations that vanish on homogeneous multistate Markov models. We investigate maximum likelihood estimation from statistical and algebraic perspectives. For nonhomogeneous models, classical and algebraic formulas agree; in the homogeneous case, the algebraic approach is more complex. Lastly, we provide data applications where we demonstrate the statistical theory to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters under specific multistate Markov models."}

Under an applied external field, the Kitaev spin liquids turn into a topologically non-trivial chiral spin-liquid state with non-abelian anionic excitations, which is crucial for quantum computing. Earlier theoretical predictions advocated that Kitaev physics can be realized in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators such as honeycomb irradiates and ruthenates.

Starting from a topological generalization of generalized probabilistic theories, we consider probability assignments defined as functions of an operational transition probability between pure states. We show that under three operationally motivated requirements: no superluminal signaling, availability of normal steering via purification in a sigma additive sense, and sigma affinity of probabilities under countable preparation mixtures, any admissible rule within this class must reduce to the identity. In particular, nonlinear deviations generically enable operational signaling distinctions in steering scenarios, while continuity combined with sigma affinity excludes non affine alternatives. This identifies a unique causal fixed point. Within this class of probability rules, the Born rule emerges as the only assignment compatible with no signaling in operational theories admitting normal steering. We connect the operational result to standard infinite-dimensional quantum mechanics through the normal state space of von Neumann algebras and the GNS representation, recovering the conventional Born rule for projective and generalized measurements. We discuss the scope of the assumptions and implications for proposed post quantum modifications in continuous variable and quantum field theoretic regimes."}

To control the resulting bias, we use Lyapunov drift and concentration arguments to derive exponential tail bounds on regeneration times. This allows the truncation horizon--and hence the quantum circuit depth--to be chosen such that the bias is provably negligible compared to the statistical error.

We study collective creativity using a controlled word-guessing task that balances open-endedness with an objective measure of task performance. Participants attempt to infer a hidden target word, scored based on the semantic similarity of their guesses to the target, while also observing the best guess from previous players. We compare performance and outcome diversity across human-only, AI-only, and hybrid human-AI groups. Hybrid groups achieve the highest performance while preserving high diversity of guesses. Within hybrid groups, both humans and AI agents systematically adjust their strategies relative to single-agent conditions, suggesting higher-order interaction effects, whereby agents adapt to each other's presence. Although some performance benefits can be reproduced through collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems, human-AI collaboration remains superior, underscoring complementary roles in collective creativity."}

For the cascaded system with a Dirichlet pointwise interconnection, the ODE takes the value of a Robin boundary condition at the ODE-PDE interface as its direct input, and the PDE is driven by a Dirichlet boundary input at the opposite end. We first employ the backstepping method to design a boundary controller and to decouple the cascaded system. This decoupling facilitates independent stability analysis of the PDE and ODE systems sequentially. Then, to address the challenges posed by Dirichlet boundary disturbances to the application of the classical Lyapunov method, we utilize the generalized Lyapunov method to establish the ISS in the max-norm for the cascaded system involving Dirichlet boundary disturbances and two other types of disturbances. The obtained result indicates that even in the presence of different types of disturbances, ISS analysis can still be conducted within the framework of Lyapunov stability theory. For the well-posedness of the target system, it is conducted by using the technique of lifting and the semigroup method. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and ISS properties for a cascaded system with different disturbances."}

Here we develop a first-principles framework for nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics by integrating quantum resource theory of coherence with thermodynamic laws. We derive a previously unexplored entropy balance relation that explicitly separates entropy flux due to heat exchange from entropy production arising from the loss of quantum coherence. This formulation identifies the appropriate thermodynamic entropy in nonequilibrium quantum processes as the energy entropy associated with energy measurements, demonstrating that the von Neumann entropy does not, in general, represent thermodynamic entropy away from equilibrium. Within this framework, dynamical temperature, free energy, work, and heat are consistently defined, and both the first and second laws are shown to hold far from equilibrium. Applying the theory to an exactly solvable open quantum system, we reveal how equilibrium thermodynamics emerges dynamically in the weak-coupling limit. Our results establish a unified and operational foundation for nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and clarify the fundamental thermodynamic role of quantum coherence."}

The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced."}

In the intermediate sparse regime, however, the index converges in probability to $1/4$ plus a constant that is explicitly dependent on the node distribution. Finally, in the relatively dense case, the index diverges to infinity as the graph size increases. Our results highlight the sharp contrast between the uniform case and its nonuniform counterpart."}

We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations."}

Due to an increasing demand for explanations, this may involve counterfactual queries besides the typically considered factual queries. In this work, we consider linear models and three types of queries: factual, counterfactual, and robust counterfactual. First, for an arbitrary set of queries, we derive novel mathematical formulations for the classification regions for which the decision of the unknown model is known, without recovering any of the model parameters. Second, we derive bounds on the number of queries needed to extract the model's parameters for (robust) counterfactual queries under arbitrary norm-based distances. We show that the full model can be recovered using just a single counterfactual query when differentiable distance measures are employed. In contrast, when using polyhedral distances for instance, the number of required queries grows linearly with the dimension of the data space. For robust counterfactuals, the latter number of queries doubles. Consequently, the applied distance function and robustness of counterfactuals have a significant impact on the model's security."}

Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes."}

We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect.

This dependency creates a fundamental conflict in the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws, where solution-driven adaptation may induce nonsmooth mesh motion, thereby degrading convergence order. We introduce \\emph{transport polynomial exactness} (TPE($k$)), a mesh-motion-independent criterion that generalizes classical free-stream preservation (TPE(0)) to the exact advection of degree-$k$ polynomials. We show that the classical geometric conservation law (GCL) is insufficient to ensure TPE($k$) for $k \\ge 1$ due to mismatches in higher-order geometric moments. To resolve this, we propose \\emph{evolved geometric moments} (EGMs), obtained by solving auxiliary transport equations discretized compatibly with the physical variables. We rigorously prove that second-degree EGMs evolved via the third-order strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta (SSPRK3) method coincide with the exact geometric moments. This exactness arises from a \\emph{superconvergence} mechanism wherein SSPRK3 reduces to Simpson's rule for EGM evolution. Leveraging this result, we construct a third-order conservative finite-volume rezoning moving-mesh scheme. The scheme satisfies the TPE(2) property for \\emph{arbitrary mesh motion} and \\emph{any pseudo-time step size}, thereby naturally accommodating spatiotemporally discontinuous mesh velocity. Crucially, this \\emph{breaks the efficiency bottleneck} in the conventional advection-based remapping step and reduces the required pseudo-time levels from $\\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ under bounded but discontinuous mesh velocity. Numerical experiments verify exact quadratic transport and stable third-order convergence under extreme mesh deformation, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains."}

Existing optimization methods for these problems typically require selecting stepsizes based on prior knowledge of specific problem parameters, such as Lipschitz-type constants and (geodesic) strong concavity constants. Unfortunately, these parameters are often unknown in practice. To overcome this issue, we develop single-loop adaptive methods that automatically adjust stepsizes using cumulative Riemannian (stochastic) gradient norms. We first propose a deterministic single-loop Riemannian adaptive gradient descent ascent method and show that it attains an $ε$-stationary point within $O(ε^{-2})$ iterations. This deterministic method is of independent interest and lays the foundation for our subsequent stochastic method. In particular, we propose the Riemannian stochastic adaptive gradient descent ascent method, which finds an $ε$-stationary point in $O(ε^{-6})$ iterations. Under additional second-order smoothness, this iteration complexity is further improved to $O(ε^{-4})$, which even outperforms the corresponding complexity result in Euclidean space. Some numerical experiments on real-world applications are conducted, including the regularized robust maximum likelihood estimation problem, and the robust training of neural networks with orthonormal weights. The results are encouraging and demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptivity in practice."}

Our one-loop Keldysh analysis, together with cumulant-expansion numerics, reveals sharply different critical scaling with respect to the thermodynamic scaling parameter. This establishes that weak and strong symmetries lead to distinct dynamical universality classes despite originating from the same symmetry group in the closed system.

We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction.

We develop a sensitivity analysis framework that bounds how much conclusions can change when this transportability assumption is violated. Our approach constrains the likelihood ratio between target and trial outcome densities by a scalar parameter $Λ\\geq 1$, with $Λ= 1$ recovering standard transportability. For each $Λ$, we derive sharp bounds on the target average treatment effect -- the tightest interval guaranteed to contain the true effect under all data-generating processes compatible with the observed data and the sensitivity model. We show that the optimal likelihood ratios have a simple threshold structure, leading to a closed-form greedy algorithm that requires only sorting trial outcomes and redistributing probability mass. The resulting estimator runs in $O(n \\log n)$ time and is consistent under standard regularity conditions. Simulations demonstrate that our bounds achieve nominal coverage when the true outcome shift falls within the specified $Λ$, provide substantially tighter intervals than worst-case bounds, and remain informative across a range of realistic violations of transportability."}

Notably, $α$ can take arbitrary positive values by adjusting the regularization coefficient without altering the strong convergence rate.

The traditional approach uses N-shaped and Z-shaped schedules, selecting the orientation in each plaquette to avoid hook errors aligned with logical operators. However, this becomes increasingly complex within lattice surgery primitives with varied boundary geometries, and requires a 7-step schedule to avoid gate collisions. We propose the diagonal schedule, which orients hook errors along the diagonal of each plaquette. These diagonal errors crucially never align with logical operators regardless of boundary orientation, achieving full code distance. The diagonal schedule is globally uniform: all X-type plaquettes use one schedule and all Z-type plaquettes use another, eliminating geometry-dependent planning. On hardware supporting parallel measurement, reset, and gate operations, the schedule achieves a minimal period of 6 time steps, compared to 7 for the traditional approach.

In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications."}

We propose a Zero-Inflated Beta-Binomial Mixed Effects Regression (ZIBBMR) model that augments a beta-binomial count model with a zero-inflation component, fixed effects for covariates, and subject-specific random effects, accommodating excessive zeros, overdispersion, and within-subject correlation. Maximum likelihood estimation is performed via a Stochastic Approximation EM (SAEM) algorithm with latent variable augmentation, which circumvents the model's intractable likelihood and enables efficient computation. Simulation studies show that ZIBBMR achieves accuracy comparable to leading mixed-model approaches in the literature and surpasses simpler zero-inflated count formulations, particularly in small-sample scenarios.

Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders.

This paper introduces an Extended Isolation Forest with feature sensitivities, which we refer to as the Anisotropic Isolation Forest (AIF). In contrast to the standard EIF, the AIF enables anomaly detection with controllable sensitivity to deviations in different features or directions in the feature space. The paper also introduces novel measures of directional sensitivity, which allow quantification of AIF's sensitivity in different directions in the feature space. These measures enable adjustment of the AIF's sensitivity to task-specific requirements. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by applying it to synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the AIF enables anomaly detection that focuses on directions in the feature space where deviations from typical behavior are more important."}

More specifically, Karouli clarified an important asymptotic structure of the Gaussian kernel matrix, leading to strong consistency of the eigenvectors, though the eigenvalues are inconsistent. This paper focuses on the above results and presents a consistent estimator with the use of the smallest eigenvalue, whenever the target kernel matrix tends to low rank in the asymptotic regime. Importantly, asymptotic analysis is given under a statistical model representing partial noise. Although a naive estimator is inconsistent, applying an optimization method for low rank approximations with constraints, we overcome the difficulty caused by the inconsistency, resulting in a new estimator with strong consistency in rank deficient cases."}

We show that this creates a negative feedback loop, which we call \\textit{Increasing Gap Dynamics} (IGD): when a server is assigned a spatial gap forms, which is more likely to attract new users that further widen the gap. The simplest version of our model is a one-dimensional circle, for which we derive analytical results showing that the system converges to an inefficient equilibrium, worse than both balanced and fully random distributions of servers. We prove that an optimal assignment policy always matches the user to one of its two neighbouring servers so that long gaps tend to widen. Hence, the IGD persists even when assigning optimally rather than greedily. In two dimensions, the appearance of the IGD is illustrated through simulations on a square region. Finally, simulations of a proper ride-hailing system using real data from Manhattan confirms that the IGD arises and that it is responsible for the appearance of the well-known Wild Goose Chase."}

We introduce modular techniques for implementing fault-tolerant circuits with quantum input/output interfaces using the concatenated quantum Hamming code.

While existing methods in the offline setting handle any selection mechanism that is permutation invariant to the labeled data, their extension to the online setting -- where data arrives sequentially and later decisions depend on earlier ones -- is challenged by the fact that the selection mechanism is naturally asymmetric. As such, existing methods only address a limited collection of selection mechanisms.\n  In this paper, we propose PErmutation-based Mondrian Conformal Inference (PEMI), a general permutation-based framework for selective conformal prediction with arbitrary asymmetric selection rules. Motivated by full and Mondrian conformal prediction, PEMI identifies all permutations of the observed data (or a Monte-Carlo subset thereof) that lead to the same selection event, and calibrates a prediction set using conformity scores over this selection-preserving reference set. Under standard exchangeability conditions, our prediction sets achieve finite-sample exact selection-conditional coverage for any asymmetric selection mechanism and any prediction model. PEMI naturally incorporates additional offline labeled data, extends to selection mechanisms with multiple test samples, and achieves FCR control with fine-grained selection taxonomies. We further work out several efficient instantiations for commonly-used online selection rules, including covariate-based rules, conformal p/e-values-based procedures, and selection based on earlier outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods across various selection rules on a real drug discovery dataset and investigate their performance via simulations."}

However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) -- a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory.

Common statistical indicators include increased variance and lag-one autocorrelation prior to bifurcation points. However, these indicators are sensitive to observational noise, long-term mean trends, and long-memory dependence, all of which are prevalent in climatic time series. Such effects can easily obscure genuine signals or generate spurious detections. To address these challenges, we employ a flexible Bayesian framework for modelling time-varying autocorrelation in long-range dependent time series, also accounting for time-varying variance. The approach uses a mixture of two fractional Gaussian noise processes with a time-dependent weight function to represent fractional Gaussian noise with a time-varying Hurst exponent. Inference is performed via integrated nested Laplace approximation, enabling joint estimation of mean trends and handling of irregularly sampled observations. The strengths and limitations of detecting changes in the autocorrelation is investigated in extensive simulations. Applied to real climatic data sets, we find evidence of early warning signals in a reconstructed Atlantic multidecadal variability index, while dismissing such signals for paleoclimate records spanning the Dansgaard-Oeschger events."}

Direct estimation via the Hadamard test requires controlled implementations of $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}Ht}$, and the depth of these controlled circuits grows with $t$, making long-time estimation challenging on near-term hardware. We introduce Quantum Phaselift, a lifting-based framework that estimates the rank-one matrix $Z = f f^\\dagger$ rather than estimating $f$ directly. We propose simple quantum circuits for estimating the entries of $Z$ and show that measuring only a narrow band of this matrix around the diagonal is sufficient to uniquely recover $f$. Crucially, this reformulation decouples the controlled circuit depth from the maximum evolution time to scale instead with the width of the measured band. We prove that a $O(1)$ bandwidth suffices for generic signals, leading to substantial savings in controlled operations compared to direct estimation methods. We develop three recovery algorithms with provable exact recovery in the noiseless setting and stability under measurement noise. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that high-quality recovery is possible for the 2D Fermi-Hubbard and 2D transverse-field Ising model signals of size exceeding 100 time points using only a few million measurement shots and reasonable post-processing time, making our time-series estimation techniques efficient and effective for near-term implementations."}

However, missing attributes pose a critical methodological challenge due to reluctance to share sensitive information, data collection limitations, and imperfect record linkage. Existing approaches either ignore missingness or rely on a priori imputation, potentially introducing substantial bias. In this work, we develop a novel nonparametric estimation framework using a Missing at Random assumption to identify capture probabilities under missing covariates. Using semiparametric efficiency theory, we construct one-step estimators that combine efficiency, robustness, and finite-sample validity: they approximately achieve the nonparametric efficiency bound, accommodate flexible machine learning methods through a doubly robust structure, and provide approximately valid inference for any sample size. Simulations demonstrate substantial improvements over naive imputation approaches, with our doubly robust ML estimators maintaining valid inference even at high missingness rates where competing methods fail. We apply our methodology to re-estimate mortality in the Gaza Strip from October 7, 2023, to June 30, 2024, using three-list capture-recapture data with missing demographic information.

We address this question using a data-driven approach. Based on a test set of hundreds of heterogeneous public and industrial MINLP instances, we train linear and random forest regression models to predict the relative speedup of the FICO(R) Xpress Global solver when using a branching rule that always prioritizes variables with violated integralities versus a mixed rule, allowing for early spatial branches.\n  We introduce a practical evaluation methodology that measures the effect of the learned model directly in terms of the shifted geometric mean runtime. Using only four features derived from strong branching and the nonlinear structure, our linear regression model achieves an 8-9% reduction in geometric-mean solving time for the Xpress solver, with over 10% improvement on hard instances.

Recent work, however, has demonstrated that single-graviton detection can be achieved and may be feasible in the near future. Here we show that beyond mere particle detection, these detectors provide access to the quantum state and particle statistics of gravitational waves. We show that graviton detection probabilities enable the discrimination between squeezed, coherent, and thermal radiation. We further demonstrate that the full quantum statistics contained in the second-order correlation function of the passing wave can be directly measured at the detector, independent of the weak gravitational interaction strength. Building on recent quantum-optical techniques, this capability opens the way to full quantum state tomography of Gaussian states. Our results demonstrate that single-graviton detection is not only of foundational significance but also of practical value, allowing for the characterization of quantum statistics and the states of the gravitational radiation field, which remain currently unknown."}

Under this approach, market consensus probabilities and implied model credibilities can be updated real time as each model updates, and do not require one to wait for the final outcome. Using a simulation model, it will be shown that this method is in general more accurate than traditional average log-loss and Brier score methods at distinguishing a correct model from an incorrect model. This Kelly approach is shown to have a direct mathematical and conceptual analogue to Bayesian inference, with bankroll serving as a proxy for Bayesian credibility."}

To bridge this gap, the literature has proposed strongly quasar-convex functions as an intermediate non-convex class, for which accelerated bounds have been suggested to persist. We show that this is not true in general: the additional structure of strong quasar-convexity does not suffice to guaranty better worst-case bounds for momentum compared to gradient descent. As an alternative, we study PL functions under an aiming condition that measures how well the descent direction points toward a minimizer. This perspective clarifies the geometric ingredient enabling provable acceleration by momentum when minimizing PL functions."}

From this holographic perspective, general anyon permutations in the $D(G)$ quantum double correspond to compositions of three classes of one-dimensional self-dualities, including gauging of certain subgroups of $G$, stacking with $G$ symmetry-protected topological phases, and outer automorphisms of the group $G$.

A crude comparison of the primary endpoint without covariate adjustment will suffer from biases, and the addition of regression models could improve precision by incorporating imbalanced covariates and thus help make correct inference. Desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) is a patient-centric benefit-risk evaluation methodology designed for randomized clinical trials. Still, robust covariate adjustment methods could further expand the compatibility of this method in observational studies. In DOOR analysis, each participant's outcome is ranked based on pre-specified clinical criteria, where the most desirable rank represents a good outcome with no side effects and the least desirable rank is the worst possible clinical outcome. We develop a causal framework for estimating the population-level DOOR probability, via the inverse probability of treatment weighting method, G-Computation method, and a Doubly Robust method that combines both. The performance of the proposed methodologies is examined through simulations. We also perform a causal analysis of the Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) network within the Antibacterial Resistant Leadership Group (ARLG), comparing the benefit:risk between Mono-drug therapy and Combination-drug therapy."}

While existing methods in the offline setting handle any selection mechanism that is permutation invariant to the labeled data, their extension to the online setting -- where data arrives sequentially and later decisions depend on earlier ones -- is challenged by the fact that the selection mechanism is naturally asymmetric. As such, existing methods only address a limited collection of selection mechanisms.\n  In this paper, we propose PErmutation-based Mondrian Conformal Inference (PEMI), a general permutation-based framework for selective conformal prediction with arbitrary asymmetric selection rules. Motivated by full and Mondrian conformal prediction, PEMI identifies all permutations of the observed data (or a Monte-Carlo subset thereof) that lead to the same selection event, and calibrates a prediction set using conformity scores over this selection-preserving reference set. Under standard exchangeability conditions, our prediction sets achieve finite-sample exact selection-conditional coverage for any asymmetric selection mechanism and any prediction model. PEMI naturally incorporates additional offline labeled data, extends to selection mechanisms with multiple test samples, and achieves FCR control with fine-grained selection taxonomies. We further work out several efficient instantiations for commonly-used online selection rules, including covariate-based rules, conformal p/e-values-based procedures, and selection based on earlier outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods across various selection rules on a real drug discovery dataset and investigate their performance via simulations."}

Expiry support is typically based on whether lot-specific conditional-mean confidence limits remain within specification through a proposed expiry. These limits depend on the denominator degrees-of-freedom (DDF) method used for $t$-based inference. We document an operationally important boundary-proximal phenomenon: when a fitted random-effect variance component is close to zero, Satterthwaite DDF for conditional-mean predictions can collapse, inflating $t$ critical values and producing unnecessarily wide and sometimes nonmonotone pointwise confidence limits on scheduled time grids. In contrast, containment DDF yields stable degrees of freedom and avoids sharp discontinuities as variance components approach the boundary. Using a worked example and simulation studies, we show that DDF choice can materially change pass/fail conclusions even when observed data comfortably meet specifications. Containment-based inference with the full random-effects model provides a single modeling framework that avoids the discontinuities introduced by data-dependent model reduction at arbitrary cutoffs. When containment is unavailable, a 10\\% variance-contribution reduction workflow mitigates extreme Satterthwaite behavior by simplifying the random-effects structure only when fitted contributions at the proposed expiry are negligible. An AICc step-down is also evaluated but is best treated as a sensitivity analysis, as it can be liberal when the margin between the mean trend and the specification limit at the proposed expiry is small."}

In this work, we study embedding strategies for trainable embedding quantum physics-informed neural networks (TE-QPINNs) in the context of nonlinear reaction-diffusion (RD) systems. We introduce an extended TE-QPINN (x-TE-QPINN) architecture that supports both classical and fully quantum embeddings, enabling a controlled comparison between feedforward neural network-based feature maps and parameterized quantum circuit embeddings. The first architecture is the classical embedding feed-forward neural network-based TE-QPINN (FNN-TE-QPINN), while the latter variant is a purely quantum one, referred to as quantum embedding neural network-based TE-QPINN (QNN-TE-QPINN). The proposed framework employs hardware-efficient variational quantum circuits and species-specific readout operators to approximate coupled multi-field dynamics while enforcing governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions through a physics-informed loss function. By isolating the embedding mechanism while keeping the variational ansatz, loss formulation, and optimization procedure fixed, we analyze the impact of embedding design on gradient structure, parameter scaling, and quantum resource requirements. Numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional RD equations demonstrate that quantum embeddings can replace classical embeddings without degradation in solution accuracy and, in certain regimes, exhibit improved optimization behavior compared to classical PINNs and hybrid quantum models with fixed embeddings.

Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery."}

Weak values first appeared in the research literature in a pair of papers in 1987 and 1988, and were originally defined as the results of a special kind of experimental protocol involving non-disturbing measurements combined with an explicit form of post-selection. In the years since, subsequent papers on weak values have produced a number of important practical spin-offs, including new methods for signal amplification and quantum-state tomography. The present work is not concerned with those practical spin-offs, but with historical and ongoing attempts to assign weak values a transparent, single-system interpretation, as well as efforts that invoke weak values to make a number of exotic claims about the properties and behavior of individual quantum systems. This paper challenges these interpretational claims by arguing that they involve several forms of fallacious reasoning."}

Based on the hybrid encoding, CNOT and Fredkin gates are constructed in a deterministic way without any borrowed ancillary photons or measurement-induced nonlinearities. Remarkably, the number of linear optics required to implement a CNOT gate has been reduced to one polarization beam splitter (PBS), while only $d$ PBSs are necessary to implement a generalized Fredkin gate. The optical depths of all schemes are reduced to one and dimension-independent.

We show that in quantum illumination, the achievable advantage is determined by an interplay between initial entanglement and discord. First, we rigorously show that the quantum advantage for a given state equals the amount of discord consumed for illumination. Subsequently, we find that states with identical initial discord can lead to varying advantages, indicating that the usable portion of discord for illumination depends on additional structural features of the state. Then, we consider the relation between the advantage and both entanglement and discord by performing a conditional extremal analysis. To this end, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial discord, we compute the maximum and minimum initial entanglement within each cluster. We demonstrate that, for states with fixed initial discord, the maximum (and not minimum) entanglement increases by increment of the advantage. We conclude that for any given initial discord, higher entanglement is a sufficient (but not necessary) resource for higher advantage. On the other hand, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial entanglement, we compute the maximum and minimum initial discord in each group. Here, the minimum (and not always maximum) discord scales monotonically with advantage. It shows that, for fixed initial entanglement, higher discord is a necessary (but not always sufficient) resource for higher advantage. This result provides a refined, operational perspective on how different forms of quantum correlations govern the performance of the illumination protocol. We finally find a persistent linear dependence of the advantage on initial discord in the high-noise regime, highlighting discord as the key resource for resilience to noise in the protocol."}

Fundamentally, this challenge arises from the lack of strong non-linearities on the single-photon level, meaning that photonic state preparation based on linear optics cannot benefit from the deterministic gate-based approach available to other physical platforms. Instead, the preparation of quantum states can be probabilistically implemented using single photons, linear-optical networks, and photon detection. However, determining whether an input state can be transformed into a target state using a specific measurement pattern - a problem that can be mapped to deciding the feasibility of a system of polynomial equations - is a complex problem in general. To solve it, we apply the Nullstellensatz Linear Algebra algorithm from algebraic geometry to quantum state generation; this can provide definitive no-go results by proving infeasibility when the state preparation task in question has no solution. We demonstrate this capability to validate and establish lower bounds on the physical resource requirements for the realization of several ubiquitous optical states and gates."}

A renewal formulation links slot-level success probability to long-run average FA, enabling a stochastic control problem that minimizes FA under budget and memory limits.

Using the formalism of higher-order operations, we develop an algorithm that looks for the optimal solution, and we provide an efficient numerical implementation based on semidefinite programming. Our benchmark examples, specifically those against existing analytical solutions, demonstrate how powerful and precise our method is. We further explore the potential of greedy adaptive strategies, which are based on classical feedforward to design the optimal protocol for the next round. Using this framework, we compare the optimal achievable Bayesian score across classes. We demonstrate the strength of our algorithm in several examples, from single to multiparameter estimation and with various prior distributions. Particularly, we find examples in which there is a strict hierarchy between different classes. Nonetheless, the performance of the different quantum memory-assisted classes are not significantly different, while they may significantly outperform the adaptive greedy strategy."}

Classical iterative solvers face increasing difficulty as the number of unknowns becomes large, while fully quantum linear solvers require fault-tolerant resources that remain far beyond near-term feasibility. Here we propose a quantum-accelerated conjugate gradient (QACG) framework in which a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm is used exclusively to construct a spectrally informed initial guess for a classical conjugate gradient (CG) solver. Rather than replacing classical kernels, the quantum subroutine functions as a cooperative accelerator that selectively suppresses low-energy spectral components responsible for slow classical convergence. We analyze the total runtime and resource requirements of this integrated quantum-HPC platform for the 3D Poisson equation. A central feature of QACG is a controllable decomposition of the condition number between the quantum and the classical solver, enabling flexible allocation of computational effort across quantum and classical resources. Under explicit architectural assumptions, we identify regimes in which this cooperative strategy yields a runtime advantage over purely classical approaches while requiring substantially fewer quantum resources than end-to-end quantum linear solvers. These results illustrate a concrete pathway toward the scientific and industrial use of early-stage fault-tolerant quantum computing and point to a scalable hybrid paradigm in which quantum devices act as accelerators within high-performance computing workflows rather than as standalone replacements."}

However, such a method generally requires exponentially many sampling copies due to the large magic of the target state. This work proposes a sample- and gate-efficient fidelity estimation algorithm that is affordable within feasible quantum devices. We show that the fidelity estimation with pure states close to the structure of phase states, for which sample-efficient DFE is limited by their strong entanglement and magic, can be done by using $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ sampling copies, with a single $n$-qubit fan-out gate. As the target state becomes a phase state, the sampling complexity reaches $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Such a drastic improvement stems from a crucial step in our scheme, the so-called phase stripping, which can significantly reduce the target-state magic. Furthermore, we convert a complex diagonal gate resource, which is needed to design a phase-stripping-adapted algorithm, into nonlinear classical post-processing of Pauli measurements so that we only require a single fan-out gate. Additionally, as another variant using the nonlinear post-processing, we propose a nonlinear extension of the conventional DFE scheme. Here, the sampling reduction compared to DFE is also guaranteed, while preserving the Pauli measurement as the only circuit resource. We expect our work to contribute to establishing noise-resilient quantum algorithms by enabling a significant reduction in sampling overhead for fidelity estimation under the restricted gate resources, and ultimately to clarifying a fundamental gap between the resource overhead required to understand complex physical properties and that required to generate them."}

The classical multinomial is recovered when all photons enter through a single port, the coherent sum degenerating to a single term with no interference; the quantum family is not a generalization in the Askey sense but a parallel family that departs from classical statistics through the coherence of the amplitude summation. The $r$-th factorial moment carries a squared multinomial coefficient in place of the classical single one, the extra factor arising from the two copies of the amplitude expansion whose indices the Fock state forces to agree; for the beam splitter, the third cumulant is invariant under bosonic interference and the quantum departure first appears in the fourth cumulant as negative excess kurtosis; for multiport interferometers, however, three-body interference breaks this invariance and the departure enters already at the third cumulant. Cross-mode covariances involve the phases of the scattering matrix through coherence terms that strengthen output anti-correlations beyond the classical value; together with the squared-coefficient signature in the single-mode moments, these provide low-order statistical witnesses for boson sampling verification without requiring the full permanent computation."}

Here, we analyze the mechanism of gravitationally-induced entanglement from the perspective of quantum resource theory. Building on the framework of Bose et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 240401 (2017)], we show that the gravitational interaction acts as a unitary channel, redistributing quantum resources between two spatially superposed masses. Specifically, we demonstrate that the resulting bipartite entanglement originates from the coherent conversion of local quantum coherence -- initially present in each subsystem -- into shared non-local correlations. We derive exact, analytical complementarity relations quantifying this conversion, link the decay of local coherence directly to the growth of entanglement, and support these findings with numerical simulations. Our results clarify the underlying mechanism and establish gravity as a coherence-to-entanglement conversion channel, offering a refined interpretive basis for forthcoming experimental tests. Crucially, we show that initial coherence is a necessary condition for entanglement generation and that its degree bounds the maximum achievable entanglement, with maximal entanglement requiring initial maximal coherence."}

However, in most realistic settings, quantum systems are inevitably coupled to their surrounding environment, resulting in decoherence and the consequent degradation of the QSE. Here, by investigating how local dissipative environments coupled separately to each qubit affect the steering properties geometrized by the QSE within an exact non-Markovian framework, we find that the geometry of each party's QSE is closely tied to whether a bound state forms in the energy spectrum of the total qubit-environment system. We systematically examine the characteristics of QSEs under three distinct scenarios: two-sided bound states, one-sided bound states, and no bound state, revealing a diverse range of steering types. Our work establishes quantum reservoir engineering as a tunable strategy for protecting and controlling quantum steering in open systems, offering a practical pathway toward robust steering-based quantum technologies."}

Building upon the Tucker decomposition, our method factors the target quantum state into a core tensor and mode-specific operators, enabling direct decompositions across multiple subsystems."}

While the dissipative phase diagram of the transverse DIM is only slightly shifted upward compared with its ground-state counterpart, dissipation in the longitudinal DIM stabilizes bistable nonequilibrium steady states and induces first-order phase transitions that are absent in the ground-state phase diagram. This bistable phase is characterized by the coexistence of superradiant and antiferromagnetic orders, and it converts a ground-state triple point into a tetracritical point, at which the boundaries of the first- and second-order transitions intersect. Our results reveal that the interplay among spin interactions, light-matter coupling, and dissipation supports a diverse set of nonequilibrium phase transitions and provides broad tunability of the phase diagram.

The fundamental object is a density of action states encoding the multiplicity of dynamical alternatives between configurations. Maximum-entropy inference introduces a finite resolution scale in action, implying that sufficiently close action contributions are operationally indistinguishable. We show that this indistinguishability, together with probability normalization and action additivity, selects complex amplitudes and unitary evolution as the minimal continuous representation compatible with action additivity, probability normalization, and inference under finite resolution. Quantum interference and unitarity therefore emerge as consequences of these assumptions rather than independent postulates. From the resulting propagator, the Lagrangian, Hilbert-space structure, and Schrödinger equation follow as derived consequences. In the infinitesimal-time limit, action differences universally fall below the resolution scale, making coherent summation the minimal consistent description at every step. The numerical value of the action scale is fixed empirically and identified with $\\hbar$."}

In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications."}

Unlike standard solid-state models where the topological Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) is introduced phenomenologically, we demonstrate that DMI emerges \\textit{ab initio} from the molecular stereochemistry. Specifically, the interference between the transition dipole moments of heterochiral enantiomer pairs (L-R), which breaks inversion symmetry, generates a tunable DMI that stabilizes a Chiral Luttinger Liquid phase.

From this holographic perspective, general anyon permutations in the $D(G)$ quantum double correspond to compositions of three classes of one-dimensional self-dualities, including gauging of certain subgroups of $G$, stacking with $G$ symmetry-protected topological phases, and outer automorphisms of the group $G$.

While integrability is known to survive in static and periodically driven systems, its fate in the complete absence of time-translation symmetry, particularly in interacting random quantum circuits, has remained unclear. Here we construct integrable random quantum circuits built from inhomogeneous XXZ R-matrices. Remarkably, integrability is preserved for arbitrary sequences of gate layers, ranging from quasiperiodic to fully random, thereby explicitly breaking both continuous and discrete time-translation symmetry. Using large-scale time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group simulations at infinite temperature and half filling, we map out the resulting spin-transport phase diagram and identify ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes controlled by the spectral parameters of the R-matrices. The spatiotemporal structure of spin correlations within each regime depends sensitively on the inhomogeneity, exhibiting spatial asymmetry and sharp peak structures tied to near-degenerate quasiparticle velocities. To account for these findings, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics framework adapted to time-dependent integrable circuits, yielding Euler-scale predictions for correlation functions, Drude weights, and diffusion bounds. This approach identifies the quasiparticles governing transport and quantitatively captures both the scaling exponents and fine structures of the correlation profiles observed numerically. Our results demonstrate that exact Yang-Baxter integrability is compatible with stochastic quantum dynamics and establish generalized hydrodynamics as a predictive framework for transport in time-dependent integrable systems."}

Barandes"], "title": "Historical Debates over the Physical Reality of the Wave Function", "comment": "32 pages, no figures", "summary": "This paper provides a detailed historical account of early debates over wave-function realism, the modern term for the view that the wave function of quantum theory is physically real. As this paper will show, the idea of physical waves associated with particles had its roots in work by Einstein and de Broglie, who both originally thought of these waves as propagating in three-dimensional physical space. De Broglie quickly turned this wave-particle duality into an early pilot-wave theory, on which a particle's associated phase wave piloted or guided the particle along its trajectory. Schrödinger built on de Broglie's phase-wave hypothesis to provide a comprehensive account of the nascent quantum theory. However, Schrödinger's new undulatory mechanics came at the cost of replacing de Broglie's phase waves propagating in physical space with a wave function propagating in a system's abstract configuration space. The present work will argue that this move from three-dimensional physical space to a many-dimensional configuration space was a key reason why the founders of quantum theory uniformly abandoned the physical reality of the wave function. This paper will further clarify that de Broglie introduced two distinct pilot-wave theories, and will then argue that it was Bohm's rediscovery of the second of these two pilot-wave theories over two decades later, as well as Bohm's vociferous defense of wave-function realism, that were responsible for resurrecting the idea of an ontological wave function. This idea ended up playing a central role in Everett's development of the many-worlds interpretation."}

While these phenomena are well-described by continuum hydrodynamics, a microscopic framework connecting them to their topological origins has remained elusive. Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p<1$). This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators. Our results provide a discrete microscopic description for odd diffusion, offering a powerful toolkit to predict transport in confined geometries and disordered chiral media."}
