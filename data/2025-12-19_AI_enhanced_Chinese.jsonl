For the Navier-Stokes equations, the EG formulation combines continuous Lagrange elements with a discontinuous enrichment vector per element in the velocity space and a piecewise constant pressure space, and it can be implemented efficiently within standard finite element frameworks. To enforce pressure robustness, we construct velocity reconstruction operators that map the discrete EG velocity field into exactly divergence-free, H(div)-conforming fields. In particular, we develop reconstructions based on Arbogast-Correa (AC) mixed finite element spaces on quadrilateral meshes and demonstrate that the resulting schemes remain stable and accurate even on highly distorted grids. The nonlinearity of the coupled Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq system is treated with several iterative strategies, including Picard iterations and Anderson-accelerated iterations; our numerical study shows that Anderson acceleration yields robust and efficient convergence for high Rayleigh number flows within the proposed framework. The performance of the method is assessed on a set of benchmark problems and application-driven test cases. These numerical experiments highlight the potential of pressure-robust EG methods as flexible and accurate tools for coupled flow and heat transport in complex geometries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u538b\u529b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u4f3d\u8fbd\u91d1\uff08EG\uff09\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29Navier-Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cBoussinesq\u5bf9\u6d41\u4e0b\u7684\u70ed\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5143\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u95f4\u65ad\u589e\u5f3a\u5411\u91cf\u53ca\u5206\u7247\u5e38\u6570\u538b\u529b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u901f\u5ea6\u91cd\u6784\u7b97\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u538b\u529b\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u626d\u66f2\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u52a8\u65f6\u5bf9\u538b\u529b\u654f\u611f\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u9ad8Rayleigh\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u538b\u529b\u7a33\u5065\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u4f3d\u8fbd\u91d1\uff08EG\uff09\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eedLagrange\u5143\u4e0e\u5355\u5143\u5185\u95f4\u65ad\u901f\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u9879\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u7247\u5e38\u6570\u538b\u529b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Arbogast-Correa\uff08AC\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u5143\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97H(div)-\u534f\u8c03\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u65e0\u6563\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Picard\u8fed\u4ee3\u548cAnderson\u52a0\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u626d\u66f2\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\uff1bAnderson\u52a0\u901f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8Rayleigh\u6570\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u538b\u529b\u7a33\u5065\u7684EG\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6c42\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u8026\u5408\u6d41\u52a8\u4e0e\u4f20\u70ed\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Many randomized matrix algorithms proceed by first collecting information about a matrix and then processing that data to perform some computational task. This thesis addresses the following question: How can one design algorithms that use this information as efficiently as possible, reliably achieving the greatest possible speed and accuracy for a limited data budget?\n  The first part of this thesis focuses on low-rank approximation for positive-semidefinite matrices. Here, the goal is to compute an accurate approximation to a matrix after accessing as few entries of the matrix as possible. This part of the thesis explores the randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) algorithm for this task, which achieves a level of speed and reliability greater than other methods for the same problem.\n  The second part of this thesis considers the task of estimating attributes of an implicit matrix accessible only by matrix-vector products. This thesis describes the leave-one-out approach to developing matrix attribute estimation algorithms and develops optimized trace, diagonal, and row-norm estimation algorithms.\n  The third part of this thesis considers randomized algorithms for overdetermined linear least squares problems. Randomized algorithms for linear-least squares problems are asymptotically faster than any known deterministic algorithm, but recent work has raised questions about the accuracy of these methods in floating point arithmetic. This thesis shows these issues are resolvable by developing fast randomized least-squares problem achieving backward stability, the gold-standard stability guarantee for a numerical algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\u6b63\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5177\u6709\u5411\u540e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5feb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7b97\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6253\u9776Cholesky\uff08RPCholesky\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\uff08leave-one-out\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u77e9\u9635\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8ff9\u3001\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u3001\u884c\u8303\u6570\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u5411\u540e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "RPCholesky\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5f97\u5230\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5411\u540e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d6e\u70b9\u8fd0\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) have therefore emerged as a powerful representation paradigm, as they integrate entities, relationships, time and space within a unified graph structure. They are increasingly applied across diverse domains, including environmental systems and urban, transportation, social and human mobility networks. However, modeling STKGs remains challenging: their foundations span classical graph theory as well as temporal and spatial graph models, which have evolved independently across different research communities and follow heterogeneous modeling assumptions and terminologies. As a result, existing approaches often lack conceptual alignment, generalizability and reusability. This survey provides a systematic review of spatio-temporal knowledge graph models, tracing their origins in static, temporal and spatial graph modeling. We analyze existing approaches along key modeling dimensions, including edge semantics, temporal and spatial annotation strategies, temporal and spatial semantics and relate these choices to their respective application domains. Our analysis reveals that unified modeling frameworks are largely absent and that most current models are tailored to specific use cases rather than designed for reuse or long-term knowledge preservation.

Tang"], "title": "Consensus dimension reduction via multi-view learning", "comment": null, "summary": "A plethora of dimension reduction methods have been developed to visualize high-dimensional data in low dimensions. However, different dimension reduction methods often output different and possibly conflicting visualizations of the same data. This problem is further exacerbated by the choice of hyperparameters, which may substantially impact the resulting visualization. To obtain a more robust and trustworthy dimension reduction output, we advocate for a consensus approach, which summarizes multiple visualizations into a single consensus dimension reduction visualization. Here, we leverage ideas from multi-view learning in order to identify the patterns that are most stable or shared across the many different dimension reduction visualizations, or views, and subsequently visualize this shared structure in a single low-dimensional plot. We demonstrate that this consensus visualization effectively identifies and preserves the shared low-dimensional data structure through both simulated and real-world case studies.

These interactions lead to band broadening, which can obscure the intrinsic spin-splitting in spectroscopic measurements. We consider a $d$-wave Lieb lattice altermagnet as a representative example. Our results reveal that the spin-splitting remains spectroscopically resolvable and provide theoretical estimates of lifetime effects relevant for experimental detection. For electron-magnon coupling, we find a distinct difference between spectral function broadening for up and down spins close to the Fermi surface, which is not present in the case of electron-phonon coupling. We relate it to the spin splitting of the magnon modes in altermagnets. The results, including magneto-elastic coupling, are very similar to the pure magnon case. This provides insights into quasiparticle dynamics in altermagnets and contributes to the broader understanding of many-body interactions in spin-split systems.

The theory reproduces classical time dilation, predicts correlation-dependent deviations from standard evolution, and suggests that non-interacting or massless particles exhibit negligible internal time.

This work introduces a diffusion-based generative framework for linear controller synthesis grounded in the Youla-Kucera parameterization, enabling the construction of stabilizing controllers by design. The diffusion model learns a conditional mapping from plant dynamics and desired performance metrics to feasible Youla parameters, guaranteeing internal stability while flexibly accommodating user-specified targets. Trained on synthetically generated stable SISO plants with fixed-order Youla parameters, the proposed approach reliably synthesizes controllers that meet prescribed sensitivity and settling-time specifications on previously unseen systems. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first demonstration that diffusion models can generate stabilizing controllers, combining rigorous control-theoretic guarantees with the versatility of modern generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Youla\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u95ed\u73af\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u95ed\u73af\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Youla-Kucera\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u5230\u53ef\u884cYoula\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified.

Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field. The latter endows the guiding-center coordinate with a noncommutative structure, converting the periodic potential into a finite dispersion. Finally, we outline how this framework generalizes to multiple quasiholes, enabling a microscopic theory of charged excitations in FQAH systems that retains only the anyon degrees of freedom.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6216Aharonov-Casher\u5e26\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u53cd\u5e38\u970d\u5c14\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u8272\u6563\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u5230Laughlin\u51c6\u7a7a\u7a74\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u51c6\u7a7a\u7a74\u52a8\u91cf\u672c\u5f81\u6001\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u4e2a\u51c6\u7a7a\u7a74\u7684\u8272\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u53cd\u5e38\u970d\u5c14\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u8272\u6563\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u5230Laughlin\u51c6\u7a7a\u7a74\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u51c6\u7a7a\u7a74\u52a8\u91cf\u672c\u5f81\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8272\u6563\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u7a7a\u7a74\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5750\u6807\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u7a7a\u7a74\u5e26\u5bbd\u968fAC\u5e26\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5c4f\u853d\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5927\uff1b\u5728\u626d\u66f2MoTe2\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u7a7a\u7a74\u5e26\u5bbd\u7ea6\u4e3a1 meV\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7531\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u52bf\u548c\u591a\u4f53\u8d1d\u91cc\u76f8\u5171\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8272\u6563\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0FQAH\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u8272\u6563\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u6837\u54c1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5de1\u6e38\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u591a\u51c6\u7a7a\u7a74\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7406\u8bba\u3002"}}

Simulations on electromechanical switching devices show effective tracking of the desired position trajectory using only coil current measurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u5708\u7535\u6d41\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u78c1\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u6216\u4f30\u8ba1\u88ab\u63a7\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u78c1\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u56de\u8def\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7535\u78c1\u673a\u68b0\u5f00\u5173\u88c5\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u5708\u7535\u6d41\u6d4b\u91cf\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8ddf\u8e2a\u671f\u671b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u88ab\u63a7\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Their dynamics consist of discrete random steps, or flights, during which the walker's speed varies deterministically with both the elapsed time and the total duration of the flight. We investigate the anomalous diffusive behavior of VGLWs and analyze it through decomposition into the three fundamental constitutive effects that capture violations of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT): the Joseph effect, reflecting long-range increment correlations, the Noah effect, arising from heavy-tailed step-size distributions with infinite variance, and the Moses effect, associated with statistical aging and non-stationarity. Our results show that anomalous diffusion in VGLWs is typically generated by a nontrivial combination of all three effects, rather than being attributable to a single mechanism. Strikingly, we find that within the VGLW framework the Noah exponent $L$, which quantifies the strength of the Noah effect, is unbounded from above, revealing a richer and more extreme landscape of anomalous diffusion than in previously studied L\u00e9vy-walk-type models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53d8\u901f\u5ea6\u5e7f\u4e49L\u00e9vy\u884c\u8d70\uff08VGLWs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u5e38\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Joseph\u3001Noah\u548cMoses\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5f02\u5e38\u6269\u6563\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793aNoah\u6307\u6570\u65e0\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53cd\u5e38\u6269\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u6b64\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3VGLWs\u4e2d\u53cd\u5e38\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aJoseph\u3001Noah\u548cMoses\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u6548\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0VGLWs\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u5e38\u6269\u6563\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u4e09\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u5171\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\uff1bNoah\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6307\u6570L\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u65e0\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "VGLWs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfL\u00e9vy\u884c\u8d70\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u7684\u53cd\u5e38\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Previous studies have addressed these challenges through adaptive grids, parameter tuning, or hybrid integration with other clustering methods, each of which offers limited robustness. This paper introduces a grid clustering framework that integrates Laplacian-kernel diffusion imputation and origin-constrained connected-component analysis (OC-CCA) on a uniform grid to reconstruct the cluster topology with high accuracy and computational efficiency. During grid construction, an automated preprocessing stage provides data-driven estimates of cell size and density thresholds. The diffusion step then mitigates sparsity and reconstructs missing edge cells without over-smoothing physical gradients, while OC-CCA constrains component growth to physically consistent origins, reducing false merges across narrow gaps. Operating on a fixed-resolution grid with spatial indexing ensures the scaling of O(nlog n). Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and polymer simulation datasets demonstrate that the method correctly manages edges, preserves cluster topology, and avoids spurious connections. Benchmarking on polymer systems across scales (9k, 180k, and 989k atoms) shows that optimal preprocessing, combined with diffusion-based clustering, reproduces atomic-level accuracy and captures physically meaningful morphologies while delivering accelerated computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6838\u6269\u6563\u586b\u8865\u548c\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u8fde\u901a\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u91cd\u5efa\u805a\u7c7b\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u683c\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u3001\u7c97\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u7ec6\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u8fb9\u754c\u6216\u6865\u63a5\u5355\u5143\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6838\u6269\u6563\u586b\u8865\u7a00\u758f\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u8fde\u901a\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff08OC-CCA\uff09\u9650\u5236\u7ec4\u4ef6\u751f\u957f\u6e90\u5934\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8de8\u7a84\u7f1d\u9519\u8bef\u5408\u5e76\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f51\u683c\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5747\u5300\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u5b9e\u73b0O(nlog n)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u7f18\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u805a\u7c7b\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u907f\u514d\u865a\u5047\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\uff089k\u81f3989k\u539f\u5b50\uff09\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Unlike in multilevel modeling where the intraclass correlation (ICC) is routinely manipulated, IRT studies typically treat reliability as an incidental outcome, creating a \"reliability omission\" that obscures the signal-to-noise ratio of generated data. To address this gap, we introduce a principled framework for reliability-targeted simulation, transforming reliability from an implicit by-product into a precise input parameter. We formalize the inverse design problem, solving for a global discrimination scaling factor that uniquely achieves a pre-specified target reliability. Two complementary algorithms are proposed: Empirical Quadrature Calibration (EQC) for rapid, deterministic precision, and Stochastic Approximation Calibration (SAC) for rigorous stochastic estimation. A comprehensive validation study across 960 conditions demonstrates that EQC achieves essentially exact calibration, while SAC remains unbiased across non-normal latent distributions and empirical item pools. Furthermore, we clarify the theoretical distinction between average-information and error-variance-based reliability metrics, showing they require different calibration scales due to Jensen's inequality.

The resulting empirical likelihood-based prediction-powered inference (EPI) estimator is asymptotically normal, has asymptotic variance no larger than the fully supervised estimator, and attains the semiparametric efficiency bound when the auxiliary functions span the predictable component of the supervised score. For hypothesis testing and confidence sets, empirical likelihood ratio statistics admit chi-squared-type limiting distributions. As a by-product, the empirical likelihood weights induce a calibrated empirical distribution that integrates supervised and prediction-based information, enabling estimation and uncertainty quantification for general functionals beyond parameters defined by estimating equations.

While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via \"symmetry topological field theory\" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as \"dual\" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u573a\u8bba\uff08SymTFT\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e00\u7ef4\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684Floquet\u591a\u4f53\u5c40\u57df\u5316\uff08MBL\uff09\u76f8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7684Floquet\u76f8\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u2018\u5bf9\u5076\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u2019\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u539f\u6709\u76f8\u7684\u4f53\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684Floquet MBL\u76f8\u5206\u7c7b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u53d7\u9759\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dSymTFT\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684Floquet MBL\u76f8\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528SymTFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c061D G-\u5bf9\u79f0Floquet MBL\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5e94\u5230G\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u53cc\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5b50\u7fa4\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u626d\u66f2\u91cf\u5b50\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5bf9\u79f0\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5df2\u77e5\u7684Floquet MBL\u76f8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u2018\u5bf9\u5076\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u2019\u76f8\u53ca\u5176\u4f53\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u76f8\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u4e0e\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u7531\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u79f0\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7edd\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5f00\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u7684\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SymTFT\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5206\u7c7bFloquet\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u76f8\u548c\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u666e\u9002\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u5728\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u5947\u7269\u6001\u3002"}}

Main contributions are open-source software code: A hybrid approach mixing \"traditional\" nonconvex and convex methods can make difficult problems more accessible. A demonstration of how to efficiently implement such an algorithm, avoiding interfacial bottlenecks, is provided, finding optimal protocols to establish entanglement through a lossy channel. The central software package developed addresses polynomial optimization problems. Many problems naturally involve only a polynomial objective and constraint polynomials. Such problems can automatically be cast into semidefinite programs that provide a hierarchy of outer approximations. The resulting problems are often so large and scale so unfavorably with respect to the variable number and degree involved that the boundary of the doable is reached quickly. However, technical progress both in hardware and algorithms has pushed this boundary - but software frameworks for polynomial optimization have not followed in the same manner, often now making them the bottleneck that before was the solver. The package PolynomialOptimization.jl developed during this thesis aims to fill the gap and provide a very resource-efficient intermediate layer together with a wide number of algorithms to reduce the problem size, and naturally supporting complex numbers and semidefinite constraints ubiquitous in quantum information problems. Its application on an entanglement distribution problem is demonstrated, showing that even relaxations with semidefinite matrices of three- and four-digit size can be solved conveniently. Finally, a new way to calculate interior-point barriers for the cone of sums-of-squares matrices in a nearly time-optimal way is developed, whose efficient implementation has the potential of further reducing resource consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6PolynomialOptimization.jl\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51f8\u4e0e\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\u5206\u53d1\u534f\u8bae\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u8ddf\u4e0a\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7b49\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6570\u548c\u534a\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u51f8\u4e0e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8f6f\u4ef6PolynomialOptimization.jl\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u964d\u7ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u90e8\u70b9\u6cd5\u7684\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4f4d\u6570\u81f3\u56db\u4f4d\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u534a\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\u901a\u8fc7\u635f\u8017\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u53d1\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "PolynomialOptimization.jl\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u72b6\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6270\u52a8\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u8865\u507f\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7387\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff08ADP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u72b6\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\uff08ESO\uff09\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u590d\u5408\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff08ETM\uff09\u4ec5\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5f3a\u6270\u52a8\u6291\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u89e6\u53d1ADP\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u5177\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u878d\u5408RL\u3001ESO\u4e0eETM\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The benchmark is built upon a high-fidelity, experimentally calibrated dynamic model that captures the strongly coupled thermal, physicochemical, and biological processes governing industrial-scale open raceway ponds. A closed-loop simulation environment is provided, featuring realistic actuator constraints, gas transport delays, stiff integration, and a fully specified scenario based on multi-day outdoor disturbances (irradiance, temperature, wind, and humidity). Four user-replaceable controllers define the manipulation of CO2 injection, air bubbling, harvest/dilution sequencing, and heat-exchanger operation. The platform computes a unified global performance index, in addition to individual metrics for each control problem, combining tracking error, gas and energy usage, and biomass productivity, enabling consistent and quantitative comparison of alternative control strategies. Baseline regulatory architectures (On/Off, PI/PID, and Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC)) are included to illustrate the benchmark use for classical and advanced control methods.

Grebenkov"], "title": "Correlation between the first-reaction time and the acquired boundary local time", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate the statistical correlation between the first-reaction time of a diffusing particle and its boundary local time accumulated until the reaction event. Since the reaction event occurs after multiple encounters of the particle with a partially reactive boundary, the boundary local time as a proxy for the number of such encounters is not independent of, but intrinsically linked to, the first-reaction time. We propose a universal theoretical framework to derive their joint probability density and, in particular, the correlation coefficient.

This market consists of a cartel with market power and a fringe consisting of many small firms, whose deposits are interrelated. In addition, the firms face constraints on extraction. Besides the nonrenewable resource, there is also its sustainable substitute, which constrains the price. We fully characterize the resulting Stackelberg equilibrium. Besides typical solution, in which initially the cartel and fringe extract simultaneously, we find that for some model parameters and initial capacities, the cartel may also deter the fringe from extraction, or it may refrain from extraction until the fringe depletes their deposit.

While transformers have shown promise in various control applications due to sequential modeling through self-attention mechanisms, they have not been used within adaptive control architectures that provide stability guarantees. Existing transformer-based approaches for control rely on offline training with fixed weights, resulting in open-loop implementations that lack real-time adaptation capabilities and stability assurances. To address these limitations, a continuous LyAT controller is developed that adaptively estimates drift and diffusion uncertainties in stochastic dynamical systems without requiring offline pre-training. A key innovation is the analytically derived adaptation law constructed from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, which enables real-time weight updates while guaranteeing probabilistic uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking and parameter estimation errors. Experimental validation on a quadrotor demonstrates the performance of the developed controller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Transformer\uff08LyAT\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u79bb\u7ebf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u7684LyAT\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u968f\u673a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u6269\u6563\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e00\u81f4\u6700\u7ec8\u6709\u754c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LyAT\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Transformer\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u968f\u673a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Analyzing the collective dynamics that emerge during evacuation processes requires simulation tools capable of capturing individual interactions and spatial constraints realistically.\n  In this work, we present \\textit{SiCoBioNa}, an open-source evacuation simulator based on the Social Force Model (SFM). The software provides an intuitive graphical interface that allows users to configure pedestrian properties, spatial geometries, and initial conditions without requiring prior expertise in numerical modeling techniques. The SFM framework enables the representation of goal-oriented motion, interpersonal interactions, and interactions with fixed obstacles.\n  The simulator generates both quantitative data and visual outputs, facilitating the analysis of evacuation dynamics and the evaluation of different spatial configurations.

We develop an integrated approach that consistently enhances the handling of risk in market volatility forecasting, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring. Our probabilistic, interpretable models deliver reliable results: We evaluate the performance of one-day-ahead 95% Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts on daily S&P 500 returns, with a training period from 2000 to 2019 and an out-of-sample test period spanning 2020 to 2024. Formal tests of unconditional (Kupiec) and conditional (Christoffersen) coverage reveal that an LSTM baseline achieves near-nominal calibration. In contrast, a GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t innovations underestimates tail risk. Our proposed discount-factor DLM model produces a slightly liberal VaR estimate, with evidence of clustered violations. Bayesian logistic regression improves recall and AUC-ROC for fraud detection, and a hierarchical Beta state-space model provides transparent and adaptive compliance risk assessment. The pipeline is distinguished by precise uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and GPU-accelerated analysis, delivering up to 50x speedup. Remaining challenges include sparse fraud data and proxy compliance labels, but the framework enables actionable risk insights.

While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u6ede\u8026\u5408\u7684Kuramoto\u632f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u548c\u4e09\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7b80\u5316\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u91cd\u73b0\u539f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u96c6\u4f53\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9ad8\u9636\uff08\u591a\u4f53\uff09\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u76f8\u5173\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4ecd\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5e38\u89c1\u65f6\u6ede\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u65f6\u6ede\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u9636\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u542b\u65f6\u6ede\u4f46\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4f53\u548c\u4e09\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6709\u6548Kuramoto\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0eOtt-Antonsen ansatz\u5206\u6790\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5316\u540e\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u539f\u6709\u65f6\u6ede\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u8f6c\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u4e0e\u540c\u6b65\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7b49\u6548\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Nodes take values $\\pm 1$ and update their states at each discrete time step to align with the majority of their neighbors. Using the backtracking dynamical cavity method (BDCM), we estimate the minimal fraction of initial $+1$ nodes required to achieve a $+1$ consensus in $p$ time steps. Our analysis predicts that for $d\\geq4$ an initial global minority of $+1$ nodes is sufficient to quickly steer the entire system toward consensus on $+1$.\n  We then investigate whether such initial conditions can be determined explicitly for a given large random regular graph. To this end, we introduce a new algorithm, which we name history-passing reinforcement (HPR), designed to find such initial configurations with a minority of $+1$ nodes. We find, as a main result, that the HPR algorithm finds initial configurations where the minority takes over the majority for $d$-regular random graphs with $d\\geq4$.\n  The HPR algorithm outperforms standard simulated annealing-based methods, but does not reach the lowest densities predicted by the BDCM. Rather, the lowest density achievable by the algorithm is near the onset of a dynamical one-step replica symmetry breaking (d1RSB) phase, which we estimate using a one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) formulation of the BDCM. While we focus on the majority dynamics and random $d$-regular graphs, the algorithm can be extended to other dynamical rules and classes of sparse graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u968f\u673ad-\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u591a\u6570\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6240\u9700\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5386\u53f2\u4f20\u9012\u5f3a\u5316\uff08HPR\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5bfb\u627e\u5c11\u6570\u8282\u70b9\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u504f\u5dee\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u4e3a\u5c11\u6570\u7684+1\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u5426\u5feb\u901f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u6210+1\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u6eaf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7a7a\u8154\u6cd5\uff08BDCM\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728p\u6b65\u5185\u8fbe\u5230+1\u5171\u8bc6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c11\u521d\u59cb+1\u8282\u70b9\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faHPR\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u5bfb\u627e\u6b64\u7c7b\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8ed\u22654\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5168\u5c40\u5c11\u6570+1\u8282\u70b9\u8db3\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u6210+1\u5171\u8bc6\uff1bHPR\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u5c11\u6570\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u8fbe\u5230BDCM\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u52a8\u6001\u5355\u6b65\u526f\u672c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u7f3a\uff08d1RSB\uff09\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "HPR\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728d\u22654\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\u4e2d\u5c11\u6570\u8282\u70b9\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86d1RSB\u76f8\u53d8\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

To design frequentist studies that leverage robust analysis methods, suitable sample sizes to achieve desired power are often found by estimating sampling distributions of p-values via intensive simulation. Moreover, most sample size recommendations rely heavily on assumptions about a single data-generating process. Consequently, robustness in data analysis does not by itself imply robustness in study design, as examining sample size sensitivity to data-generating assumptions typically requires further simulations. We propose an economical alternative for determining sample sizes that are robust to multiple data-generating mechanisms. Applying our theoretical results that model p-values as a function of the sample size, we assess power across the sample size space using simulations conducted at only two sample sizes for each data-generating mechanism.

Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have imaged the density-driven melting of generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) and Mott insulators (MIs) in electron-doped, near-60\u00b0 twisted MoSe2 bilayers featuring a triangular moir\u00e9 superlattice. We observe striking electron-hole asymmetry in GWC melting: hole-doped GWCs yield interaction-driven disordered states whereas electron-doped GWCs melt into delocalized liquid-like states. This asymmetry arises from the broken particle-hole symmetry of the moir\u00e9 superlattice, which produces electron and hole Fermi pockets with different momentum geometries upon GWC condensation. MI states melt without such asymmetry, consistent with the absence of a symmetry-breaking density modulation. This work provides direct visualization of the novel emergent phases that appear as GWCs undergo quantum melting transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u96a7\u9053\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e86\u8fd160\u00b0\u8f6c\u89d2MoSe2\u53cc\u5c42\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u83ab\u7279\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7194\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7535\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7194\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6469\u5c14\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u83ab\u7279\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5728\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u63ba\u6742\u4e0b\u7684\u7194\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u96a7\u9053\u663e\u5fae\u955c\uff08STM\uff09\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u63ba\u6742\u7684\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u6469\u5c14\u8d85\u6676\u683cMoSe2\u53cc\u5c42\u4f53\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3\u6676\u4f53\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u7a7a\u7a74\u63ba\u6742\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7194\u5316\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u7a7a\u7a74\u63ba\u6742\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u5e8f\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u7535\u5b50\u63ba\u6742\u5f62\u6210\u79bb\u57df\u7684\u7c7b\u6db2\u4f53\u6001\uff1b\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6e90\u4e8e\u6469\u5c14\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u7a7a\u7a74\u8d39\u7c73\u53e3\u888b\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u51e0\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u83ab\u7279\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7194\u5316\u5219\u65e0\u6b64\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6469\u5c14\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7c92\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7834\u7f3a\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3\u6676\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7194\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

Here, we consider models with $N$ fermionic modes in which each participates in at most a constant number $d$ of interactions and study the circuit depth required to implement the Trotterized time evolution on qubit hardware with all-to-all connectivity. We introduce an encoding that augments each physical fermionic mode with a small number of auxiliary fermions, enabling the removal of Jordan--Wigner strings. Although the preparation of the auxiliary fermion state incurs an initial overhead, this state remains invariant under time evolution. As a result, long-time evolution can be implemented with asymptotically optimal circuit depth, reducing a previously multiplicative $O(\\log N)$ overhead to an additive overhead. Our results thus establish that the simulation of sparse fermionic models on qubit hardware matches the performance achievable on ideal fermionic hardware up to constant factors and $O(dN)$ ancillary qubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6d88\u9664Jordan-Wigner\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u8d39\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4e\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8d39\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u4e58\u6027\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u8d39\u7c73\u6a21\u5f0f\u6dfb\u52a0\u5c11\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6765\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u5904\u7406Jordan-Wigner\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u539f\u672cO(log N)\u7684\u4e58\u6027\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4e3a\u52a0\u6027\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u8d39\u7c73\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7a00\u758f\u8d39\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u8d39\u7c73\u786c\u4ef6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u548cO(dN)\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3002"}}

We then investigate conditions on the mapping $F(\\cdot)$ and its Jacobian that imply the full rank condition for the generalized Jacobian, such as the uniform P-function and the uniform P-matrix condition. Subsequently, we focus on VIs arising from games and interpret our main result in a game setting. Based on the P$_\u03a5$-matrix condition, we provide a sufficient condition for a game to have a Nash equilibrium.

Specifically, the estimation is performed first on a user group basis and then at the individual user level with reduced complexity and latency.We also develop a nonlinear iterative multi-user detection (MUD) algorithm that utilizes a detection window for each user to identify interfering symbols and estimate MUI on a slot-by-slot basis, followed by maximum \\textit{a-posteriori} probability detection of user signals.Simulations demonstrate that our scheme achieves bit error rates comparable to scenarios with transmission delays known and signal detection perfectly synchronized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u6388\u6743\u3001\u591a\u7528\u6237\u6c34\u4e0b\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u5149\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u591a\u7528\u6237\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6cca\u677e\u6563\u7c92\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6cca\u677e\u6563\u7c92\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c34\u4e0b\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570OWC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u5e27\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u7528\u6237\u7ec4\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u4e24\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fed\u4ee3\u591a\u7528\u6237\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08MUD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9010\u65f6\u9699\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u6270\u7b26\u53f7\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u540c\u6b65\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6c34\u4e0bPhC OWC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7531\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f02\u6b65MUI\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7528\u6237\u3001\u65e0\u6388\u6743\u63a5\u5165\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Seedlings of negligible size are introduced at random positions in a field, grow at a prescribed rate, and are harvested upon reaching a fixed maturity diameter. Planting attempts that would lead to an overlap at any time during growth are rejected. Starting from an empty field, this simple dynamical rule drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state in which the mean planting and harvesting rates coincide. We show that the steady state can be mapped onto a nonadditive polydisperse hard-disk fluid and exploit this mapping to develop analytical predictions based on a low-density virial expansion and on scaled particle theory. The resulting description yields an effective adsorption isotherm for the steady-state plant density as a function of the planting rate and compares favorably with numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. At large planting rates, the density approaches the optimal value achieved by desynchronized regular planting, and the data are consistent with an algebraic approach to this limit with an exponent close to 1/3. Beyond density and yield, we show that the spatial organization of the field at high planting rates exhibits clear signatures of the same underlying geometric constraints that characterize optimal desynchronized planting. This connection is revealed through both the conventional radial distribution function and a radius-resolved pair correlation g(z,r) which highlights strong size correlations associated with parent-child seeding events and whose structure can be interpreted as a dynamically broadened precursor of the corresponding ideal mixe--size lattice. Finally, we extend the theory to sigmoidal growth laws and compute the associated virial coefficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u957f\u786c\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u975e\u52a0\u6027\u591a\u5206\u6563\u786c\u789f\u6d41\u4f53\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ef4\u91cc\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u6807\u5ea6\u7c92\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u6001\u690d\u7269\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u690d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u79cd\u690d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u975e\u52a0\u6027\u591a\u5206\u6563\u786c\u789f\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ef4\u91cc\u5c55\u5f00\u4e0e\u6807\u5ea6\u7c92\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u968f\u79cd\u690d\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5438\u9644\u7b49\u6e29\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u79cd\u690d\u7387\u4e0b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8d8b\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4ee5\u7ea61/3\u6307\u6570\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u5f0f\u903c\u8fd1\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u53cd\u6620\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f84\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u534a\u5f84\u5206\u8fa8\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eb2\u4ee3-\u5b50\u4ee3\u64ad\u79cd\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u690d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u79cd\u690d\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3S\u578b\u751f\u957f\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Questions about finite time dynamics (evolution) were always considered as, although important for practical applications, but untreatable rigorously (mathematically). The same attitude was in the theory of strongly chaotic dynamical systems, which evolve similarly to stochastic processes. However, a natural question on dependence of the process of escape on a position of a \"hole\" in the state (phase) space, which was never asked in mathematical theory of open dynamical systems, opened up a new direction of research, which was dealing with finite time predictions of evolutions of such systems. It turned out, that transport of orbits in the phase space of the \"most strongly chaotic\" dynamical systems has three different stages. In the first stage there is a hierarchy of the first hitting probabilities, that shows which parts of the phase space the orbits of a system, which is an equilibrium state, will be more likely to visit the first. A principal (and the most important for applications) question was how the length of this interval changes with more refinement observations of the positions of the orbits in the phase space. Surprisingly, it turned out that the length of the time interval, where finite time predictions are possible, increases (rather to be shrinking), which, at the first sight, seems to be natural. However, this increase of the length of the time interval, where finite time predictions are possible, was rather slow (just linear) with respect to the growth of precision (partition of the phase space) of observations. In the present paper it is proved (by totally different technique) that this growth is actually exponential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f68\u9053\u5728\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u533a\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\u968f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u8bba\u548c\u5f3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\u95f4\u6781\u9650\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u5b66\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u5b54\u6d1e\u2019\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u9003\u9038\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u653e\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u51fb\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u957f\u5ea6\u968f\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5bf9\u5f3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d9\u4e8b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b87\u5b99\u4ece\u5927\u7206\u70b8\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5171\u901a\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u6253\u7834\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u53d8\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fde\u7eed\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u5b87\u5b99\u7ed3\u6784\u5230\u751f\u547d\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5982\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5c94\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u548c\u5728\u6d4b\u5ea6\u96f6\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u53ef\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u81ea\u8eab\u672a\u6765\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

These systems show unpredictable behaviour due to dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty across spatiotemporal scales. Despite growing interest, few studies systematically integrate both concepts when assessing resilience. This paper conducts an integrative review of 102 English-language publications to identify gaps in current approaches. Findings reveal that most papers address lower levels of uncertainty and rarely consider dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty simultaneously, which limits the effectiveness of resilience strategies. To advance systems research, we propose a conceptual framework and practical tools to support researchers and decision-makers in evaluating and improving resilience.

However, a systematic picture for the solvability of multi-unitary dynamics remains missing. We present a framework encompassing a large class of such non-integrable models with exactly solvable dynamics, which we term \\emph{completely reducible} circuits. In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant. Building on these results, we propose that in general non-integrable dynamics the curvature of the entanglement line tension can be interpreted as a density of information transport.

The problem is formulated as a distributed online optimization problem in a multi-agent system. At each time step, each agent only observes its own instantaneous objective function and local inequality constraints; agents make decisions online and cooperate to minimize the sum of the time-varying objectives while satisfying the global coupled constraints. To solve the problem, we propose an algorithm based on the primal-dual approach combined with constraint-tracking. Under appropriate assumptions that the objective and constraint functions are convex, their gradients are uniformly bounded, and the path length of the optimal solution sequence grows sublinearly, we analyze theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm and prove that both the dynamic regret and the constraint violation are sublinear with time horizon T. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a time-varying economic dispatch problem in power systems using both synthetic data and Australian Energy Market data. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in terms of tracking performance, constraint satisfaction, and adaptation to time-varying disturbances, thereby providing a practical and theoretically well-supported solution for real-time distributed economic dispatch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u53d8\u8026\u5408\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u53d8\u8026\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5728\u7ebf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u53d8\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u548c\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u5168\u5c40\u8026\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51f8\u6027\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u6709\u754c\u6027\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u72af\u5747\u4e3a\u5173\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4T\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u5145\u5206\u4e14\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u8026\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Among them, the 3-SAT problem is prominent due to its NP-complete nature. In physics terms, its solution corresponds to finding the ground state of a disordered Ising spin Hamiltonian with third-order, or tensor, interactions. The large growth of the number of third-order interactions with number of variables poses technical difficulties for the physical implementation of minimizers. Therefore, researchers have proposed quadratization techniques which reduce the order of the system, however, at the cost of including additional degrees of freedom. Their inclusion induces a drastic slow down in the minimization, which makes such procedures technically infeasible for large problems. In this work, we take a physics approach by employing the renormalization group to create a pairwise interacting system from the original third-order system while preserving the free energy. Our procedure utilizes additional degrees of freedom that exhibit an independent dynamics provided the original degrees of freedom are fixed. A step-wise trace of the extra variables while running the minimization is therefore theoretically manageable, yielding a state-dependent effective interaction. We use the effective interaction to reconstruct the original third-order energy spectrum, as this yields equal scaling of computations-to-ground-state compared to the original tensor formulation. Here, the original degrees of freedom interact with a subsystem that appears to be in a superposition of an exponentially large number of states. In the zero-temperature limit, the superposition concentrates on one state. Our spectrum-engineering techniques reveal new routes toward the ground state of disordered Ising systems, through Markov chains, and allow for efficient technological implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5177\u6709\u4e09\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u76843-SAT\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u6b21\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97 slowdown\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5f20\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "3-SAT \u95ee\u9898\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u4e09\u9636\u5f20\u91cf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u5e8fIsing\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u968f\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u6025\u5267\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7ed9\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e26\u6765\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u964d\u9636\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u989d\u5916\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u964d\u9636\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u989d\u5916\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5728\u539f\u53d8\u91cf\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6709\u6548\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u6784\u539f\u59cb\u4e09\u9636\u80fd\u91cf\u8c31\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5f20\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u6b21\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5728\u96f6\u6e29\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u770b\u4f3c\u5904\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u72b6\u6001\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8c31\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u5bfb\u627e\u65e0\u5e8fIsing\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u9636\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent repulsive priors improve parsimony in density mixtures by discouraging nearby components, but their direct extension to regression is nontrivial since separation must respect the predictive geometry induced by covariates. We propose a repulsive g-prior for regression mixtures that enforces separation in the Mahalanobis metric, penalizing components indistinguishable in the predictive mean space. This construction preserves conjugacy-like updates while introducing geometry-aware interactions, enabling efficient blocked-collapsed Gibbs sampling. Theoretically, we establish tractable normalizing bounds, posterior contraction rates, and shrinkage of tail mass on the number of components.

By introducing the Hamiltonian system and extending the gradient descent method to a Hilbert space, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control under the uniform convexity condition. The regularity of the solution to the Hamiltonian system is obtained, including the derivatives with respect to the initial state and the Malliavin derivatives. The connection between the Hamiltonian system and the value function is subsequently proven, enabling us to derive regularity properties of the value function via probabilistic techniques. Finally, by the dynamic programming principle, the value function is verified to be the unique classical solution to the HJB equation and the optimal feedback control is provided.

The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC through power flow analysis. The capacity must be sufficient to charge passive components such as transmission lines and transformers, provide rotor excitation, and supply wind turbine (WT) and electrolyzer (ELZ) auxiliaries during startup. The proposed system integrates wind-hydrogen coordinated control (WHCC) and hydrogen-storage coordinated control (HSCC). Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system.

Fractional Brownian surfaces give an idealized self-affine model of Earth's relief with one parameter, the Hurst exponent $H$, characterizing the roughness of the surface. To quantitatively assess agreement with Earth elevation data, we compile a large dataset of topographic profiles of islands (N=131,063 with the range of areas covering 8+ orders of magnitude) and obtain four estimates for the Hurst exponent of Earth's surface by fitting four statistical laws from the theory of self-affine surfaces concerning islands: (i) distribution of areas, (ii) volume-area relationship, (iii) perimeter-area relationship, and (iv) maximum height-area relationship. The estimated Hurst exponents differ greatly, indicating different fractal scaling behavior for different geometric features, but are sorted in order of increasing expected influence of erosion at the shorelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5927\u91cf\u5c9b\u5c7f\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5730\u7403\u8868\u9762\u7684\u81ea\u4eff\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\u4f30\u8ba1Hurst\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u5f62\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5730\u7403\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u81ea\u4eff\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u8c8c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u5f62\u7279\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc713\u4e07\u4e2a\u5c9b\u5c7f\u7684\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u56db\u79cd\u5173\u4e8e\u5c9b\u5c7f\u7684\u81ea\u4eff\u5c04\u8868\u9762\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1a\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u4f53\u79ef-\u9762\u79ef\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5468\u957f-\u9762\u79ef\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6700\u5927\u9ad8\u5ea6-\u9762\u79ef\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f30\u8ba1Hurst\u6307\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684Hurst\u6307\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u5f62\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6d77\u5cb8\u7ebf\u4fb5\u8680\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5730\u7403\u8868\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u8c8c\u7279\u5f81\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5404\u5f02\u7684\u5206\u5f62\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5176\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u4fb5\u8680\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This study presents a first attempt to develop a bottom-up regional building energy model based on prototype buildings simulated in EnergyPlus, to assess space heating and cooling loads of urban and rural residential buildings across 30 Chinese provinces from 1980 to 2024. The results indicate that: (1) Guangdong recorded the highest cooling loads in 2020, reaching 76.5 TWh/a in urban areas and 63.0 TWh/a in rural areas; Henan exhibited the highest rural heating load at 174.6 TWh/a, while urban heating loads were highest in provinces such as Liaoning and Shandong. (2) From 1980 to 2024, average cooling loads increased from 12.4 to 15.1 kWh/m2/a in urban areas but declined from 22.63 to 19.87 kWh/m2/a in rural areas. Over the same period, average heating loads decreased from 44.08 to 39.92 kWh/m2/a in urban areas and from 100.15 to 72.42 kWh/m2/a in rural areas. (3) Urban residential building stock has surpassed rural stock in 22 provinces in recent years, compared with only 4 provinces in 2000, and the presence of 12 urban energy-efficiency standards versus only one rural standard further highlights substantial envelope performance gaps. Collectively, these dynamics have led to pronounced and persistent urban-rural disparities in residential heating and cooling loads. These findings underscore the need for differentiated standards and region-specific clean heating strategies, while providing a transferable modeling framework to inform targeted energy-saving policies and support the building sector's transition toward carbon neutrality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u57fa\u4e8eEnergyPlus\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5178\u578b\u5efa\u7b51\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u8017\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e861980\u81f32024\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd30\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd\u57ce\u4e61\u4f4f\u5b85\u7684\u91c7\u6696\u4e0e\u5236\u51b7\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u57ce\u4e61\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u5236\u5b9a\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u80fd\u6548\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u533a\u57df\u6e05\u6d01\u4f9b\u6696\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5efa\u7b51\u90e8\u95e8\u78b3\u4e2d\u548c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f4f\u5b85\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6696\u4e0e\u5236\u51b7\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u57ce\u4e61\u4e4b\u95f4\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5404\u7701\u4efd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u539f\u578b\u5efa\u7b51\uff0c\u5728EnergyPlus\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5efa\u7b51\u5b58\u91cf\u548c\u56f4\u62a4\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f30\u7b971980\u20132024\u5e7430\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd\u57ce\u4e61\u4f4f\u5b85\u7684\u91c7\u6696\u4e0e\u5236\u51b7\u8d1f\u8377\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u4e1c\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u519c\u6751\u5236\u51b7\u8d1f\u8377\u6700\u9ad8\uff082020\u5e74\u5206\u522b\u4e3a76.5\u548c63.0 TWh/a\uff09\uff0c\u6cb3\u5357\u519c\u6751\u91c7\u6696\u8d1f\u8377\u6700\u9ad8\uff08174.6 TWh/a\uff09\uff0c\u8fbd\u5b81\u548c\u5c71\u4e1c\u57ce\u5e02\u91c7\u6696\u8d1f\u8377\u8f83\u9ad8\uff1b1980\u20132024\u5e74\u57ce\u4e61\u91c7\u6696\u8d1f\u8377\u5747\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u5236\u51b7\u8d1f\u8377\u4e0a\u5347\u800c\u519c\u6751\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8fd1\u5e74\u676522\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd\u57ce\u5e02\u4f4f\u5b85\u5b58\u91cf\u5df2\u8d85\u8fc7\u519c\u6751\uff0c\u4e14\u57ce\u5e02\u670912\u9879\u80fd\u6548\u6807\u51c6\u800c\u519c\u6751\u4ec51\u9879\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u56f4\u62a4\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u57ce\u4e61\u4f4f\u5b85\u91c7\u6696\u5236\u51b7\u8d1f\u8377\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5efa\u7b51\u5b58\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5236\u5b9a\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u3001\u533a\u57df\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u6e05\u6d01\u4f9b\u6696\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e3a\u5efa\u7b51\u9886\u57df\u8282\u80fd\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u78b3\u4e2d\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, these models rely on a shared baseline hazard, which, when specified parametrically, can only capture limited shapes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a general class of parametric survival regression models obtained by modelling the hazard function using autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Covariate information is incorporated via transformed linear predictors on the parameters of the ODE system. Our framework capitalises on the interpretability of parameters in common ODE systems, enabling the identification of covariate values that produce qualitatively distinct hazard shapes associated with different attractors of the system of ODEs. This provides deeper insights into how covariates influence survival dynamics. We develop efficient Bayesian computational tools, including parallelised evaluation of the log-posterior, which facilitates integration with general-purpose Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. We also derive conditions for posterior asymptotic normality, enabling fast approximations of the posterior. A central contribution of our work lies in the case studies. We demonstrate the methodology using clinical trial data with crossing survival curves, and a study of cancer recurrence times where our approach reveals how the efficacy of interventions (treatments) on hazard and survival are influenced by patient characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08ODE\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u751f\u5b58\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5165ODE\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u5efa\u6a21\u98ce\u9669\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u751f\u5b58\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u98ce\u9669\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5f62\u72b6\uff1b\u4e3a\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6cbb\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8eODE\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5bf9\u6570\u540e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408MCMC\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u540e\u9a8c\u6e10\u8fd1\u6b63\u6001\u6027\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u66f2\u7ebf\u5f62\u72b6\uff1b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4ea4\u53c9\u751f\u5b58\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u764c\u75c7\u590d\u53d1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ODE-based\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u751f\u5b58\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

We show that a single, synthetically plausible organic one-dimensional chain, tunable via chemical modification of its radical sites, hosts two such phases: an odd-Haldane phase of a dimerized $S=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain and a Haldane phase of an $S=1$ chain realized when Hund coupling locks two $S=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ spins per monomer into $S=1$. Density-functional theory places the active manifold deep in the Mott regime ($U/t\\!\\approx\\!126$), justifying a spin-only Heisenberg description; a compact $(t,U)\\!\\to\\!J$ mapping then fixes exchange couplings.

Fewer such examples are available when the function to minimize is non-convex. In several cases, discrepancies arise between the existing discrete-time results, namely those obtained for momentum algorithms, and their continuous-time counterparts, with the latter typically yielding stronger guarantees. We argue that the continuized framework (Even et al., 2021), mixing continuous and discrete components, can tighten the gap between known continuous and discrete results. This framework relies on computations akin to standard Lyapunov analyses, from which are deduced convergence bounds for an algorithm that can be written as a Nesterov momentum algorithm with stochastic parameters. In this work, we extend the range of applicability of the continuized framework, e.g. by allowing it to handle non-smooth Lyapunov functions. We then strengthen its trajectory-wise guarantees for linear convergence rate, deriving finite time bounds with high probability and asymptotic almost sure bounds. We apply this framework to the non-convex class of strongly quasar convex functions. Adapting continuous-time results that have weaker discrete equivalents to the continuized method, we improve by a constant factor the known convergence rate, and relax the existing assumptions on the set of minimizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86continuized\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5149\u6ed1Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5f3a\u62df\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u653e\u677e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u96c6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u91cf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u901a\u5e38\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86continuized\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u6df7\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\uff09\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5149\u6ed1Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u754c\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u62df\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u63d0\u5347\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u653e\u677e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7387\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "continuized\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u6790\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u91cf\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we uncover a universal mechanism for realizing maximal entanglement swapping in fermionic Gaussian states subjected to projective Bell measurements. We consider two initially decoupled, half-filled copies of a free-fermion system in arbitrary dimensions and perform post-selective Bell measurements on half of the corresponding sites across the two copies. Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks.

To compare the results with a typical parametric approach of extrapolation and observed survival from a later datacut.\n  Methods Data were pooled from three phase I/II open-label trials evaluating larotrectinib in 196 patients with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase fusion-positive (NTRK+) solid tumours followed up until July 2021. Bayesian joint modelling was used to obtain patient-specific predictions of OS using individual-level sum of diameter of target lesions (SLD) profiles up to the time at which the patient died or was censored. Overall and tumour site-specific estimates were produced, assuming a common, exchangeable, or independent association structure across tumour sites.\n  Results The overall risk of mortality was 9% higher per 10mm increase in SLD (HR 1.09, 95% CrI 1.05 to 1.14) for all tumour sites combined. Tumour-specific point estimates of restricted mean , median and landmark survival were more similar across models for larger tumour groups, compared to smaller tumour groups. In general, parameters were estimated with more certainty compared to a standard Weibull model and were aligned with the more recent datacut.\n  Conclusions Joint modelling using intermediate outcomes such as tumour burden can offer an alternative approach to traditional survival modelling and may improve survival predictions from limited follow-up data. This approach allows complex hierarchical data structures, such as patients nested within tumour types, and can also incorporate multiple longitudinal biomarkers in a multivariate modelling framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u671f\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff08\u5982\u80bf\u7624\u76f4\u5f84\u603b\u548c\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u8425\u517b\u6027\u916a\u6c28\u9178\u6fc0\u9176\u878d\u5408\u9633\u6027\u5b9e\u4f53\u7624\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u751f\u5b58\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u968f\u8bbf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u5b58\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u603b\u4f53\u751f\u5b58\u671f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff08\u5982\u80bf\u7624\u8d1f\u8377\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9879I/II\u671f\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684196\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u4e2a\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u76f4\u5f84\u603b\u548c\uff08SLD\uff09\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u603b\u4f53\u751f\u5b58\u671f\uff1b\u5e76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6Weibull\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u53ca\u6309\u80bf\u7624\u90e8\u4f4d\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u5173\u8054\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6bcf\u589e\u52a010mm SLD\uff0c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u98ce\u9669\u6574\u4f53\u589e\u52a09%\uff08HR 1.09\uff0c95% CrI 1.05\u20131.14\uff09\uff1b\u4e0eWeibull\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u540e\u671f\u6570\u636ecut\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u80bf\u7624\u7ec4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u5c40\uff08\u5982\u80bf\u7624\u8d1f\u8377\uff09\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5c42\u6b21\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u7eb5\u5411\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65e9\u671f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The ability to control exchange-coupling within these systems is therefore highly desirable. Here, we use an atomically sharp scanning tunneling microscope probe to vertically manipulate a 2D Mott insulating kagome metal-organic framework (MOF) featuring Kondo-screened local magnetic moments on Ag(111). We show that by controlling the adsorption height of the MOF, we can also controllably and reversibly change the strength of Kondo coupling between the MOF's local spins and the substrate's conduction electrons.

Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \\(f\\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \\(f\\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a \u0141ojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem.

We develop a unified framework for incorporating a generic quantum resource, including athermality, quantum coherence, and entanglement, into fluctuation theorems. We work within the end point measurement scheme, which avoids an initial energy measurement and allows quantum resources in the initial state to affect nonequilibrium energy statistics. We derive a family of quantum fluctuation theorems, including generalized Jarzynski equalities and Crooks type fluctuation relations, in which corrections decompose into resource resolved contributions. For single systems, we introduce the concept of weight of athermality, and combine it with the weight of coherence to isolate distinct thermodynamic effects of these quantum resources. For bipartite systems, we furthermore obtain two families of entanglement-resolved fluctuation theorems using an appended correlation operator and the best separable approximation, respectively.

The stabilization of most DTC phases is achieved via the disorder-induced many-body localization. In this work, we propose an experimental scheme to realize disorder-free DTCs in a periodically driven Rydberg atom array. Our scheme utilizes a linear potential in the atomic detuning to enhance the DTC order, without being tired to (Stark) many-body localization. We numerically demonstrate that the Stark potential enhances the robustness of the DTC against the flip imperfections and extends its lifetime, which are independent of initial states. Thus, our scheme provides a promising way to explore DTCs in Rydberg atom arrays without disorder averaging and special state preparation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5468\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u539f\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5e8f\u81ea\u7531\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\uff08DTC\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u65af\u5854\u514b\u52bf\u589e\u5f3aDTC\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u9700\u65e0\u5e8f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7684\u7a33\u5b9aDTC\u76f8\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7279\u6b8a\u521d\u6001\u5236\u5907\u548c\u65e0\u5e8f\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u5728\u5468\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u539f\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u65af\u5854\u514b\u52bf\u6765\u589e\u5f3aDTC\u5e8f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65af\u5854\u514b\u52bf\u80fd\u589e\u5f3aDTC\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5ef6\u957f\u5176\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u5728\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u81ea\u7531DTC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Specifically, VQE has achieved great success for ground state calculations of a Hamiltonian. However, excited state calculations arising in quantum chemistry and condensed matter often requires solving more challenging problems than the ground state as these states are generally further away from a mean-field description, and involve less straightforward optimization to avoid the variational collapse to the ground state. Maintaining orthogonality between low-lying eigenstates is a key algorithmic hurdle. In this work, we analyze three VQE models that embed orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost functions, avoiding the need for external enforcement of orthogonality between states. Notably, these formulations possess the desirable property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, helping address optimization difficulties. We conduct rigorous landscape analyses of the models' stationary points and local minimizers, theoretically guaranteeing their favorable properties and providing analytical tools applicable to broader VQE methods. A comprehensive comparison between the three models is also provided, considering their quantum resource requirements and classical optimization complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u6b8a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\u5d4c\u5165\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u672c\u5f81\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08VQE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4e\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u5373\u5168\u5c40\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6001\u901a\u5e38\u8fdc\u79bb\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e14\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5206\u574d\u7f29\u81f3\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684VQE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u522b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u666f\u89c2\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u9a7b\u70b9\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u90fd\u662f\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u8d28\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdbVQE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5206\u6790\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e09\u79cdVQE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728NISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

These conditions are instrumental in analyzing the asymptotic behavior of PWS systems, such as convergence towards an equilibrium point or a limit cycle. The work is motivated by a known principle for contraction analysis of bimodal PWS systems which ensures that the flow dynamics of each mode and the sliding dynamics on the switching manifold are contracting. This approach is extended first to PWS systems with multiple non-intersecting switching manifolds in Rn, and then to two intersecting switching manifolds in R2. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings, along with a discussion on extensions to more general intersecting switching manifolds in Rn.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6bb5\u5149\u6ed1\u7cfb\u7edfFilippov\u89e3\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5df2\u6709\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u975e\u76f8\u4ea4\u53ca\u4e8c\u7ef4\u76f8\u4ea4\u5207\u6362\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4f8b\u5b50\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u53cc\u6a21\u6001PWS\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u5206\u6790\u539f\u7406\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u76f8\u4ea4\u5207\u6362\u6d41\u5f62\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5206\u6790\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eFilippov\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9Rn\u4e2d\u591a\u4e2a\u975e\u76f8\u4ea4\u5207\u6362\u6d41\u5f62\u548cR2\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u4ea4\u5207\u6362\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u5411\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u76f8\u4ea4\u901a\u9053\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001PWS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u975e\u76f8\u4ea4\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u76f8\u4ea4\u5207\u6362\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u6a21\u6001PWS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u6216\u6781\u9650\u73af\u7b49\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

The method augments the Merrimam-Bence-Osher scheme with a pointwise update that enforces the constraint and therefore retains the computational complexity of the original scheme. Remarkably, this naive scheme inherits both crucial structural properties of obstacle mean curvature flow: a geometric comparison principle and a minimizing movements interpretation. The latter immediately implies the unconditional stability of the scheme. Based on the comparison principle we prove the convergence of the scheme to the viscosity solution of obstacle mean curvature flow. Moreover, using the minimizing movements interpretation, we show convergence of a spatially discrete model.

Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings.

Parragh", "Nicolas Dupin", "Jakob Puchinger"], "title": "The Bi-objective Electric Autonomous Dial-a-Ride Problem", "comment": null, "summary": "The electric autonomous dial-a-ride problem (E-ADARP) introduces electric, autonomously driving vehicles and their unique requirements into the classic dial-a-ride problem, where people are transported between pickup and drop-off locations. Next to an electric autonomous vehicle fleet, in the literature, a weighted-sum objective function, which combines the classic routing cost-oriented objective with a user-oriented objective function, has usually been considered. The user-oriented objective function minimizes the total excess user ride time. In this work, we treat them as two separate objective functions, which are optimized concurrently. In order to address the resulting bi-objective E-ADARP, we develop a novel exact framework (called fragment-based checker), whose core part is a smart ``select-and-check\" algorithm that iteratively constructs feasible solutions using fragments. Several enhancements are proposed to enforce the computational efficiency of the proposed method. In the computational experiments, we evaluate several variants of our checker algorithm by leveraging a previously developed branch-and-price algorithm. We benchmark the checker-based framework against state-of-the-art criterion space frameworks as well as a generalized branch-and-price algorithm. Numerical results on both bi-objective DARP and E-ADARP instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. With our proposed approaches, 21 out of 38 instances are solved optimally, where small-to-medium-sized instances are solved within seconds. On larger-scale instances, especially those requiring high battery end levels are computationally challenging to solve, our approaches provide high-quality approximations of the Pareto frontiers.

Yet such transitions also arise in more general settings, including quantum-jump processes with non-Hermitian jump operators, and under inefficient detection. A theoretical framework for treating these broader scenarios has been missing. Here we develop a comprehensive replica Keldysh field theory for general quantum-jump processes in both bosonic and fermionic systems. Our formalism provides a unified description of pure-state quantum trajectories under efficient detection and mixed-state dynamics emerging from inefficient monitoring, with deterministic Lindbladian evolution appearing as a limiting case. It thus establishes a direct connection between phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states of driven open quantum matter and in measurement-induced dynamics. As an application, we study imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting in a one-dimensional lattice system: monitored gain and loss of fermions occurring at different rates, with a fraction of gain and loss jumps undetected. For imbalanced but efficient counting, we recover the qualitative picture of the balanced case: entanglement obeys an area law for any nonzero jump rate, with an extended quantum-critical regime emerging between two parametrically separated length scales. Inefficient detection introduces a finite correlation length beyond which entanglement, as quantified by the fermionic logarithmic negativity, obeys an area law, while the subsystem entropy shows volume-law scaling. Numerical simulations support our analytical findings. Our results offer a general and versatile theoretical foundation for studying measurement-induced phenomena across a wide class of monitored and open quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u91cf\u5b50\u8dc3\u8fc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u590d\u5236Keldysh\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u4f4e\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u6216\u5384\u7c73\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u8dc3\u8fc1\u7b97\u7b26\u548c\u4f4e\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b49\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u60c5\u5f62\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73bb\u8272\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u590d\u5236Keldysh\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u822c\u91cf\u5b50\u8dc3\u8fc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u9762\u79ef\u5f8b\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u533a\uff1b\u4f4e\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u9650\u5173\u8054\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ea0\u7f20\u9075\u5faa\u9762\u79ef\u5f8b\u800c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u71b5\u5448\u73b0\u4f53\u79ef\u5f8b\u6807\u5ea6\u3002\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5404\u7c7b\u88ab\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches for identifying clusters of survival curves often rely on computationally intensive bootstrap techniques to approximate the null hypothesis distribution. While effective, these methods impose significant computational burdens. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages the k-means and log-rank test to efficiently identify and cluster survival curves. Our method eliminates the need for computationally expensive resampling, significantly reducing processing time while maintaining statistical reliability. By systematically evaluating survival curves and determining optimal clusters, the proposed method ensures a practical and scalable alternative for large-scale survival data analysis. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves results comparable to existing bootstrap-based clustering methods while dramatically improving computational efficiency.

Here, we directly visualize the twist-angle-modulated electronic structure of t-BL and twisted double-bilayer (t-DBL) near this critical angle. We find that the moir\u00e9 superlattice not only modifies the relative energy between $\u0393$ and K valleys in t-BL MoTe$_2$, but also strongly reconstructs the $\u0393$ valley for both t-BL and t-DBL. Specifically, the deep $p_z$-derived band at $\u0393$ exhibits a distinct splitting that systematically varies with increasing twist angle. Theoretical analysis suggests that this modulation arises from the twist-angle-dependent lattice relaxation, especially interfacial corrugations. Our work directly visualizes the moir\u00e9-modulated electronic structure and provides key spectroscopic information of lattice relaxation and interlayer interactions underlying the physics of twisted MoTe$_2$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u626d\u89d2\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u63a5\u8fd13.7\u00b0\u5173\u952e\u626d\u89d2\u65f6\u53cc\u5c42\u53ca\u53cc\u53cc\u5c42MoTe\u2082\u4e2d\u83ab\u5c14\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u5bf9\u0393\u548cK\u8c37\u4e4b\u95f4\u80fd\u7ea7\u4ee5\u53ca\u0393\u8c37\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0pz\u8f68\u9053\u884d\u751f\u5e26\u7684\u5206\u88c2\u4e0e\u626d\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6676\u683c\u5f1b\u8c6b\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u626d\u89d2MoTe\u2082\u4e2d\u5173\u8054\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u53cd\u5e38\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u5bf9\u626d\u89d2\u548c\u83ab\u5c14\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u626b\u63cf\u96a7\u9053\u663e\u5fae\u955c/\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u626d\u53cc\u5c42\u548c\u626d\u53cc\u53cc\u5c42MoTe\u2082\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u626d\u89d2\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u968f\u626d\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u83ab\u5c14\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8c03\u8282\u0393\u548cK\u8c37\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f3a\u70c8\u91cd\u6784\u0393\u8c37\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6df1\u57cb\u7684pz\u884d\u751f\u5e26\u51fa\u73b0\u968f\u626d\u89d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u626d\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u754c\u9762\u6676\u683c\u8d77\u4f0f\uff08\u6676\u683c\u5f1b\u8c6b\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u83ab\u5c14\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8c03\u63a7\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6676\u683c\u5f1b\u8c6b\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8c31\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u626d\u89d2MoTe\u2082\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u8054\u7269\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While numerous natural candidates for efficient rules have been eliminated, all existing lower bound constructions are tailored to individual or small sets of pivot rules. We introduce a unified framework for formalizing classes of rules according to the information about the input that they rely on. Within this framework, we show lower bounds for \\emph{ranking-based} classes of rules that base their decisions on orderings of the improving pivot steps induced by the underlying data. Our first result is a superpolynomial lower bound for strategy improvement, obtained via a family of sink parity games, which applies to memory-based generalizations of Bland's rule that only access the input by comparing the ranks of improving edges in some global order. Our second result is a subexponential lower bound for policy iteration, obtained via a family of Markov decision processes, which applies to memoryless rules that only access the input by comparing improving actions according to their ranks in a global order, their reduced costs, and the associated improvements in objective value.

Acedo", "Manuel G. Ortega"], "title": "Economic versus energetic model predictive control of a cold production plant with thermal energy storage", "comment": "14 pages", "summary": "Economic model predictive control has been proposed as a means for solving the unit loading and unit allocation problem in multi-chiller cooling plants. The adjective economic stems from the use of financial cost due to electricity consumption in a time horizon, such is the loss function minimized at each sampling period. The energetic approach is rarely encountered. This article presents for the first time a comparison between the energetic optimization objective and the economic one. The comparison is made on a cooling plant using air-cooled water chillers and a cold storage system. Models developed have been integrated into Simscape, and non-convex mixed optimization methods used to achieve optimal control trajectories for both energetic and economic goals considered separately. The results over several scenarios, and in different seasons, support the consideration of the energetic approach despite the current prevalence of the economic one. The results are dependent on the electric season and the available tariffs. In particular, for the high electric season and considering a representative tariff, the results show that an increment of about 2.15% in energy consumption takes place when using the economic approach instead of the energetic one.

Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice.

Rather than stopping at an abstract optimal measurement, we give a fully constructive solution: an explicit state preparation and an explicit measurement unitary whose computational-basis readout achieves the Helstrom-optimal success probability 3/4 for distinguishing the four possible functions. The resulting circuit is low depth, uses a fixed gate set, and (in this smallest setting) requires no entanglement in the input state. Beyond the specific example, the main message is operational. It highlights a regime in which optimal oracle discrimination is not only well-defined but implementably explicit: the optimal POVM collapses to a compact gate-level primitive that can be compiled, verified, and composed inside larger routines. Motivated by this, we discuss a \"what if\" question that is open in spirit: for fixed (n,m,k), could optimal k-query identification (possibly for large hypothesis classes) admit deterministic, closed-form descriptions of the inter-query unitaries and the final measurement unitary acting on the natural n+m-qubit input--output registers (and, if needed, small work registers)?

A forced-oscillation case study applies a 1 Hz pulsed load (+/- 0.25 p.u.) and shows that the normal-operation shaping filters the oscillation seen by the grid while the UPS-BESS buffers the pulsing component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e2d\u538b\u4e0d\u95f4\u65ad\u7535\u6e90\uff08UPS\uff09\u96c6\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u8fd0\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6545\u969c\u7a7f\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u96f6\u672a\u4f9b\u7535IT\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u7535\u6d41\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7535\u538b\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u9020\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6545\u969c\u671f\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5f31\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u5e76\u7f51\u70b9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684UPS\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u4f9b\u7535\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u652f\u6491\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u6a21\u4e2d\u592e\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6a21\u5f0f1\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8c03\u8282\u76f4\u6d41\u6bcd\u7ebf\u5e76\u6574\u5f62\u7535\u7f51\u53d6\u7535\uff1b\u6a21\u5f0f2\u5728\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9650\u6d41\u3001\u4f18\u5148P-Q\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528UPS-BESS\u50a8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u8fd4\u56de\uff1b\u6a21\u5f0f3\u53ef\u9009\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u5782\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u5e73\u5747dq\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u4e09\u76f8\u77ed\u8def\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u672a\u4f9b\u7535IT\u80fd\u91cf\uff080.00000 MWh vs 0.00208 MWh\uff09\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u9006\u53d8\u7535\u6d41\u964d\u4f4e\u81f30.57 p.u.\uff08\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c61.02 p.u.\uff09\uff0c\u6545\u969c\u671f\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u7535\u7f51\u53d6\u7535\u8fbe0.20 p.u.\uff0cPCC\u7535\u538b\u5728\u4e00\u5468\u6ce2\u5185\u6062\u590d\u81f30.79 p.u.\uff08\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c60.66 p.u.\uff09\uff1b\u57281 Hz\u8109\u51b2\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6ee4\u9664\u7535\u7f51\u4fa7\u7684\u529f\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e2d\u538bUPS\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5728\u6545\u969c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7684\u4f9b\u7535\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u7535\u7f51\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6545\u969c\u7a7f\u8d8a\u3001\u50a8\u80fd\u7f13\u51b2\u548c\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002"}}

This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific \"stabilizer-testing\" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\\mathrm{cl}}^* < 1$, then $p_{\\mathrm{cl}}^* \\leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u503c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e0a\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9GHZ\u3001toric\u7801\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u7c07\u6001\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86 tighter \u4e0a\u754c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5229\u7528\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5faa\u73af\u7c07\u6001\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u7d27\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u9700\u6d4b\u91cf\u6307\u6570\u5c0f\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5373\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u6001\u5728\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9664GHZ\u6001\u5916\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u503c\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0a\u754c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e0a\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5faa\u73af\u7c07\u6001\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u503c\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u503c\u82e5\u5c0f\u4e8e1\u5219\u81f3\u591a\u4e3a7/8\uff1b\u5bf9\u5faa\u73af\u7c07\u6001\u83b7\u5f97\u6e10\u8fd1\u7d27\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6781\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5373\u53ef\u89c1\u8bc1\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u535a\u5f08\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u6001\uff08\u5982\u5faa\u73af\u7c07\u6001\uff09\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5f31\u6d4b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c55\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The latter are found among non-Kramers f electron compounds. Without coupling to the nuclear spins these magnets have a quantum critical point (QCP) separating paramagnetic and induced moment regime. The hyperfine interaction suppresses the QCP and leads to a gradual crossover between induced electronic and nuclear hyperfine coupling dominated magnetic order. It is shown how the critical temperature depends on the electronic and nuclear control parameters including the nuclear spin size and its possible nuclear quadrupole splitting. In particular the dependence of the specific heat on the control parameters and applied field is investigated for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. It is shown that the three peak structure in the electronic induced moment regime gradually changes to a two-peak structure in the hyperfine coupling dominated nuclear moment order regime or for increasing field strength. Most importantly the possibility of a reentrance behaviour of magnetic order or likewise nonmonotonic critical fields due to hyperfine coupling influence is demonstrated. Finally the systematic evolution of the phase diagram under the influence of nuclear quadrupole coupling is clarified.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u514b\u5587\u672bf\u7535\u5b50\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8026\u5408\u548c\u56db\u6781\u5206\u88c2\u5bf9\u5355\u91cd\u6001\u57fa\u6001\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u78c1\u77e9\u5e8f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u5b50\u4e0e\u6838\u78c1\u6709\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6e10\u53d8\u4ea4\u53c9\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6bd4\u70ed\u3001\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u53ca\u76f8\u56fe\u968f\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5916\u573a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u78c1\u5e8f\u518d\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u5355\u91cd\u6001\u57fa\u6001\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u56db\u6781\u5206\u88c2\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u78c1\u77e9\u5e8f\u53ca\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7535\u5b50-\u6838\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8be5\u8026\u5408\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u76f8\u53d8\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8026\u5408\u548c\u6838\u56db\u6781\u5206\u88c2\u5bf9\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u6bd4\u70ed\u968f\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u6838\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u56db\u6781\u5206\u88c2\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u5916\u52a0\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u56fe\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ece\u7535\u5b50\u8bf1\u5bfc\u78c1\u77e9\u5e8f\u5230\u6838\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u78c1\u5e8f\u7684\u6e10\u53d8\u4ea4\u53c9\uff1b\u6bd4\u70ed\u7531\u4e09\u5cf0\u7ed3\u6784\u9010\u6e10\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e24\u5cf0\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8026\u5408\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u78c1\u5e8f\u518d\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u4e34\u754c\u573a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\uff1b\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u6838\u56db\u6781\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u76f8\u56fe\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8026\u5408\u5728\u975eKramers f\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u78c1\u6709\u5e8f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5982\u518d\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u76f8\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6838\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5728\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002"}}

While Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) offers tractable protection via an ambiguity ball around empirical data, choosing the ball radius is delicate: large radii are conservative, small radii risk violation under regime change. We propose a shift-aware Gaussian-supremum (GS) validation framework for Wasserstein-DRO CVaR portfolios, building on the work by Lam and Qian (2019). Phase I of the framework generates a candidate path by solving the exact reformulation of the robust CVaR constraint over a grid of Wasserstein radii. Phase II of the framework learns a target deployment law $Q$ by density-ratio reweighting of a time-ordered validation fold, computes weighted CVaR estimates, and calibrates a simultaneous upper confidence band via a block multiplier bootstrap to account for dependence. We select the least conservative feasible portfolio (or abstain if the effective sample size collapses). Theoretically, we extend the normalized GS validator to non-i.i.d. financial data: under weak dependence and regularity of the weighted scores, any portfolio passing our validator satisfies the CVaR limit under $Q$ with probability at least $1-\u03b2$; the Wasserstein term contributes a deterministic margin $(\u03b4/\u03b1)\\|x\\|_*$.

To protect the output information, which is considered private data and may be at high risk of exposure, Laplace noise is added to the information exchange. The conditions for achieving mean square and almost sure consensus in observer-based MASs are established using the backstepping method and the convergence theory for nonnegative almost supermartingales. It is shown that the separation principle remains valid for the consensus problem of linear MASs with decaying Laplace noise. Furthermore, the convergence rate is provided. Then, a joint design framework is developed for state estimation gain, feedback control gain, and noise to ensure the preservation of \u03b5-differential privacy. The output information of each agent is shown to be protected at every time step.

Fitting mixture models usually requires large sample sizes and combining data from multiple sites can be beneficial. However, sharing individual participant data across sites is often less feasible due to various types of practical constraints, such as data privacy concerns. Moreover, substantial heterogeneity may exist across sites, and locally identified latent classes may not be comparable across sites. We propose a unified modeling framework where a common definition of the latent classes is shared across sites and heterogeneous mixing proportions of latent classes are allowed to account for between-site heterogeneity. To fit the heterogeneous mixture model on multi-site data, we propose a novel distributed Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm where at each iteration a density ratio tilted surrogate Q function is constructed to approximate the standard Q function of the EM algorithm as if the data from multiple sites could be pooled together.

It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states.

These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code.

This opens a promising route to reveal many-body phenomena that evade linear-response probes. To date most experimental applications have focused on classical magnets, and a solid demonstration in a quantum magnet has yet to be established. Here we present a theoretical study of 2DCS in CoNb$_2$O$_6$, a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet that is believed to host fractionalized spinons which at low temperatures are confined by weak interchain coupling. Our analysis, which builds on an effective $S=1/2$ Hamiltonian is found to reveal unambiguous 2DCS signatures of spinon deconfinement above the low-temperature ordered phase. Using a four-spinon approximation, we track these 2DCS signatures by sequentially building a faithful microscopic model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$, starting from the exactly solvable one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (1$d$ TFIM) and successively adding interactions to capture its key low-energy physics. In particular, adding a bond-dependent staggered YZ interaction to the 1$d$-TFIM already reproduces many key spectral features of the full material Hamiltonian. Within this TFIM+YZ model, we find a series of bound states, including a four-spinon bound state that is distinct from the familiar two-spinon bound states. We further find that introducing a confinement potential suppresses sharp spinon-echo features in the two-frequency space, which are thought to reflect an underlying continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our results provide concrete predictions and clear targets for future THz 2DCS experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related quasi-one-dimensional quantum magnets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f53CoNb\u2082O\u2086\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u4e8c\u7ef4\u76f8\u5e72\u5149\u8c31\uff082DCS\uff09\u63a2\u6d4b\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u6570\u5316\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53bb\u7981\u95ed\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u7684\u660e\u786e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u65702DCS\u5b9e\u9a8c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u78c1\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u6570\u5316\u6fc0\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u7684S=1/2\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ece\u4e00\u7ef4\u6a2a\u573a\u4f0a\u8f9b\u6a21\u578b\uff081d TFIM\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5165YZ\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u9650\u5236\u52bf\uff0c\u6784\u5efaCoNb\u2082O\u2086\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u51762DCS\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0TFIM+YZ\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u56db\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9650\u5236\u52bf\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u53cd\u6620\u5206\u6570\u5316\u6fc0\u53d1\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u81ea\u65cb\u56de\u6ce2\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u6709\u5e8f\u76f8\u4e4b\u4e0a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u53bb\u7981\u95ed\u7684\u660e\u786e2DCS\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728CoNb\u2082O\u2086\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u5f00\u5c55\u592a\u8d6b\u51792DCS\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e862DCS\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u5206\u6570\u5316\u6fc0\u53d1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

They avoid the computational-hardness assumptions that underlie the security of classical key exchange. Continuous-Variable QKD (CVQKD), in contrast to qubit-based discrete-variable (DV) schemes, makes use of quadrature measurements of the electromagnetic field. CVQKD has the advantage of being compatible with standard telecom equipment, but at long distances has to deal with very low signal to noise ratios, which necessitates labour-intensive error correction. It is challenging to implement the error correction decoding in realtime.\n  In this paper we introduce a random-codebook error correction method that is suitable for long range Gaussian-modulated CVQKD. We use likelihood ratio scoring with block rejection based on thresholding. For proof-technical reasons, the accept/reject decisions are communicated in encrypted form; in this way we avoid having to deal with non-Gaussian states in the analysis of the leakage. The error correction method is highly parallelisable, which is advantageous for realtime implementation.

However, optimizing the cluster connectivity characteristics that yield a ground state with maximal spin and their robustness against magnetic fields remains unexplored. Employing exact diagonalization of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we find a connection between the existence of kinetic ferromagnetism and graph theory descriptions. Algebraic connectivity ($\u03bb_2$) and Katz centrality (KC) are shown to be related to the spin-correlation over the system. In square arrays, the onset of NFM is found to be $t_c/U\\simeq \u03bb_2^2$. In optimal cluster geometries, large $\u03bb_2$ and low KC fluctuation per site are found to enhance $t_c/U$, extending the NFM phase while diminishing the strength of spin correlation clouds. A perpendicular magnetic field introduces Aharonov-Bohm phases, and a critical flux for which NFM is destroyed. We further find that tuning the flux phase to $\u03c0$ results in a ground state that exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations (counter-Nagaoka state). Our results illustrate how NFM and polaron formation can be predicted from the array's connectivity ($\u03bb_2$ and KC), and how the introduction of flux results in the counterintuitive destruction of kinetic ferromagnetism in the system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316 Hubbard \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u9635\u5217\u4e2d Nagaoka \u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0e\u56fe\u8bba\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027 \u03bb\u2082 \u548c Katz \u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\uff09\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5916\u52a0\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b Aharonov-Bohm \u76f8\u4f4d\u53ef\u7834\u574f\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u5e76\u8bf1\u5bfc\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u81ea\u65cb\u57fa\u6001\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u78c1\u573a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8fde\u63a5\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u89e3Nagaoka\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u8bba\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u03bb\u2082\u548cKatz\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\uff09\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u6784\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5173\u8054\u548c\u78c1\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0Nagaoka\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u03bb\u2082\u00b2\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u9ad8\u03bb\u2082\u548c\u4f4eKC\u6da8\u843d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u754ct/U\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u94c1\u78c1\u76f8\u4f46\u51cf\u5f31\u81ea\u65cb\u5173\u8054\u4e91\uff1b\u5782\u76f4\u78c1\u573a\u5f15\u5165Aharonov-Bohm\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u78c1\u901a\u4e0b\u7834\u574f\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u03c0\u76f8\u4f4d\u65f6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u57fa\u6001\uff08counter-Nagaoka\u6001\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Nagaoka\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u8bba\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5916\u52a0\u78c1\u901a\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u63a7\u751a\u81f3\u9006\u8f6c\u52a8\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u9635\u5217\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Previous studies have shown that the degree of entanglement between two quantum dot qubits is preserved when a metal nanoparticle is used to mediate the interactions between the qubits. In this work, we investigate long-range plasmonic mediation of qubit--qubit entanglement by studying the impact of the number of mediating metal nanoparticles on stationary concurrence. Collinear and periodically spaced metal nanoparticles that satisfy the weak-coupling approximation are considered. An effective model that enables the derivation of the mediated interactions within the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics is employed. Under weak driving at the single particle resonance frequency, the model shows that odd-number arrays are more robust to entanglement decay. We attribute this to strong inter-qubit dissipative coupling as a result of a hybridized dipole plasmon resonating with the driving frequency in odd-number arrays. These arrays can sustain non-vanishing stationary entanglement beyond an inter-qubit spacing of one micron, opening up the possibility of independent spatial optical probing of each quantum dot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u91d1\u5c5e\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u95f4\u957f\u7a0b\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5947\u6570\u4e2a\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u5728\u5f31\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u66f4\u6297\u7ea0\u7f20\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u5fae\u7c73\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u91d1\u5c5e\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u95f4\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7eb3\u7c73\u5149\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u5171\u7ebf\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6392\u5217\u91d1\u5c5e\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8154\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5bf9\u7a33\u6001\u5e76\u53d1\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f31\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u5947\u6570\u4e2a\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6297\u7ea0\u7f20\u8870\u51cf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5076\u6781\u7b49\u79bb\u6fc0\u5143\u4e0e\u9a71\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u5171\u632f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5f3a\u8017\u6563\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u5fae\u7c73\u95f4\u8ddd\u7684\u975e\u96f6\u7a33\u6001\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5947\u6570\u91d1\u5c5e\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5149\u5b66\u63a2\u6d4b\u5355\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a generic equilibrium state. The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions.

To directly examine how heat and charge respond in relation within a kagome metal, we investigate the ferrimagnetic rare-earth 1-6-6 compound TbCr6Ge6 using the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) framework. We observe a dramatic breakdown of the WF law across the ferrimagnetic transition, where both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios, L_{xx,xy} = \u03ba_{xx,xy} / (T \u03c3_{xx,xy}), deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value L_0. After a partial recovery toward L_0 near 5-7 K, the Lorenz ratios are sharply suppressed well below L_0 despite a metallic charge response. We further find a pronounced low-temperature suppression of both L_{xx} and L_{xy} and a sign-changing transverse Lorenz ratio, indicating a clear decoupling between heat and charge transport and signaling substantial contributions from charge-neutral excitations whose Berry-curvature-driven transverse response evolves with temperature and magnetic field. TbCr6Ge6 thus provides a tunable metallic platform in which exchange-driven ferrimagnetism governs both longitudinal and transverse thermal responses, enabling controlled departures from Wiedemann-Franz behavior over an experimentally accessible temperature and field range.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728kagome\u91d1\u5c5eTbCr6Ge6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Wiedemann-Franz\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u7834\u7f3a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u70ed\u4e0e\u7535\u8f93\u8fd0\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u7531\u8d1d\u91cc\u66f2\u7387\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7535\u4e2d\u6027\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u6362\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u5bf9\u7eb5\u5411\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u70ed\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8c03\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76kagome\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e2d\u70ed\u4e0e\u7535\u8f93\u8fd0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7535\u4e2d\u6027\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5728\u70ed\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Wiedemann-Franz\uff08WF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76TbCr6Ge6\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u6bd4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u94c1\u78c1\u8f6c\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230WF\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u94c1\u78c1\u76f8\u53d8\u5904\u663e\u8457\u7834\u7f3a\uff0cL_{xx,xy}\u8fdc\u504f\u79bbSommerfeld\u503cL_0\uff1b\u57285-7 K\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\u540e\uff0c\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u518d\u6b21\u88ab\u5f3a\u70c8\u6291\u5236\u4e14L_{xy}\u51fa\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u70ed\u4e0e\u7535\u8f93\u8fd0\u660e\u663e\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "conclusion": "TbCr6Ge6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ea4\u6362\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\u70ed\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u8c03\u6e29\u533a\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bbWiedemann-Franz\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7535\u4e2d\u6027\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Bruun"], "title": "An exciton interacting with the phonons of an electronic Wigner crystal", "comment": null, "summary": "With the advent of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials, a two-dimensional electronic Wigner crystal has recently been observed. The smoking gun signal was the appearance of an umklapp branch in optical exciton spectroscopy coming from the periodic potential generated by the Wigner crystal assumed to be static. Vibrations of the Wigner crystal however leads to a gapless phonon spectrum, which may affect the exciton spectrum. To explore this, we develop a field theoretical description of an exciton interacting with electrons forming a Wigner crystal including the coupling to the phonons. We show that importance of the exciton-phonon coupling scales with the exciton-electron interaction strength relative to the typical phonon energy squared. The motion of the exciton leads to two kinds of scattering processes, where the exciton emits a phonon either staying within the same Bloch band (intraband scattering) or changing its band (interband scattering). Using a non-perturbative self-consistent Born approximation, we demonstrate that these scattering processes lead to the formation of quasiparticles (polarons) consisting of the exciton in Bloch states dressed by Wigner crystal phonons. The energy shift and damping of these polarons depend on the electron density in a non-trivial way since it affects both the exciton-phonon interaction strength, as well as the phonon and exciton spectra. In particular, the damping is strongly affected by whether the polaron energy is inside the gapless phonon scattering continuum or not. Using these results, we finally analyse their effects on the observed spectral properties of the exciton.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7535\u5b50Wigner\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u6fc0\u5b50\u4e0e\u58f0\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u573a\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6fc0\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f62\u6210\u7531Wigner\u6676\u683c\u58f0\u5b50\u4fee\u9970\u7684\u6781\u5316\u5b50\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u5176\u80fd\u91cf\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\u53d7\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eWigner\u6676\u4f53\u632f\u52a8\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u80fd\u9699\u58f0\u5b50\u8c31\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6fc0\u5b50\u8c31\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\u6fc0\u5b50\u4e0e\u5f62\u6210Wigner\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u53ca\u58f0\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u573a\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u7684\u81ea\u6d3dBorn\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6fc0\u5b50\u4e0eWigner\u6676\u4f53\u7535\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u58f0\u5b50\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6fc0\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6fc0\u5b50-\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5178\u578b\u58f0\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff1b\u6fc0\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u5e26\u5185\u548c\u5e26\u95f4\u58f0\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6781\u5316\u5b50\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u5176\u80fd\u91cf\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d7\u662f\u5426\u5904\u4e8e\u58f0\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u8fde\u7eed\u533a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdWigner\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u5b50\u5149\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u6781\u5316\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

The method constructs a fully antisymmetric wavefunction from the product of two independently antisymmetrized many-body states, each of which may be a superposition of Slater determinants. The algorithm uses a Dicke-state ancilla register that coherently encodes all one-particle exchange channels between the two subsystems, and, crucially, requires only single-particle swaps to generate the full antisymmetric structure. A total of $O(N_T N_p)$ single-particle exchanges are needed, with up to $N_p$ of them implemented in parallel, if an additional $N_p$ ancillae are used. The correct fermionic phase is incorporated through application of $Z$ gates on $N_T$ ancillae, after which the ancilla register is efficiently uncomputed using a compact sequence of controlled operations. This construction provides a nontrivial and scalable protocol for preparing fully antisymmetric states in reaction and scattering simulations, significantly expanding the range of systems that can be addressed with first-quantized quantum algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u5168\u540c\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7684\u9776-\u5f39\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528Dicke\u6001\u8f85\u52a9\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u548c\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u64cd\u4f5c\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u9020\u591a\u4f53\u5168\u540c\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u6240\u6709\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u901a\u9053\u7684Dicke\u6001\u8f85\u52a9\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u64cd\u4f5c\u548cZ\u95e8\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u5316\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u6001\u4e58\u79ef\u51fa\u53d1\u6784\u9020\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u64cd\u4f5c\u9ad8\u6548\u53cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f85\u52a9\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700O(N_T N_p)\u6b21\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884cN_p\u6b21\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u989d\u5916N_p\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5f15\u5165\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6001\u5236\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

While it fully reproduces conventional quantum mechanics, this approach provides an alternative framework that enables the study of dynamical quantities not easily defined within the standard formulation. In the present work, stochastic quantization is employed to investigate tunneling-time statistics for bound states in double-well potentials. Using first-passage time theory within the stochastic quantization framework, both the mean tunneling time, $\\bar\u03c4$, and the full probability distribution, $p(\u03c4)$, are computed, and the theoretical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations of stochastic trajectories for the two potentials considered as representative cases. For the square double-well potential, analytical expressions for $\\bar\u03c4$ are derived and show excellent agreement with simulations. In the high-barrier limit, the results reveal a direct relation between the stochastic-mechanical and quantum-mechanical tunneling times, expressed as $\u03c4_{\\mathrm{QM}} = (\u03c0/2)\\bar\u03c4$, where $\u03c4_{\\mathrm{QM}}$ corresponds to half the oscillation period of the probability of finding the particle in either well. This relation is further confirmed for generic double-well systems through a WKB analysis. As a concrete application, the inversion dynamics of the ammonia molecule is analyzed, yielding an inversion frequency of approximately $24$ GHz, in close agreement with experimental observations. These results highlight the potential of stochastic quantization as a powerful and physically insightful framework for analyzing tunneling phenomena in quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528Nelson\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u968f\u673a\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9996\u901a\u65f6\u95f4\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u52bf\u9631\u4e2d\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7684\u96a7\u7a7f\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5e73\u5747\u96a7\u7a7f\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65b9\u578b\u53cc\u52bf\u9631\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u9ad8\u52bf\u5792\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u968f\u673a\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u96a7\u7a7f\u65f6\u95f4\u6ee1\u8db3\u03c4_QM = (\u03c0/2)\u03c4\u0304\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7WKB\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6c28\u5206\u5b50\u7ffb\u8f6c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7ea624 GHz\u7684\u7ffb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u96be\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u67d0\u4e9b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u96a7\u7a7f\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u96a7\u7a7f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u89c6\u4e3a\u7531\u666e\u6717\u514b\u5e38\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\u6da8\u843d\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9996\u901a\u65f6\u95f4\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u53cc\u52bf\u9631\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u96a7\u7a7f\u65f6\u95f4\u03c4\u0304\u548c\u96a7\u7a7f\u65f6\u95f4\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03p(\u03c4)\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "1. \u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b9\u578b\u53cc\u52bf\u9631\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u96a7\u7a7f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u543b\u5408\uff1b2. \u5728\u9ad8\u52bf\u5792\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u53d1\u73b0\u03c4_QM = (\u03c0/2)\u03c4\u0304\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7WKB\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u5173\u7cfb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u53cc\u52bf\u9631\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b3. \u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6c28\u5206\u5b50\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7ffb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a24 GHz\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u503c\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96a7\u7a7f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

The squeezing field is implemented in cavities rather than continuous waveguides, thereby limiting its scalability for applications in quantum simulation. Giant atoms, which couple to waveguides at multiple points, provide a promising route to mitigate dissipation via engineered interference, enabling decoherence-free interactions. We extend the squeezing-amplified interaction to a novel quantum platform combining giant atoms with traveling-wave parametric waveguides based on $\u03c7^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. By exploiting destructive interference between different coupling points, the interaction between giant atoms is not only significantly enhanced but also becomes immune to squeezed noise. Unlike conventional waveguide quantum electrodynamics without a squeezing pump, the giant emitters exhibit both exchange and pairing interactions, making this platform particularly suitable for simulating many-body quantum physics. More intriguingly, the strengths of these interactions can be smoothly tuned by adjusting the squeezing and coupling parameters. Our architecture thus provides a versatile and scalable platform for quantum simulation of strongly correlated physics and paves the way toward robust quantum control in many-body regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5de8\u539f\u5b50\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u03c7^(2)\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u884c\u6ce2\u53c2\u91cf\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5229\u7528 destructive interference \u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u5f3a\u4e14\u6297\u538b\u7f29\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53c2\u91cf\u653e\u5927\u4e2d\u538b\u7f29\u573a\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u989d\u5916\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u8154\u57fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5de8\u539f\u5b50\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u03c7^(2)\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u884c\u6ce2\u53c2\u91cf\u6ce2\u5bfc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u70b9\u95f4\u7684 destructive interference \u6291\u5236\u538b\u7f29\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5de8\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u914d\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u5176\u514d\u53d7\u538b\u7f29\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u8fde\u7eed\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a self-testing protocol for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state based on a natural generalization of Hardy's nonlocality argument. Within this framework, we prove that the correlation achieving the maximal Hardy success probability constitutes an extremal point of the quantum correlation set and, moreover, that this point is \\emph{exposed}. To address experimentally relevant imperfections, we further develop a robust self-testing analysis tailored to the Hardy construction. Additionally, we show that, in this scenario, the quantum correlation that attains the maximal violation of the Hardy-type paradox coincides with the correlation that yields the maximal violation of the Mermin inequality. This establishes a unified perspective in which the same multipartite correlation admits both a logical-paradox interpretation and a Bell-inequality-based characterization.

It underpins fundamental processes ranging from nuclear fusion and photosynthesis to the operation of superconducting qubits. Yet the underlying dynamics of particle motion during tunnelling remain subtle and are still the subject of active debate. Here, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the tunnelling process, we show that the particle velocity inside the barrier continuously relaxes from a large initial value toward a smaller one, and may even approach zero in the evanescent regime. Meanwhile, the probability density within the barrier gradually builds up before reaching its stationary profile, in contrast to existing inherently. In addition, starting from the steady-state equations, we derive an explicit relation between the particle velocity and the barrier width, and show that the velocity in evanescent states approaches zero when the barrier is sufficiently wide. These findings resolve the apparent paradox of a vanishing steady-state velocity coexisting with a finite particle density.

Quantum simulation is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, like many quantum algorithms, it is severely constrained by noise in near-term hardware. Quantum-inspired algorithms provide an attractive alternative by avoiding the need for error-prone quantum devices. In this study, we demonstrate that the coherent Ising machine and simulated bifurcation algorithms can accurately reproduce the electronic energy profiles of H_2 and H_2O, capturing their essential energetic features. Notably, we obtain computational times of 1.2 s and 2.4 s for the H_2 and H_2O profiles, respectively, representing a substantial speed-up compared to gate-based quantum computing approaches, which typically require at least 6 s to compute a single molecular geometry with comparable accuracy.

We focus on the non-linear $\u03b1(Z\u03b1)^{n\\ge 3}$ contribution to the vacuum polarization density, computing the energy shift of 1s$_{1/2}$ states of hydrogen-like ions. Our goal is to improve the numerical computations to achieve a precision comparable to that of Green's function methods reported in the literature. To do so, an analytic expression for the linear contribution to the vacuum polarization density is derived using Riesz projectors. Alternative formulations of the vacuum polarization density and their relation is discussed. The convergence of the finite Gaussian basis scheme is investigated, and the numerical difficulties that arise are characterized.

The authors interpret $\u03bd$ as the speed of quantum particles, even in the classically forbidden regime, and claim that its finite value contradicts the Bohmian mechanics prediction of zero particle velocity. This challenge arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the operational meaning of v within the Bohmian ontological framework. We demonstrate that v quantifies the spatial gradient of the wavefunctions amplitude, a geometric property of the guiding field, not the kinematical velocity of point-like particles. The experiment therefore does not challenge but rather illustrates the clean ontological separation between the wave and particle aspects inherent to Bohmian mechanics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51faSharoglazova\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bef\u89e3\u4e86Bohm\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u901f\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u03bd\u7684\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u03bd\u53cd\u6620\u7684\u662f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u52a8\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u4e0d\u8fdd\u80ccBohm\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05\u8fd1\u671f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9Bohmian\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7c92\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u03bd\u53c2\u6570\u5728Bohm\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u542b\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8026\u5408\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u03bd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Bohmian\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u03bd\u662f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u5bfc\u5f15\u573a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u975e\u96f6\u03bd\u503c\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e0eBohmian\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7c92\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u03bd\u6240\u8868\u793a\u7684\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u672a\u6311\u6218Bohmian\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u6ce2\u4e0e\u7c92\u5b50\u672c\u4f53\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u6027\u3002"}}

Exciting trapped ions to high-lying electronic Rydberg states provides a promising route to overcome these limitations by enabling strong, long-range dipole-dipole interactions that support much faster multi-qubit operations. Here, we introduce the first scheme for implementing a native controlled-controlled-Z gate with microwave-dressed Rydberg ions by optimizing a single-pulse protocol that accounts for the finite Rydberg-state lifetime. The resulting gate outperforms standard decompositions into one- and two-qubit gates by achieving fidelities above 97% under realistic conditions, with execution times of about 2 microseconds at cryogenic temperatures. To explore the potential of trapped Rydberg ions for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, and to illustrate the utility of three-qubit Rydberg-ion gates in this context, we develop and analyze a proposal for fault-tolerant, measurement-free quantum error correction using the nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code. Our simulations confirm that quantum error correction can be performed in a fully fault-tolerant manner on a linear Rydberg-ion chain despite its limited qubit connectivity. These results establish native multiqubit Rydberg-ion gates as a valuable resource for fast, high-fidelity quantum computing and highlight their potential for fault-tolerant quantum error correction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u6ce2\u4fee\u9970\u7684\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u79bb\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u751f\u4e09\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u53d7\u63a7-\u53d7\u63a7-Z\u95e8\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08>97%\uff09\u548c\u77ed\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u7ea62\u5fae\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e5d\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279Bacon-Shor\u7801\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u3001\u65e0\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u5b50\u9631\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u96be\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u6001\u5f3a\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u8109\u51b2\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u6ce2\u4fee\u9970\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u6709\u9650\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u6001\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u751f\u7684\u4e09\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u53d7\u63a7-\u53d7\u63a7-Z\u95e8\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u79bb\u5b50\u94fe\u4e0a\u7684\u4e5d\u6bd4\u7279Bacon-Shor\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc797%\u7684\u95e8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7ea62\u5fae\u79d2\u7684\u95e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u5b9e\u53ef\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u79bb\u5b50\u94fe\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u5bb9\u9519\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u3002", "conclusion": "\u539f\u751f\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u79bb\u5b50\u95e8\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u901f\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7528\u4e8e\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Yet, while the relation between entanglement and topology is well established, little is known about the role of nonstabilizerness (or magic), a pivotal concept in fault-tolerant quantum computation, in topological phases. We introduce the concept of topological magic response, the ability of a state to spread over stabilizer space when perturbed by finite-depth non-Clifford circuits. Unlike a topological invariant or order parameter, this response function probes how a phase reacts to non-Clifford perturbations, revealing the presence of non-local quantum correlations. In Ising-type spin chains, we show that symmetry-broken and paramagnetic phases lack such a response, whereas symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases always display it. To capture this, we utilize a combination of stabilizer R\u00e9nyi entropies that, in analogy with topological entanglement entropy, isolates non-locally stored information. Using exact analytic computations and matrix product states simulations based on an algorithmic technique we introduce, we show that SPT phases doped with $T$ gates support robust topological magic response, while trivial phases remain featureless.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u9b54\u6cd5\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u5728\u975eClifford\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u5177\u6709\u8be5\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u5e73\u51e1\u76f8\u5219\u65e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u6027\uff08magic\uff09\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u7269\u6001\u4e2d\u975eClifford\u6270\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u5b50R\u00e9nyi\u71b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u6001\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u63ba\u6742T\u95e8\u7684SPT\u76f8\u4e0e\u5e73\u51e1\u76f8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u7f3a\u548c\u987a\u78c1\u76f8\u65e0\u62d3\u6251\u9b54\u6cd5\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u800cSPT\u76f8\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8be5\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u63ba\u6742T\u95e8\u7684SPT\u76f8\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u9b54\u6cd5\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d3\u6251\u9b54\u6cd5\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522bSPT\u76f8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5b58\u50a8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u975eClifford\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

With the right ansatz design, this approach can be extended to system sizes beyond the reach of classical simulation, enabling scalable training for larger quantum systems.

However, nonlocality is a statement about static correlations only. It does not take into account dynamics, i.e. time evolution of those correlations. Consider a dynamic situation where the correlations remain local for all times. Then at each moment in time there exists a local hidden-variable (LHV) model reproducing the momentary correlations. Can the time evolution of the correlations then be captured by evolving the hidden variables? In this light, we define dynamical LHV models and motivate and discuss potential additional physical and mathematical assumptions. Based on a simple counter example we conjecture that such LHV dynamics does not always exist. This is further substantiated by a rigorous no-go theorem.

Historically, these have been associated with emission and absorption processes at the quantum level and are characteristic of the language of second quantization. In this work, we formulate the transition from first to second quantization by taking quotients of the state spaces of distinguishable particles, so that the resulting equivalence classes identify states that contain no information capable of distinguishing between particles, thereby generalising the usual symmetrisation procedure. Assuming that the resulting indistinguishable-particle space (i) admits an ordered basis compatible with how an observer may label the accessible modes, (ii) is invariant under unitary transformations of those modes, and (iii) supports particle counting as a mode-wise local operation, we derive a new class of creation-annihilation algebras.

Using this criterion, we uncover several new features of multi-qubit magic distillation and detection. We prove that genuinely multi-qubit magic distillation protocols are strictly more powerful than all single-qubit schemes by showing that the Triangle Criterion is not stable under tensor products, in sharp contrast to the PPT criterion. Moreover, we show that, with overwhelming probability, multi-qubit magic states with relatively low rank cannot be distilled by any single-qubit distillation protocol. We derive an upper bound on the minimal purity of magic states, which is conjectured to be tight with both numerical and constructive evidences.

In information theory, the contraction coefficient measures how much the distinguishability of quantum states decreases when they are transmitted through a quantum channel, establishing linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI). However, these linear SDPI are not always tight and can be improved in most of the cases. In this work, we establish non-linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergence for noisy channels that satisfy a certain noise criterion. We also note that our results improve upon existing linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergences and also non-linear SDPI for classical hockey-stick divergence. We define $F_\u03b3$ curves generalizing Dobrushin curves for the quantum setting while characterizing SDPI for the sequential composition of heterogeneous channels. In addition, we derive reverse-Pinsker type inequalities for $f$-divergences with additional constraints on hockey-stick divergences. We show that these non-linear SDPI can establish tighter finite mixing times that cannot be achieved through linear SDPI. Furthermore, we find applications of these in establishing stronger privacy guarantees for the composition of sequential private quantum channels when privacy is quantified by quantum local differential privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u68d2\u7403\u68cd\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08SDPI\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027SDPI\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50F_\u03b3\u66f2\u7ebf\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u5f02\u6784\u4fe1\u9053\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u5408\u7684SDPI\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5728\u9644\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0bf-\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u53cd\u5411Pinsker\u578b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u987a\u5e8f\u79c1\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ebf\u6027\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u591f\u7d27\u81f4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027SDPI\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u68d2\u7403\u68cd\u6563\u5ea6\u548cf-\u6563\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f15\u5165F_\u03b3\u66f2\u7ebf\u63a8\u5e7fDobrushin\u66f2\u7ebf\u81f3\u91cf\u5b50\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027SDPI\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u63a8\u5bfc\u53cd\u5411Pinsker\u578b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027SDPI\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86F_\u03b3\u66f2\u7ebf\u7528\u4e8e\u523b\u753b\u5f02\u6784\u4fe1\u9053\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u989d\u5916\u7ea6\u675f\u7684f-\u6563\u5ea6\u53cd\u5411Pinsker\u578b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027SDPI\u53ef\u5bfc\u51fa\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7248\u672c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8870\u51cf\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The construction has the additional advantage that each purification has a mean photon number which is exactly twice that of the initial state. Our construction relies on the characterisation of the commutant of passive Gaussian unitaries via the representation theory of dual reductive pairs of unitary groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u65af\u7248\u672c\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7eaf\u5316\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u65e0\u6e90\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7eaf\u5316\u6001\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u6070\u597d\u662f\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5176\u968f\u673a\u9ad8\u65af\u7eaf\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5076\u7ea6\u5316\u5bf9\u9149\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u65e0\u6e90\u9ad8\u65af\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8be5\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u7eaf\u5316\u4fe1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5c06n\u4e2a\u65e0\u6e90\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\u590d\u5236\u4e3an\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u9ad8\u65af\u7eaf\u5316\u6001\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u4e14\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7eaf\u5316\u6001\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u4e3a\u539f\u6001\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u7eaf\u5316\u4fe1\u9053\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this work, we study the single-electron Holstein model and propose an initial-state ansatz that substantially enhances ground state overlap in the strong coupling regime, thereby reducing the number of iterations required in standard quantum phase estimation. We further show that this ansatz can be implemented efficiently and yields an exponential reduction in overall circuit costs relative to conventional initial guesses. Our results highlight the practical value of incorporating physical intuition into initial state preparation for electron-phonon coupled systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u8bd5\u63a2\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f3a\u8026\u5408 regime\u4e0b\u5355\u7535\u5b50Holstein\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7535\u8def\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7535\u8def\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u5236\u5907\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u7535\u5b50Holstein\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u8bd5\u63a2\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bd5\u63a2\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408 regime\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u603b\u7535\u8def\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u878d\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u5236\u5907\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}
