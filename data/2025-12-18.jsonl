The content is subject to change based on the outcome of the peer-review process and should not be considered final or definitive", "summary": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are trained to predict forecast error for the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model using the New York State Mesonet and Oklahoma State Mesonet near-surface weather observations as ground truth. Physical and dynamical mechanisms tied to LSTM performance are evaluated by comparing the New York domain to the Oklahoma domain. The contrasting geography and atmospheric dynamics of the two domains provide a compelling scientific foil. Evaluating them side by side highlights variations in LSTM prediction of forecast error that are closely linked to region-specific phenomena driven by both dynamics and geography. Using mean-absolute-error and percent improvement relative to HRRR, LSTMs predict precipitation error most accurately, followed by wind error and then temperature error. Precipitation errors exhibit an asymmetry, with overforecast precipitation detected more accurately than underforecast, while wind error predictions are consistent across over- and underforecast predictions. Temperature error predictions are relatively accurate but smoother, with respect to variance, than true observations. This paper describes an overview of LSTM performance with the expressed intent of providing forecasters with real-time predictions of forecast error at the point of use within the New York State and Oklahoma State Mesonets. This research demonstrates the potential of LSTM-based machine learning models to provide actionable, location-specific predictions of forecast error for high-resolution operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems."}

Results reveal seasonal variability: strong NAO--CUI coupling in winter (DJF; $r = +0.65$), local upwelling dominance in summer (JJA; $r = -0.46$ CUI--SST), and a north--south gradient with intense southern upwelling (mean Ekman transport $37.1 \\pm 34.5$ m$^3$/s/100m).

NASA's Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG Final Run) combines information from \"all\" satellite microwave observations with gauge correction and climatological adjustment to produce precipitation estimates at 0.1° spatial and 30-min temporal resolution. However, its latency of approximately 3.5 months restricts its utility for real-time applications, despite outperforming mainstream satellite precipitation datasets in representing rainfall patterns and variability. We present Huayu, a novel machine learning-based real-time satellite precipitation retrieval system that relies solely on infrared observations from the FengYun-4B geostationary satellite to provide a more accurate precipitation estimate at a finer spatiotemporal resolution (15 min, 0.05°) over a 120° by 120° domain. Performance evaluations demonstrate that Huayu achieves strong consistency with rain gauge observations, yielding a critical success index (CSI) of 0.693 - representing a 3.43% improvement over IMERG Final Run (CSI: 0.670).

However, training them typically requires large, diverse datasets, often created via synthetic unit cell simulations. This hinders practical adoption because physical experiments on standardized specimens with simple geometries fail to generate sufficiently diverse stress-strain trajectories. Consequently, an unreasonably large number of experiments or complex multi-axial tests would be needed. This work shows that such networks can be trained from a single specimen subjected to simple uniaxial loading, by designing the specimen using a novel automatically differentiable elastoplastic topology optimization method. Our strategy diversifies the stress-strain states observed in a single test involving plastic deformation. We then employ the automatically differentiable model updating (ADiMU) method to train the neural network surrogates. This work demonstrates that topology-optimized specimens under simple loading can train large neural networks, thereby substantially reducing the experimental burden associated with data-driven material modeling."}

At the core of PyFi is PyFi-600K, a dataset comprising 600K financial question-answer pairs organized into a reasoning pyramid: questions at the base require only basic perception, while those toward the apex demand increasing levels of capability in financial visual understanding and expertise. This data is scalable because it is synthesized without human annotations, using PyFi-adv, a multi-agent adversarial mechanism under the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm, in which, for each image, a challenger agent competes with a solver agent by generating question chains that progressively probe deeper capability levels in financial visual reasoning. Leveraging this dataset, we present fine-grained, hierarchical, and comprehensive evaluations of advanced VLMs in the financial domain. Moreover, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the pyramid-structured question chains enables these models to answer complex financial questions by decomposing them into sub-questions with gradually increasing reasoning demands, yielding average accuracy improvements of 19.52% and 8.06%, respectively, on the dataset.

Understanding how interventions propagate through such systems requires causal inference methods that go beyond direct effects to quantify mediated pathways.

In this paper, we propose a scalable mediation analysis framework tailored for large causal DAGs involving multiple treatments and mediators. Our approach systematically decomposes total effects into interpretable direct and indirect components.

In this problem, the decision maker considers items for which either weights or values, or both, are random. The aim is to select a subset of these items to be included into their knapsack. We study both \"static\" and \"dynamic\" variants of this problem: in the static setting, the decision about which items should be included in the knapsack is taken at the outset, before any random item value or weight is revealed; in the dynamic setting, items are received sequentially, and the decision about a particular item is made by taking into account previously observed values and weights. The knapsack has a given capacity, and if the total realised weight exceeds this capacity then a penalty cost is incurred for each unit of excess capacity utilised. The goal is to maximise the expected net profit. We tackle the case of normally distributed item weights and we show that our approach extends seamlessly to the case in which item weights are correlated and follow a multivariate normal distribution. In addition, we show our approach represents an effective heuristic for the case in which item weights follow generic probability distributions. In an extensive computational study we demonstrate that our models are near-optimal and more scalable than other state-of-the-art approaches."}

We consider two common FDTD interface models based on different staggered-grid placements of material parameters. For each, we derive discrete analogs of the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients by formulating effective boundary conditions that emerge from the Yee update equations. A key insight is that the staggered grid implicitly spreads the material discontinuity over a transition layer of one spatial step, leading to systematic deviations from exact theory. We quantify these errors via a transition-layer model and provide (i) qualitative criteria predicting the direction and nature of deviations, and (ii) rigorous error estimates for both weak and strong impedance contrasts. Finally, we examine the role of the Courant number in modulating these errors, revealing conditions under which numerical dispersion and interface discretization jointly influence accuracy."}

A meron cluster algorithm recently formulated for gauge fields represented as spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ quantum links coupled to a single flavour of staggered fermions samples only two of the exponentially many Gauss law (GL) sectors at low temperatures, making it possible to simulate either of those two GL sectors at zero temperature in polynomial time. In this article, we analytically identify GL sectors which can be simulated without encountering the fermion sign problem in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods, we further explore the nature of phases in the GL sectors dominating at zero temperature. The vacuum states lie in sectors which satisfy a staggered Gauss law, in contrast to the zero GL sector familiar in particle physics. Moreover, we prove that while the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, the usual zero-charge GL sector (often considered the physical sector) does. We outline the role of the magnetic energy in causing transitions between GL sectors. We expect our results to be valid for truncated Kogut-Susskind gauge theories, beyond quantum link models."}

Companion to \"Tournament-Based Performance Evaluation and Systematic Misallocation\" (arXiv:2512.06583). 21 references", "summary": "Why do organizations comprised of intelligent individuals converge on collective delusion? This paper introduces dysmemic pressure as a formal mechanism explaining organizational epistemic failure. Synthesizing strategic communication theory (Crawford & Sobel, 1982), agency theory (Prendergast, 1993), and cultural evolution (Boyd & Richerson, 1985), I demonstrate how preference divergence between organizational agents generates stable equilibria where communication becomes statistically independent of reality, while transmission biases lock dysfunction into self-reinforcing states. The mechanism operates through identifiable dynamics: as the bias between sender and receiver preferences increases, communication precision degrades through progressively coarser partitions until reaching \"babbling equilibrium\" where messages carry no information; simultaneously, transmission biases (content, prestige, conformity) ensure that dysfunctional signals outcompete accurate ones in the organizational meme pool. Three detailed case studies--Nokia's smartphone collapse, NASA's Challenger disaster, and Wells Fargo's account fraud scandal--illustrate the mechanism's operation across industries and failure modes. I derive five testable propositions and evaluate potential countermeasures through a mechanism design lens. The analysis reframes organizational dysfunction from moral failure to physics problem, explaining why standard interventions (culture change, leadership development, values alignment) so often fail: they treat equilibrium outcomes as behavioral problems rather than altering the selection environment that produces them."}

However, one major challenge in applying ML to cementitious materials is the limited size and diversity of available databases. A promising solution is the development of multi-modal databases that integrate both numerical and graphical data. Conventional ML frameworks in cement research are typically restricted to a single data modality. Graph neural network (GNN) represents a new generation of neural architectures capable of learning from data structured as graphs, capturing relationships through irregular or topology-dependent connections rather than fixed spatial coordinates. While GNN is inherently designed for graphical data, they can be adapted to extract correlations from numerical datasets and potentially embed physical laws directly into their architecture, enabling explainable and physics-informed predictions. This work is among the first few studies to implement GNNs to design concrete, with a particular emphasis on establishing a clear and reproducible pathway for converting tabular data into graph representations using the k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach. Model hyperparameters and feature selection are systematically optimized to enhance prediction performance. The GNN shows performance comparable to the benchmark random forest, which has been demonstrated by many studies to yield reliable predictions for cementitious materials. Overall, this study provides a foundational roadmap for transitioning from traditional ML to advanced AI architectures. The proposed framework establishes a strong foundation for future multi-modal and physics-informed GNN models capable of capturing complex material behaviors and accelerating the design and optimization of cementitious materials."}

For such systems to be effective, two objectives must be met: (i) accurate point forecasts of the time series must be produced, and (ii) the long-term statistical behaviour of the underlying data-generating process must be replicated. The latter objective, often referred to as learning the climate, is closely related to the task of producing accurate distribution forecasts. Empirical evidence shows that distribution forecasts are far more stable than point forecasts, which are sensitive to initial conditions. In this work, we rigorously study this phenomenon for state-space systems. The main result shows that, if the underlying data-generating process is structurally stable and possesses a mixing or an attracting measure, then a sufficiently regular initial probability distribution remains close to the true future distribution at arbitrarily long time horizons when forecasted by a $C^1-$close state-space proxy. Thus, under these conditions, learning the climate of a dynamic process with a universal family of state-space systems is feasible with arbitrarily high accuracy."}

In addition, a reformulated Poisson equation, coupled with the macroscopic moment equations, is introduced to overcome the inefficiency of the standard Poisson formulation in the quasineutral regime. The accuracy and asymptotic consistency of the proposed schemes are verified through several benchmark tests, including linear and nonlinear Landau damping and the bump-on-tail instability. The results demonstrate that the methods robustly capture plasma dynamics across hydrodynamic and quasineutral regimes, without resolution constraints imposed by either the Debye length or the mean free path."}

Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates."}

Latent Class Regression (LCR) models offer a principled approach to identify subgroups with shared sleep behaviour profiles whilst incorporating predictors of group membership, but Bayesian inference for these models has been hindered by computational challenges and the absence of variable selection methods. We propose a fully Bayesian framework for LCR that uses Pólya-Gamma data augmentation, enabling efficient sampling of regression coefficients. We extend this framework to include variable selection for both predictors and item responses: predictor variable selection via latent inclusion indicators and item selection through a partially collapsed approach. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed methods yield accurate parameter estimates, resolve identifiability issues arising in full models and successfully identify informative predictors and items while excluding noise variables. Applying this methodology to CSHQ data from 148 children reveals distinct latent subgroups with different sleep behaviour profiles, anxious nighttime sleepers, short/light sleepers and those with more pervasive sleep problems, with each carrying distinct implications for intervention. Results also highlight the predictive role of Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis in subgroup membership. These findings demonstrate the limitations of conventional CSHQ scoring and illustrate the benefits of a probabilistic subgroup-based approach as an alternative for understanding paediatric sleep difficulties."}

In solution reconstruction, parameters of a physical model are estimated from sparse measurement data as a means to obtain the full solution field. In contrast, inverse problems target the missing parameters and estimate the solution along the way. Noting the similarity of the mathematical formulations of these two tasks, we investigate the use of ECFM to solve inverse problems. First, we compare the ECFM formulation of the inverse problem to a standard approach using two numerical examples. The first example provides an extension of ECFM to dynamic problems, and the second offers a novel approach to treat noisy measurement data. Next, we introduce a method to solve inverse problems for which the parameterized model has stochastic components. This approach is based on constraint forces and the polynomial chaos expansion, and is illustrated with another numerical example. Finally, we discuss extensions of ECFM to recover missing boundary conditions and domain geometries from measurement data, which are shown to be special cases of problems treated previously in the literature. The purpose of this work is to extend the mathematical framework of ECFM to novel applications and to gauge the method's viability as an alternative strategy for inverse analysis."}

Over the pre-Dencun (London+Merge) window, a 10 percentage point increase in L2 adoption lowers median base fees by about 13% -- roughly 5 Gwei at pre-Dencun levels -- and deviations from the long-run relation decay with an 11-day half-life.

While the theoretical quantum speed-up from T_cl=2^{57.8} (classical) to T_qu = 2^{28.9} (quantum) is mathematically sound, the practical implementation overhead is so extreme that attacks remain wholly infeasible in both resource and runtime dimensions. Using Qiskit-based circuit synthesis, we derive that a 3-round Keccak quantum oracle requires: 9,600 Toffoli gates (with uncomputation for reversibility); 3,200 logical qubits (1,600 state + 1,600 auxiliary); 7.47 * 10^{13} total 2-qubit gates (full Grover search); 3.2 million physical qubits (with quantum error correction)PROHIBITIVE; 0.12 years (43 days) to 2,365+ years execution time, depending on machine assumptions. These barriers -- particularly the physical qubit requirements, circuit depth, and error accumulation -- render the quantum attack infeasible for any foreseeable quantum computer. Consequently, SHA-3 security is not threatened by quantum computers for preimage attacks. We emphasize the critical importance of hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis: the elegant asymptotic theory of Grover's Algorithm hides an engineering overhead so prohibitive that the quantum approach becomes infeasible from both resource and implementation perspectives."}

The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling. It captures inter-token dependencies across modalities through a unified absorbing diffusion process, and estimates per-token distributions via categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. Extensive empirical results show that HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite being developed under limited computational resources. It highlights the viability of simultaneously estimating categorical and continuous distributions within a unified language model architecture, offering a promising alternative direction for multimodal pLMs."}

A key insight is that the staggered grid implicitly spreads the material discontinuity over a transition layer of one spatial step, leading to systematic deviations from exact theory. We quantify these errors via a transition-layer model and provide (i) qualitative criteria predicting the direction and nature of deviations, and (ii) rigorous error estimates for both weak and strong impedance contrasts.

The performance of the IGA-SVR model is rigorously evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art baseline models, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the forward-validating genetic algorithm optimized support vector regression (OGA-SVR). Extensive testing was conducted on the five global indices, namely Nifty, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), DAX Performance Index (DAX), Nikkei 225 (N225), and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE) from 2021 to 2024 of daily price prediction up to a year. Overall, the proposed IGA-SVR model achieved a reduction in MAPE by 19.87% compared to LSTM and 50.03% compared to OGA-SVR, demonstrating its superior performance in long-term daily price forecasting of global indices. Further, the execution time for LSTM was approximately 20 times higher than that of IGA-SVR, highlighting the high accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model. The genetic algorithm selects the optimal hyperparameters of SVR by minimizing the arithmetic mean of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) calculated over the full training dataset and the most recent five years of training data. This purposefully designed training methodology adjusts for recent trends while retaining long-term trend information, thereby offering enhanced generalization compared to the LSTM and rolling-forward validation approach employed by OGA-SVR, which forgets long-term trends and suffers from recency bias."}

The performance of these algorithms strongly depends on the choice of the gridding kernel, with the first prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) regarded as optimal. This work redefines kernel optimality through the lens of vector optimization (VO), introducing a rigorous framework that characterizes optimal kernels as Pareto-efficient solutions of an error shape operator. We establish the continuity of such operator, study the existence of solutions, and propose a novel methodology to construct kernels tailored to a desired target error function. The approach is implemented numerically via interior-point optimization. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed kernels outperform both the PSWF and the state-of-the-art methods (MIRT-NUFFT) in specific regions of interest, achieving orders-of-magnitude improvements in mean absolute errors. These results confirm the potential of VO-based kernel design to provide customized accuracy profiles aligned with application-specific requirements. Future research will extend this framework to multidimensional cases and relative error minimization, with potential integration of machine learning for adaptive target error selection."}

Here we show that a Dirac spectral programming framework enables programmable topological cluster synchronization on directed hypergraphs. By encoding tail-head hyperedges into a topological Dirac operator and introducing a tunable mass term, we obtain a spectrum whose isolated eigenvalues correspond to distinct synchronization clusters defined jointly on nodes and hyperedges. Selecting a target eigenvalue allows the system to self-organize toward the associated cluster state without modifying the underlying hypergraph structure. Simulations on directed-hypergraph block models and empirical systems--including higher-order contact networks and the ABIDE functional brain network--confirm that spectral selection alone determines the accessible synchronization patterns. Our results establish a general and interpretable route for controlling collective dynamics in directed higher-order systems."}

These dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties, a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop) schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU framework employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a two-species and a four-species biofilm model. Both demonstrate that our method not only accurately recovers the underlying model parameters but also provides predictive responses consistent with the synthetic data."}

First, when the hysteron span - the gap between its two hysteretic transitions - dominates all other scales, the range of pathways encoded in transition graphs (t-graphs) becomes limited because many avalanches {are} absent.

Specifically, we reinterpret the Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm bounds as estimators of the energy expectation value and variance, respectively, and relate them to the shortest time for the processor to orthogonalize a quantum state. This shortest gate time, expected to lie on the nanosecond scale, is inferred from job execution times measured in seconds by employing gate-time amplification. We apply the method to IBM's superconducting quantum processor and estimate the energy scales associated with single-, two-, and three-qubit gates. The order of estimated energy is consistent with typical drive energies in superconducting qubit systems, suggesting that current gate operations approach the quantum speed limit. Our results demonstrate that fundamental energetic properties of black-box quantum computers can be quantitatively accessed through operational time measurements, reflecting the conjugate relationship between time and energy imposed by the uncertainty principle."}

The neural network discretization of the solution field is naturally adaptive and avoids meshing the computational domain, which can both improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and streamline implementation. However, there have been limited studies of PINNs on complex three-dimensional geometries, as the lack of mesh and the reliance on the strong form of the partial differential equation (PDE) make boundary condition (BC) enforcement challenging. Techniques to enforce BCs with PINNs have proliferated in the literature, but a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these techniques and a study of their efficacy on geometrically complex three-dimensional test problems are lacking. In this work, we i) systematically compare BC enforcement techniques for PINNs, ii) propose a general solution framework for arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and iii) verify the methodology on three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear test problems with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundaries. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying PDE, the geometry of the computational domain, and the nature of the BCs, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. This work represents a step in the direction of establishing PINNs as a mature numerical method, capable of competing head-to-head with incumbents such as the finite element method."}

Malawi passed the Local Government Act (1998) and Decentralization Policy (1998) to facilitate community participation in decision-making processes. Several studies have been conducted on decentralization and local governance on community participation. Little attention has been paid to examining the impact of the language used in planning processes on democracy and inclusivity envisaged in the law and policy. Using communicative action theory, the study examined challenges posed by language used in planning processes on inclusivity in the approval processes of urban plans. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, observations and document review and analyzed using thematic and discourse analysis. The findings show that while there is high participation at community planning levels, because planners communicate using local languages, participation is compromised in the service committees at city level where final planning decisions are made due to language barrier. Specifically, lack of sincerity, truthfulness, comprehensibility and therefore legitimacy are apparent. Planners are reluctant to simplify written language and translate planning jargon into local languages for councillors to understand. The study concludes that community participation in the urban planning process in Mzuzu fails to entrench democracy due to lack of inclusiveness owing to the language barrier at city level where final planning decisions are made.

This is shown to hold in the opposite manner to which it is routinely assumed, because in fact the fidelity a state has to an ideal GKP state is only upper bounded by the stabilizer expectation values.

However, constructing a reliable CKM demands substantial data and computation, and in dynamic environments, a pre-built CKM becomes outdated, degrading performance. Frequent retraining restores accuracy but incurs significant waste, creating a fundamental trade-off between CKM efficacy and update overhead. To address this, we introduce a Map Efficacy Function (MEF) capturing both gradual aging and abrupt environmental transitions, and formulate the update scheduling problem as fractional programming. We develop two Dinkelbach-based algorithms: Delta-P guarantees global optimality, while Delta-L achieves near-optimal performance with near-linear complexity. For unpredictable environments, we derive a threshold-based policy: immediate updates are optimal when the environmental degradation rate exceeds the resource consumption acceleration; otherwise, delay is preferable. For predictable environments, long-term strategies strategically relax these myopic rules to maximize global performance. Across this regime, the policy reveals that stronger entry loss and faster decay favor immediate updates, while weaker entry loss and slower decay favor delayed updates."}

In the bulk the butterfly velocity, the speed at which the out-of-time ordered correlator spreads, gains a directional dependence from the underlying lattice. Furthermore when there are chiral or helical edge modes present these cause a form of dynamical scarring. The information about an initial perturbation on the boundary of the system travels around the edge, carried by the edge modes, but is not scrambled over very long time scales. The direction and speed of the scars are given by the velocities of the linearly dispersing edge modes. We further show that these scars do not interact, passing through each other. We back up these results with analytical and numerical calculations on exemplary models."}

In addition, by studying the height-difference correlation function in real space, we have also been able to directly compute the dynamic correlation length and its associated dynamic critical exponent $z$. The full sets of scaling exponents are largely compatible with those of the Directed Percolation Depinning universality class for one and two dimensional interfaces. Furthermore, we have computed numerically the probability density function (PDF) of the front fluctuations in the growth regime, finding its asymptotic form in one and two dimensions. While the PDF features strongly non-Gaussian skewness and kurtosis values, it also differs from the PDF of the KPZ equation with time-dependent noise for physical substrate dimensions, both in the central part and at the tails of the distribution."}

While effective, it scales unfavorably with problem size. In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden. In practice, the resulting closed-loop system exhibits robust behavior and lower overall complexity. Notably, for a fixed query budget, QuantGraph attains a 2x increase in control-discretization precision while still benefiting from Grover-search's inherent quadratic speedup compared to classical methods."}

By combining a high-performing machine learning model with GeoShapley, the framework provides interpretable, tract-level insights into how roadway characteristics and socioeconomic factors contribute to crash risk. Specifically, results show that variables such as road density, intersection density, neighborhood compactness, and educational attainment exhibit complex nonlinear relationships with crashes. Extremely dense urban areas, such as Miami, show sharply elevated crash risk due to intensified pedestrian activities and roadway complexity. The GeoShapley approach also captures strong spatial heterogeneity in the influence of these factors. Major metropolitan areas including Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville display significantly higher intrinsic crash contributions, while rural tracts generally have lower baseline risk. Each factor exhibits pronounced spatial variation across the state. Based on these findings, the study proposes targeted, geography-sensitive policy recommendations, including traffic calming in compact neighborhoods, adaptive intersection design, speed management on high-volume corridors such as I-95 in Miami, and equity-focused safety interventions in disadvantaged rural areas of central and northern Florida. Moreover, this paper compares the results obtained from GeoShapley framework against other established methods (e.g., SHAP and MGWR), demonstrating its powerful ability to explain nonlinearity and spatial heterogeneity simultaneously."}

They attach to hypersimplices as annotations and participate in no identity, typing, or alpha/beta semantics. Projection over a boundary, B(H, b) = pi_b(H), is filtering only: it selects exactly those hypersimplices carrying b and preserves all axioms of the structural kernel. The backcloth remains immutable, and no new structure is created, removed, or inferred.\n  This paper formalises boundaries as a simple and conservative scoping mechanism. It clarifies their syntax, their interaction with projection, and their use in producing identity-preserving subsystem views that support modular modelling and overlapping perspectives. The account also makes explicit why conservative scoping matters: boundaries provide reproducible view extraction, stable subsystem isolation, and safe model exploration without altering the global structure.\n  Scoped operator application is defined as ordinary structural-kernel composition applied to projected views, ensuring that view-level reasoning remains local and does not modify the global hypernetwork. This establishes a disciplined separation between immutable structure and scoped analysis while retaining full compatibility with the structural kernel.\n  The paper includes a worked example demonstrating how boundaries yield coherent, identity-preserving subsystem views and how scoped reasoning supports refinement within these views. The result is a precise and minimal account of boundaries that complements - but does not extend - the structural kernel and completes the scoping mechanism required for practical multilevel modelling with HT."}

With global warming, evaluating how temperature influences pavement materials and resilience has become increasingly important. This study conducts a reliability analysis of pavement designed by traditional methods while incorporating seasonal temperature variation for Sao Paulo Congonhas International Airport CGH. After designing the pavement based on the airports traffic mix, a Monte Carlo Simulation was used to assess reliability under temperature changes. Results show that the cumulative damage factor from MCS is 79% lower than that obtained with the FAA method, indicating that aircraft cause less damage than predicted. The pavement could support 2.5 times more traffic at 95% reliability and 5.0 times more at 50% reliability. These findings suggest that, in Brazilian airports where fatigue governs design, FAARFIELD overestimates damage and increases construction costs, highlighting the need to calibrate design methods to local climatic conditions. Limitations include the deterministic temperature model and the exclusion of factors such as precipitation, thickness variability, and temperature dependent fatigue testing. Future work will aim to address these gaps and refine performance equations."}

Here, we show that a non-entangling operation can increase the Schmidt number of a quantum state only if it can generate entanglement with some non-zero probability. This is in stark contrast to the case where the parties of a quantum network are only able to control their joint state by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). There, being able to apply operations probabilistically (stochastic LOCC) does not increase the Schmidt number. Our findings show that certain non-entangling operations become entangling when selecting on specific measurement outcomes. This naturally leads us to the class of stochastically non-entangling maps, being those that cannot generate entanglement even probabilistically. Intrigued by this finding, we devise a Schmidt number for quantum channels that quantifies whether a channel can generate entanglement probabilistically. Moreover, we show that a channel is non-entangling if and only if its dual map is witness-preserving -- it takes entanglement witnesses to witnesses. Based on this finding, we derive Bell-like inequalities whose violation signals that a process generates entanglement."}

Typically, the prediction of the kinetics of these events relies on Arrhenius laws, with exponentially distributed waiting times, and no correlations between successive occurrences. However, this description breaks down in the presence of long-term memory, as has been observed in the contexts of geophysical time series or protein dynamics. So far, existing analytical approaches do not quantify the correlations between rare events due to long-term memory. Here, for non-Markovian Gaussian processes, we determine analytically the impact of long-term memory on the distribution of first and second passage times to a rarely reached threshold. This distribution is non-exponential, thus going beyond the Arrhenius paradigm. We obtain an explicit expression for the covariance between the first and second passage times, and we predict how the mean time to the next extreme event depends on the previous passage time, illustrating the phenomenon of clustering of extreme events. These analytical results, validated through extensive stochastic simulations, shed lights on the strong correlation between successive occurrences of extreme events due to long-term memory."}

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics."}

Through resampling within groups, the method approximates the null distribution of ranking-based test statistics without relying on distributional assumptions.

Despite this potential, it remains underexploited. In this work, we employ a proximal bundle framework to incorporate the function values and gradients at historical iterates and adapt the framework to the proximal decentralized gradient descent method, resulting in a Decentralized Proximal Bundle Method (DPBM). To broaden its applicability, we further extend DPBM to the asynchronous and stochastic setting. We theoretically analysed the convergence of the proposed methods. Notably, both the asynchronous DPBM and its stochastic variant can converge with fixed step-sizes that are independent of delays, which is superior to the delay-dependent step-sizes required by most existing asynchronous optimization methods, as it is easier to determine and often leads to faster convergence.

We develop a probabilistic framework based on volume sampling that yields interpolation-type error bounds quantifying the benefits of oversampling: when $r > k$ rows are selected for $k$ columns, the expected error factor transitions linearly from $(k+1)^2$ (no oversampling) to $(k+1)$ (full oversampling). Our analysis establishes that the expected squared error is bounded by this interpolation factor times the squared error of the best rank-$k$ approximation, directly connecting CUR approximation quality to the optimal low-rank approximation.

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics."}

However, a straightforward extension to stochastic problems requires an estimate of $\\nabla_{xt} f(x;t)$ and the computation of a Hessian inverse at each step--requirements that are difficult or costly in practice. To address these issues, we propose a prediction-correction algorithm that uses a regression-based prediction step: the prediction is formed as a linear combination of recent iterates, which can be computed efficiently without estimating $\\nabla_{xt}f(x;t)$ or computing Hessian inversions. We prove a tracking-error bound for the proposed method under standard smoothness and stochastic assumptions.

In this work, we propose that using geometric information -- when available -- to assist with setting up the AMG hierarchy is beneficial, especially for solving linear systems resulting from high-order finite element discretizations. High-order problems draw considerable interest to both the scientific and engineering communities, but lack efficient solvers, at least open-source codes, tailored for unstructured high-order discretizations targeting large-scale, real-world applications. For geometric multigrid, it is known that using p-coarsening before h-coarsening can provide better scalability, but setting up p-coarsening is non-trivial in AMG. We develop a geometrically informed algebraic multigrid (GIAMG) method, as well as an associated high-performance computing program, which is able to set up a grid hierarchy that includes p-coarsening at the top grids with minimal information of the geometry from the user. A major advantage of using p-coarsening with AMG -- beyond the benefits known in the context of geometric multigrid (GMG) -- is the increased sparsification of coarse grid operators. We extensively evaluate GIAMG by testing on the 3D Helmholtz and incompressible flow problems, and demonstrate mesh-independent convergence, and excellent parallel scalability. We also compare the performance of GIAMG with existing AMG packages, including Hypre and ML."}

To address this challenge, we introduce SoMe, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate social media agents equipped with various agent tools for accessing and analyzing social media data. SoMe comprises a diverse collection of 8 social media agent tasks, 9,164,284 posts, 6,591 user profiles, and 25,686 reports from various social media platforms and external websites, with 17,869 meticulously annotated task queries. Compared with the existing datasets and benchmarks for social media tasks, SoMe is the first to provide a versatile and realistic platform for LLM-based social media agents to handle diverse social media tasks. By extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we provide the first overview insight into the performance of mainstream agentic LLMs in realistic social media environments and identify several limitations. Our evaluation reveals that both the current closed-source and open-source LLMs cannot handle social media agent tasks satisfactorily.

We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard. In two dimensions, the low-measurement phase is an exotic critical phase with anisotropic spacetime scaling, analogous to a smectic liquid crystal."}

Although quantified potentials of various sufficiency measures exist, policy advisors and energy modellers criticise the lack of findability and comparability of the relevant data. Due to the high level of heterogeneity in units, reference points and calculation methods, the data cannot be used to summarise sufficiency potentials at a national level. Consequently, this paper aims to identify, structure, harmonise and synthesise existing data in order to determine the greatest saving potentials per sector and highlight data gaps. Based on a systematic literature review, we have created a curated open-source database containing over 300 quantified energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) saving potentials for Germany, which could be used as a blueprint for other such data collections. Most quantifications were available for the building sector, particularly for appliances. The highest total energy and GHG emission savings in Germany were identified in measures that reduce per capita living space, with saving potentials of -150 Terawatt-hours per year (TWh/a) and -118 Million Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalents per year (Mt CO2eq./a; this measure also includes lower heating temperatures). This synthesis can help modellers to better account for sufficiency potentials in scenarios, and help policymakers to understand the saving potentials of sufficiency. We encourage researchers to quantify more energy and GHG saving potentials in order to fill the identified gaps and to use the proposed synthesis structure."}

Here, we approach the problem using convex geometry, reducing the question to the characterization of the extreme points of the set of WPS. We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states.

Circuits whose gates do not create the resource but entangle neighboring qubits, give rise to a ballistic spreading of quantum resource initially confined to a region of the initial state. Our results give a unified picture of spatiotemporal resource dynamics in local circuits and a baseline for more structured quantum many-body systems."}

Dual control addresses this challenge by selecting actions that both regulate the system and actively gather informative data. This paper investigates the use of the Active Inference framework, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, for developing a dual model-predictive controller (MPC). To identify and quantify uncertainty, we introduce an online sparse semi-parametric Gaussian Process model that combines the flexibility of nonparametric with the efficiency of parametric learning for real-time updates. By applying the expected free energy functional to this adaptive probabilistic model, we derive an MPC objective that incorporates an information-theoretic term, which captures uncertainty arising from both the learned model and measurement noise. This formulation leads to a stochastic optimal control problem for dual controller design, which is solved using a novel dynamic-programming-based method. Simulation results on a vehicle use case demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enhances autonomous driving control performance across different settings and scenarios."}

For nearest-neighbor hopping on a square lattice, we find that the electronic spectrum is significantly renormalized, with bandwidth and quasi-particle residue strongly decreasing with increasing electron density. On the other hand, damping and particle-hole asymmetry increase, while a polaronic continuum forms in the hole sector, below the single-particle band. Fermi liquid phenomenology applies only at low densities, where the system remains paramagnetic. At higher densities, we find a bad metal with strong magnetic correlations, indicating that the ground state is the Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities and a stripe antiferromagnet at intermediate densities. Both in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic regimes, we observe a violation of Luttinger's theorem."}

Traditional approaches often fail to account for the intricate interactions within cyber-social systems and lack the flexibility to generalize across diverse domains, highlighting the need for more adaptive and versatile solutions. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose swarm intelligence algorithm for recommendation systems, designed to adapt seamlessly to varying applications. It was inspired by social psychology principles. The framework models user preferences and community influences within a dynamic hypergraph structure. It leverages centrality-based feature extraction and Node2Vec embeddings. Preference evolution is guided by message-passing mechanisms and hierarchical graph modeling, enabling real-time adaptation to changing behaviors. Experimental evaluations demonstrated the algorithm's superior performance in various recommendation tasks, including social networks and content discovery. Key metrics such as Hit Rate (HR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) consistently outperformed baseline methods across multiple datasets. The model's adaptability to dynamic environments allowed for contextually relevant and precise recommendations. The proposed algorithm represents an advancement in recommendation systems by bridging individual preferences and community influences.

Previous studies have extensively examined pairwise transmission and local reinforcement. However, the role of macro-level social influence -- where widespread adoption enhances further adoption -- remains understudied. Here, we focus on a contagion process that incorporates both pairwise interactions and macro-level reinforcement. We show that the contagion undergoes a shift from continuous to mixed-order transition as macro-level influence exceeds a reinforcement threshold. Simulations on various real-world networks indicate that network localization governs the contagion outcomes by determining the critical point and the reinforcement threshold. Building on this insight, we develop a structural metric linking network localization to contagion dynamics, revealing a key trade-off: networks that facilitate weak contagion tend to experience slower diffusion and lower adoption rates, while networks that suppress weak contagions enable faster and more widespread adoption. These findings challenge the conventional belief that stronger local connectivity uniformly promotes contagion."}

We show that this does not have to be the case: under restricted operational access, classical correlations can appear nonseparable when expressed in the formalism of quantum mechanics. If an observer is limited to a constrained set of measurements and transformations, certain classical phase-space distributions can mimic entanglement-like behaviours. Imposing positivity of the associated Hilbert space operator as a physicality requirement removes some of these representational artifacts, revealing a regime in which nonseparability is genuine but still reproducible by classical models. Only when the operational restrictions on the observer are lifted further--allowing operational tests of measurement incompatibility or other nonclassical signatures--does one obtain entanglement that can no longer be captured by any classical description. This operational hierarchy distinguishes classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement."}

Explicitly, both charge and dipole-moment conservation are strong symmetries, but under the dynamics they can be spontaneously broken to weak symmetries: this spontaneous symmetry breaking has an information-theoretic interpretation in terms of whether one can learn global charges from local measurements. We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard. In two dimensions, the low-measurement phase is an exotic critical phase with anisotropic spacetime scaling, analogous to a smectic liquid crystal."}

It allows for theoretically motivated estimation of return levels, including extrapolation beyond the range of observed data. A frequently overlooked challenge in applying this methodology comes from handling datasets containing missing values. In this case, one cannot be sure whether the true maximum has been recorded in each block, and simply ignoring the issue can lead to biased parameter estimators and, crucially, underestimated return levels. We propose an extension of the standard block maxima approach to overcome such missing data issues. This is achieved by explicitly accounting for the proportion of missing values in each block within the GEV model. Inference is carried out using likelihood-based techniques, and we propose an update to commonly used diagnostic plots to assess model fit. We assess the performance of our method via a simulation study, with results that are competitive with the \"ideal\" case of having no missing values. The practical use of our methodology is demonstrated on sea surge data from Brest, France, and air pollution data from Plymouth, U.K."}

To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality.

However, these methods rely on the homophily assumption-that connected nodes share similar class labels and should therefore be close in feature space-which fails to account for the varying homophily levels in real-world graphs. As a result, applying contrastive learning to low-homophily graphs may lead to indistinguishable node representations due to unreliable neighborhood information, making it challenging to identify trustworthy neighborhoods with varying homophily levels in graph clustering. To tackle this, we introduce a novel neighborhood Neutral Contrastive Graph Clustering method, NeuCGC, that extends traditional contrastive learning by incorporating neutral pairs-node pairs treated as weighted positive pairs, rather than strictly positive or negative. These neutral pairs are dynamically adjusted based on the graph's homophily level, enabling a more flexible and robust learning process. Leveraging neutral pairs in contrastive learning, our method incorporates two key components: (1) an adaptive contrastive neighborhood distribution alignment that adjusts based on the homophily level of the given attribute graph, ensuring effective alignment of neighborhood distributions, and (2) a contrastive neighborhood node feature consistency learning mechanism that leverages reliable neighborhood information from high-confidence graphs to learn robust node representations, mitigating the adverse effects of varying homophily levels and effectively exploiting highly trustworthy neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, outperforming other state-of-the-art graph clustering methods.

For example, roads in a transport network can be characterized not only by their connectivity but also by traffic flow or speed profiles. Understanding such systems therefore requires jointly analyzing the network structure and node attributes, a challenge addressed by attributed graph partitioning, which clusters nodes based on both connectivity and attributes. In this work, we adapt distance-based methods for this task, including Fréchet $k$-means and optimal transport-based approaches based on Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy. We investigate how GW methods, traditionally used for general-purpose tasks such as graph matching, can be specifically adapted for node partitioning, an area that has been relatively underexplored. In the context of node-attributed graphs, we introduce an adaptation of the Fused GW method, offering theoretical guarantees and the ability to handle heterogeneous attribute types. Additionally, we propose to incorporate distance-based embeddings to enhance performance. The proposed approaches are systematically evaluated using a dedicated simulation framework and illustrated on a real-world transportation dataset. Experiments investigate the influence of target choice, assess robustness to noise, and provide practical guidance for attributed graph clustering.

This makes it essential to design schedules that are robust and able to handle potential disruptions. Therefore, we investigate measures that give us information about the robustness of a schedule. Although many measures can be found in literature, there is no consensus on which measures are the best. We identify 14 robustness measures from the literature, as well as introduce 4 new ones. To find out which of these measures are best used for generating robust schedules, we perform an elaborate simulation study to investigate how well these robustness measures correlate with the stability of the objective function under disturbances (quality robustness) and with the stability of the schedule itself (solution robustness). We first consider the Stochastic Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (SPMSP) with precedence constraints, which is a very general setting that is relevant for many practical situations. We then perform a second simulation study by taking the best performing measures from the first experiment, and using them for the Train Unit Shunting Problem with Service Scheduling (TUSPwSS). After establishing the correlation with quality and solution robustness, we included the measures as objective in a local search algorithm. We make a comparison between the theoretical setting of the SPMSP and the TUSPwSS, and identify a set of robustness measures that can be applied in many different settings. We show that we can achieve up to 90% decreases in delays compared to using no robustness measures.

In this work, we employ a proximal bundle framework to incorporate the function values and gradients at historical iterates and adapt the framework to the proximal decentralized gradient descent method, resulting in a Decentralized Proximal Bundle Method (DPBM). To broaden its applicability, we further extend DPBM to the asynchronous and stochastic setting. We theoretically analysed the convergence of the proposed methods.

From a symmetry perspective, the MO includes an axial-dipole component analogous to that of the spin, making it essential to clarify how MO currents differ from spin currents. We here investigate the correspondence between MO conductivities and electronic multipoles, which provide a unified and powerful framework for symmetry analysis. We derive the multipole representation of the rank-five MO conductivity tensor and classify its symmetry-allowed components for all crystallographic point groups, in direct comparison with spin conductivity. We show that time-reversal-even electric-type multipoles give rise to the dissipationless MO current, whereas time-reversal-odd magnetic-type multipoles generate dissipative MO current under an applied electric field. Complementing this macroscopic analysis, the linear-response calculations for a microscopic tight-binding model demonstrate how MO conductivities are activated by symmetry lowering, exemplified by the symmetry reduction from Oh to Th. Our results elucidate the symmetry distinctions between MO currents and spin currents, and provide insights into their experimental identification."}

We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants.

Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories."}

Unlike traditional approaches, clustering in FH-SC is based on spectral clustering algorithms that utilize external covariates, rather than geographical or administrative criteria. A major advantage of the FH-SC model is its flexibility in integrating existing SAE approaches, with or without clustering random effects. To enable benchmarking, we leverage the theoretical framework of posterior projections for constrained Bayesian inference and derive closed form expressions for the new Rao-Blackwell (RB) estimators of the posterior mean under the FH-SC model. Additionally, we introduce a novel measure of uncertainty for the benchmarked estimator, the Conditional Posterior Mean Square Error (CPMSE), which is generalizable to other Bayesian SAE estimators. We conduct model-based and data-based simulation studies to evaluate the frequentist properties of the CPMSE. The proposed methodology is motivated by a real case study involving the estimation of the proportion of households with internet access in the municipalities of Colombia.

Such systems arise when advanced control and optimization tools are needed to overcome the limitations of smooth feedback methods and to satisfy demanding transient and steady-state requirements in high-performance applications. They also appear when controllers must operate on plants that inherently exhibit hybrid behaviors, as is common in cyber-physical and autonomous systems that rely on digital sensing, computation, and actuation. To study hybrid extremum-seeking dynamics through control-theoretic methods, we first review the key concepts that support the development of perturbation theory for hybrid inclusions, forming the basis for averaging and singular perturbation analyses. We then show how these ideas apply to the design and evaluation of hybrid extremum-seeking algorithms for static and dynamic plants. Several examples are presented, including set-valued and switching algorithms under different switching regimes such as arbitrarily fast switching, dwell-time and average dwell-time constraints, and average activation time conditions. We also discuss state-based switching extremum seeking for obstacle-avoidance problems and gradient-Newton switching schemes. Additional topics include momentum-based and reset-type extremum seeking, intermittent updates, slowly varying parameters, hybrid filters, and safety-aware schemes that incorporate constraints. Across all these settings, we illustrate how perturbation-based methods traditionally used for extremum-seeking control naturally extend to hybrid systems when mild regularity assumptions are satisfied, and solutions are modeled on hybrid time domains."}

We demonstrate how these methods can be used for data-driven subgroup identification in the analysis of clinical trials, focusing on two distinct tasks: identifying patient groups that are safe from manifesting adverse events and identifying patient groups with high treatment effect, while controlling for Type I error in both cases. A thorough simulation study is conducted to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each method, providing detailed insight into the sensitivity of the Type I error rate control to modelling assumptions."}

The investor trades a risk-free asset and several risky assets whose drifts and volatilities depend on an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type LRR factor. Preferences are described by EZ utility with risk aversion $R$, elasticity of intertemporal substitution $ψ$, and discount rate $δ$, so that the standard time-additive CRRA case appears as a limiting benchmark.\n  To handle the high-dimensional consumption--investment problem, I use a projected Pontryagin-guided deep policy optimization (P-PGDPO) scheme adapted to EZ preferences. The method starts from the continuous-time Hamiltonian implied by the Pontryagin maximum principle, represents the value and costate processes with neural networks, and updates the policy along the Hamiltonian gradient. Portfolio constraints and a lower bound on wealth are enforced by explicit projection operators rather than by adding ad hoc penalties.\n  Three main findings emerge from numerical experiments in a five-asset LRR economy: \\textbf{(1)} the P-PGDPO algorithm achieves stable convergence across multiple random seeds, validating its reliability for solving high-dimensional EZ problems; \\textbf{(2)} wealth floors materially reduce hedging demand by limiting the investor's ability to exploit intertemporal risk-return tradeoffs; and \\textbf{(3)} the learned hedging portfolios concentrate exposure in assets with high correlation to the LRR factor, confirming that EZ agents actively hedge long-run uncertainty rather than merely following myopic rules. Because EZ preferences nest time-additive CRRA in the limit $ψ\\to 1/R$, I use CRRA as an explicit diagnostic benchmark and, when needed, a warm start to stabilize training in high dimensions."}

For geometric parameters, pMOR by matrix interpolation is a well-suited approach because it does not require an affine representation of the parametric dependency, which is often not available for geometric parameters. However, the method requires that the underlying FE mesh has the same number of degrees of freedom and the same topology for all parameter configurations. This requirement can be difficult or even impossible to achieve for large parameter ranges or when automatic meshing is used. In this work, we propose a novel framework for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes. The key idea is to understand the sampled reduced bases as continuous displacement fields that can be represented in different discretizations. By using mesh morphing and basis interpolation, the sampled reduced bases described in varying meshes can all be represented in terms of one reference mesh. This not only allows for performing pMOR by matrix interpolation, but also enables comparing the subspaces that the reduced bases span, which is important to detect strong changes that could lead to inconsistencies in the reduced operators. For mesh morphing, two strategies, namely morphing by spring analogy with elastic hardening and radial basis function morphing, were implemented and tested. Numerical experiments on a beam-shaped plate and a plate with a hole for one- and two-dimensional parameter spaces show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy for both morphing methods and performs significantly better than two existing approaches for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes."}

This crossover is observed in the isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local field, exhibiting the Many-Body Localization (MBL) transition. Inspired by the analysis of stability in dynamical systems, this crossover is presented as a flow pattern in the parameter space, with the Poisson statistics being the fixed point of the system, which represents the MBL phase. We also analyze an isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local exchange coupling and a zero magnetic field. In this case, the system never achieves the MBL phase because of the spin rotation symmetry. This case is more sensitive to finite-size effects than the previous one, and thus the flow pattern resembles a two-dimensional random walk close to its fixed point. We propose a system of linearized stochastic differential equations to estimate this fixed point. We study the continuous-state Markov process that governs the probability of finding the system close to this fixed point as the disorder strength increases. In addition, we discuss the conditions under which the stationary probability distribution is given by a bivariate normal distribution."}

To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality.

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics."}

Then building on this relation, we define residual battery capacity for general quantum states and establish coherent/incoherent components of subsystem battery capacity. Furthermore, we introduce the protocol to guide the selection of appropriate incoherent unitary operations for enhancing subsystem battery capacity in specific scenarios, along with a sufficient condition for achieving subsystem capacity gain through unitary operation. Numerical examples validate the feasibility of the incoherent operation protocol.

The staggered polynomial spaces are designed so that the discrete curl and divergence operators preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. The magnetic field is then recovered in a space--time post-processing step via a discrete version of Faraday's law. The global space--time formulation yields a large but highly structured linear system, which we approximate in low-rank TT-format directly from the operator and data, without assuming that the forcing is separable in space and time.

Deterministic methods can produce accurate solutions without any statistical noise, yet often at a price of expensive computational costs originating from the intrinsic high dimensionality of the model. With this work, we present the first systematic investigation of projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) following the reduced basis method (RBM) framework to simulate the parametric steady-state RTE with isotropic scattering and one energy group. Four ROMs are designed, with each defining a nested family of reduced surrogate solvers of different resolution/fidelity. They are based on either a Galerkin or least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection and utilize either an $L_1$ or residual-based importance/error indicator. Two of the proposed ROMs are certified in the setting when the absorption cross section is positively bounded below uniformly. One technical focus and contribution lie in the proposed implementation strategies under the affine assumption of the parameter dependence of the model. These well-crafted broadly applicable strategies not only ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the offline training stage and the online prediction of reduced surrogate solvers, they also take into account the conditioning of the reduced systems as well as the stagnation-free residual evaluation for numerical robustness. Computational complexities are derived for both the offline training and online prediction stages of the proposed model order reduction strategies, and they are demonstrated numerically along with the accuracy and robustness of the reduced surrogate solvers. Numerically we observe four to six orders of magnitude speedup of our ROMs compared to full order models for some 2D2v examples."}

On the basis of these monogamy inequalities, we render two kinds of hierarchical indicators that exhibit evident advantages in the capacity of witnessing entanglement. Moreover, we show an analytical relation between $G_q$-concurrence and concurrence in $2\\otimes d$ systems. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the monogamy property of squared $G_q$-concurrence is superior to that of squared concurrence in $2\\otimes d_2\\otimes d_3\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes d_N$ systems.

In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \\le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above.

One popular time integration scheme is the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), in which the time integration is constrained to a low-rank manifold. However, until recently, DLRA has typically used orthogonal projectors to project the original dynamical system into a reduced space, which is only well-suited for linear systems.

To integrate bosonic codes into larger architectures, we develop decoding methods that exploit analog syndrome information, enabling quasi-single-shot decoding in concatenated systems. On the discrete-variable side, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a highly parallelizable decoder for quantum LDPC codes, and propose quantum radial codes, a new family of single-shot LDPC codes with low overhead and strong circuit-level performance. Finally, we present fault complexes, a homological framework for analyzing faults in dynamic quantum error correction protocols. Extending the role of homology in static CSS codes, fault complexes provide a general language for the design and analysis of fault-tolerant schemes."}

Despite many theoretical models, decoherence remains a severe challenge and practical platforms are still rare. Here we propose the QB based on the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO), using the signal field as the energy-storage unit. We carefully separate the ergotropy into coherent and incoherent components and find that the coherent part decays roughly half as slowly as the incoherent part. More importantly, the coherent ergotropy and the average charging power reach their respective maxima at essentially the same moment, i.e., $γ_s t \\approx 10$. This coincidence defines the optimal instant to switch off the pump. Finally, coupling the QB to a two-level system (TLS) as the load, we demonstrate an efficient discharge process of the QB. Our work establishes a realistic and immediately-implementable QB architecture on a mature optical platform."}

One limitation of the algorithm is that it requires knowledge of the number of solutions to obtain an optimal success probability, due to the oscillatory dynamics between the initial and solutions states (the ``soufflé problem''). While various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each has their drawbacks in terms of inefficiency or sensitivity to control errors. Here, we modify Grover's algorithm to eliminate the oscillatory dynamics, such that the search proceeds as an exponential decay into the solution states. The basic idea is to convert the solution states into a reservoir by using ancilla qubits such that the initial state is nonreflectively absorbed. Trotterizing the continuous algorithm yields a quantum circuit that gives equivalent performance, which has the same quadratic quantum speedup as the original algorithm."}

Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories."}

This shortest gate time, expected to lie on the nanosecond scale, is inferred from job execution times measured in seconds by employing gate-time amplification.

The effect of decoherence varies depending on the phase-space features of quantum states, which are theoretically characterized by the Wigner phase space and appear at different scales. We explore the compass state and its photon-added and photon-subtracted variants, each of which exhibits phase-space features with dimensions beyond the Planck scale, making them suitable for quantum sensing applications. We investigate the interaction of these states with a heat reservoir by employing a range of well-established theoretical techniques, revealing a clear tradeoff between the degree of fineness in the smallest features, such as the sub-Planck structure, and the extent of decoherence. Specifically, increasing the parameters enhances sub-Planck precision in phase space, concomitantly amplifying the fragility of these compass states to undesired decoherence. Our general illustration, validated through these compass states, also applies to any pure quantum state interacting with the considered heat reservoir, exhibiting enhanced sustainability of features at larger phase-space extensions."}

Moreover, this hybrid setup is experimentally realizable and ensures that power enhancement is not achieved at significant cost to energy efficiency, while allowing for greater tunability and stable operation in the presence of noise."}

Here, we implement in 173Yb(trensal) qudit the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a core component of numerous quantum algorithms, storing quantum information in the phases of coherences. QFT provides an ideal benchmark for coherence manipulation and an unprecedented challenge for molecular spin qudits. We address this challenge by embedding a full-refocusing protocol for spin qudits in our algorithm, mitigating inhomogeneous broadening and enabling a high-fidelity recovery of the state. Complete state tomography demostrates the performance of the algorithm, while simulations provide insight into the physical mechanisms behind inhomogeneous broadening. This work shows the feasibility of quantum logic on molecular spin qudits and highlights their potential."}

Among them, generalized coherent states (GCS), which naturally arise from the evolution of a coherent state with a nonlinear medium, exhibit useful quantum features such as Wigner negativity and metrological advantages [Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013165 (2023)]. Because these states remain coherent to all orders, their nonclassical character cannot be revealed through standard intensity-intensity correlation measurements. Here, we demonstrate that the intensity-field correlation function alone provides a simple and experimentally accessible witness of nonclassicality. For GCSs, any deviation of this normalized correlation from unity signals nonclassical behavior. We derive analytical results for Kerr-generated states and extend the analysis to statistical mixtures of GCSs. The proposed approach enables real-time, low-complexity detection of quantum signatures in non-Gaussian states, offering a practical tool for experiments across a broad range of nonlinear regimes."}

Thus, all entangled states are broadcast nonlocal in quantum theory. In addition, we show that all (also mixed) multipartite states can be broadcast-self-tested, according to a natural operational definition."}

To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie."}

In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_α$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different from the standard graph states arising from stabiliser formalism. Our approach is also different from the approach used by Braunstein et al. This class of states depend on a tunable mixing parameter $α\\in (0,1]$. We first establish the conditions under which the associated operator $ρ_α^{A_G}$ is positive semidefinite and hence represents a valid quantum state. We then derive a positive partial transposition (PPT) condition for $A_α$-graph states in terms of graph parameters. This PPT condition involves only the Frobenius norm of the adjacency matrix of the graph, the degrees of the vertices and the total number of vertices. For simple graphs, we obtain the range of the parameter $α$ for which the $A_α$-graph states represent a class of entangled states. We then develop a graph-theoretic formulation of a moments-based entanglement detection criterion, focusing on the recently proposed $p_3$-PPT criterion, which relies on the second and third moments of the partial transposition. Since the estimation of these moments is experimentally accessible via randomised measurements, swap operations, and machine-learning-based protocols, our approach provides a physically relevant framework for detecting entanglement in structured quantum states derived from graphs. This work bridges graph theory and moments-based entanglement detection, offering a new perspective on the role of combinatorial structures in quantum correlations."}

A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements."}

In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states."}

A meron cluster algorithm recently formulated for gauge fields represented as spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ quantum links coupled to a single flavour of staggered fermions samples only two of the exponentially many Gauss law (GL) sectors at low temperatures, making it possible to simulate either of those two GL sectors at zero temperature in polynomial time. In this article, we analytically identify GL sectors which can be simulated without encountering the fermion sign problem in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods, we further explore the nature of phases in the GL sectors dominating at zero temperature. The vacuum states lie in sectors which satisfy a staggered Gauss law, in contrast to the zero GL sector familiar in particle physics. Moreover, we prove that while the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, the usual zero-charge GL sector (often considered the physical sector) does. We outline the role of the magnetic energy in causing transitions between GL sectors. We expect our results to be valid for truncated Kogut-Susskind gauge theories, beyond quantum link models."}

Here we propose a two-parameter surmise expression for such distribution to describe the crossover between the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) and Poisson statistics. This crossover is observed in the isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local field, exhibiting the Many-Body Localization (MBL) transition. Inspired by the analysis of stability in dynamical systems, this crossover is presented as a flow pattern in the parameter space, with the Poisson statistics being the fixed point of the system, which represents the MBL phase. We also analyze an isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local exchange coupling and a zero magnetic field. In this case, the system never achieves the MBL phase because of the spin rotation symmetry. This case is more sensitive to finite-size effects than the previous one, and thus the flow pattern resembles a two-dimensional random walk close to its fixed point. We propose a system of linearized stochastic differential equations to estimate this fixed point. We study the continuous-state Markov process that governs the probability of finding the system close to this fixed point as the disorder strength increases. In addition, we discuss the conditions under which the stationary probability distribution is given by a bivariate normal distribution."}

To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality. These findings establish the existence of anomalous dynamical scaling arising from the interplay between topology and driven dynamics, challenging standard paradigms of quantum critical dynamics."}

We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments."}
