In this work, we provide a characterization of the complete, exhaustive family of distinct algorithms using predetermined step-sizes, represented as lower triangular H-matrices, which attain the same optimal convergence rate. The characterization is based on polynomials in the entries of the H-matrix that we call H-invariants, whose values stay constant over all optimal H-matrices, together with H-certificates, of which nonnegativity precisely specifies the region of optimality within the common level set of H-invariants. The H-invariance theory we present offers a novel view of optimal acceleration in first-order optimization as a mathematical study of carefully selected invariants, certificates, and structures induced by them."}

The problem, posed over a finite time horizon, is reformulated deterministically by expressing the cost functional in terms of a collection of second-moment matrices of the system state. A projection operator is introduced to restrict the analysis to the subspace of visited states, namely those with positive probability of being reached within the time horizon. The solution of the resulting deterministic problem is obtained from a reduced-order system of coupled matrix Riccati differential equations involving only the visited states, which define a quadratic value function satisfying a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type equation. The structure of this equation is formally justified in the matrix setting via the Riesz-Frechet representation theorem, establishing a rigorous foundation for the deterministic reformulation and resolving an open aspect in previous literature. Several numerical examples, including cases with non-communicating states, validate the theoretical results and illustrate the practical relevance of the proposed generalization."}

An advantage of DH systems is that they are always stable due to the structure of their coefficient matrices, and, under further weak conditions, even asymptotically stable. In this paper, we discuss the computation of the stability radii for a given asymptotically stable DH system; i.e., the smallest structured perturbation that puts a DH system on the boundary of the region of asymptotic stability, so that it has purely imaginary eigenvalues. We obtain explicit computable formulas for various structured stability radii. For this, the problem of computing stability radii is reformulated in terms of minimizing the Rayleigh quotient of a Hermitian matrix or the sum of two generalized Rayleigh quotients of Hermitian semidefinite matrices. This reformulation results in the problem of minimizing the largest eigenvalue of an eigenvector-dependent Hermitian matrix or minimizing the smallest eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix which depends on the eigenvector. It is also demonstrated (via numerical experiments) that, under structure-preserving perturbations, the asymptotic stability of a DH system is much more robust than under general perturbations, since the distance to instability is typically much larger when structure-preserving perturbations are considered. Finally, similar results are obtained for optimally robust representations of stable systems."}

The control problem is formulated as a two-player zero-sum differential game, where the controller is a minimizing player and the adversary a maximizing player. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a saddle-point solution and safe predefined-time stability using a barrier Lyapunov function that satisfies a differential inequality and the steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation. To address the analytical intractability of solving the HJI equation, we introduce a physics-informed learning algorithm that robustly learns the Nash safely predefined-time stabilizing control strategy.

We investigate this phenomenon in the gapped spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a staggered field, where spinons bind into domain-wall ``mesons'' deep in the antiferromagnetic phase. We present evidence that this non-integrable model exhibits both Hilbert space fractionalization and quantum scar formation as controlled by the anisotropy parameter $Δ$. Exact diagonalization across symmetry-resolved sectors reveals a crossover from Gaussian-orthogonal (chaotic) level statistics at weak anisotropy $Δ\\sim 1$ to non-ergodic behavior deep in the antiferromagnetic regime $Δ\\gg 1$ through scrutinizing the adjacent gap ratios, accompanied by a striking banding of eigenstates by domain-wall number in correlation and entanglement measures. The Page-like entanglement dome characteristic of chaotic spectra gives way to suppressed, band-resolved entanglement consistent with emergent quasi-conservation of domain walls. To investigate further the formation mechanism of mesonic scar states, we carry out meson spectroscopy near the two-spinon threshold and compare with the analytic ladder predicted by Rutkevich [Phys. Rev. B 106, 134405 (2022)]. We test the theory through continuum-relative bindings, an offset-removed Airy scaling collapse, and explicit two-meson thresholds that determine the number of stable meson levels. The low-lying spectrum shows close quantitative agreement, while deviations at higher energies are consistent with finite-size and subleading corrections. These results establish a unified account of confinement-induced nonergodicity and provide a template for quantitative meson spectroscopy in quantum spin chains."}

These loss functions take a target value and its realization as arguments and are often used to measure accuracy. The equivalence is proved for a large class of loss functions, the weighted exponentiated functions, when the weights are decomposable as a particular product form. An upshot is that when losses are averaged for a large number of units, differences in ratios and, hence, ranks, are negligible, when the average (or summed) difference between the target values and their realizations is around zero. This implies the almost sure asymptotic convergence of numerical and distributive accuracy when using these loss functions."}

Understanding how sentiment dynamics and emotional contagion unfold among followers is vital for influencers and marketers, as these processes shape engagement, brand perception, and purchasing behavior. While sentiment analysis tools effectively track sentiment fluctuations, dynamical models explaining their evolution remain limited, often neglecting network structures and interactions both among blogs and between their topic-focused follower groups. In this study, we tracked influential tech-focused Weibo bloggers over six months, quantifying follower sentiment from text-mined feedback. By treating each blogger's audience as a single \"macro-agent\", we find that sentiment trajectories follow the principle of iterative averaging -- a foundational mechanism in many dynamical models of opinion formation, a theoretical framework at the intersection of social network analysis and dynamical systems theory. The sentiment evolution aligns closely with opinion-dynamics models, particularly modified versions of the classical French-DeGroot model that incorporate delayed perception and distinguish between expressed and private opinions. The inferred influence structures reveal interdependencies among blogs that may arise from homophily, whereby emotionally similar users subscribe to the same blogs and collectively shape the shared sentiment expressed within these communities."}

Bimanual psychomotor proficiency is fundamental to neurosurgical procedures, yet it remains difficult for trainees to acquire and for educators to objectively evaluate performance. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of a neurosurgical simulation platform that integrates an anatomically realistic brain model with surgical instrument tracking to support training and objective assessment of bimanual tasks in the context of subpial corticectomy. Methods. We developed and evaluated a neurosurgical simulation platform based on an ex-vivo calf brain model and a multi-camera tracking system capable of simultaneously capturing the motion of surgical instruments in both hands, including collection of real-time instrument trajectories and synchronized video recordings. These enabled extraction of motion-based, time-based, and bimanual coordination metrics. We conducted a case series involving 47 participants across four training levels: medical students, junior residents, senior residents, and neurosurgeons. Results. The tracking system successfully captured instrument motion during 81% of the periods when instruments were actively used throughout the simulation procedure. Several extracted metrics were able to significantly differentiate between levels of surgical expertise. In particular, instrument usage duration and custom-defined bimanual coordination metrics such as instrument tip separation distance and simultaneous usage time, show potential as features to identify participant expertise levels with different instruments. Conclusions. We demonstrated the feasibility of tracking surgical instruments during complex bimanual tasks in an ex-vivo brain simulation platform. The metrics developed provide a foundation for objective performance assessment and highlight the potential of motion analysis to improve neurosurgical training and evaluation."}

For local spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), we show that as a symmetric equilibrium approaches instability, trajectories exhibit pronounced critical slowing down accompanied by a rise in Shannon entropy.

We further characterize the entropy discontinuity associated with global symmetry breaking (GSSB) through an ergodic decomposition viewpoint.

Specifically, PAS-Net augments the trunk input in the physics informed Deep Operator Network (PI-DeepONet) with a prescribed (or learnable) locally rescaled coordinate transformation centered at reference points. This addition introduces a multiscale feature embedding that acts as an architecture-independent preconditioner which improves the representation of localized, stiff, and multiscale dynamics. From an optimization perspective, the adaptive-scale embedding in PAS-Net modifies the geometry of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the neural network by increasing its smallest eigenvalue, which in turn improves spectral conditioning and accelerates gradient-based convergence. We further show that this adaptive-scale mechanism explicitly accelerates neural network training in approximating functions with steep transitions and strong asymptotic behavior, and we provide a rigorous proof of this function-approximation result within the finite-dimensional NTK matrix framework. We test the proposed PAS-Net on three different problems: (i) the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, (ii) a nonlinear diffusion-reaction system with sharp spatial gradients, and (iii) a two-dimensional eikonal equation.

In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom.

The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples."}

The Tapestry's inscription only refers to this as a star, though we can see from its depiction, shown with a hairy tail, that it is a comet, now known to us as Halleys Comet P1/Halley. Behind the exciting story of the Bayeux Tapestry, however, goes a rich mythological world of intrigue, deceit, the succession of kings, and earlier sightings of the same comet. In historical accounts of many cultures, comets are generally considered portents of change rather than disaster. Here we consider the significance of the Tapestry's comet in the context of the so-called English succession crisis of 1066 with reference to other contemporary accounts of comets. We conclude that although the tapestry's illustration is suggestive and unmistakably Halleys Comet, it is not a priority for its creators to give a precise account of its arrival in the sky, but rather connect it, likely for political reasons, albeit retrospectively, to the sequential events of Edwards death and Harolds coronation. In that, the tapestry's anonymous artists provide a unique telling of its arrival."}

Without prior knowledge of the system model parameters, an adaptive and direct learning rule for the cost parameter is proposed using online off-policy system data, which only needs to satisfy the mild persistently exciting condition in the general data-driven paradigm. The adaptive and online IRL algorithm is achieved by designing full Nesterov-Todd (NT)-step primal-dual interior-point iterations. Despite solving a nonlinear and time-varying semi-definite program (SDP), the influence of system noise is rigorously analyzed, and the proposed online algorithm is shown to achieve a sublinear convergence. The proposed method is further generalized to nonlinear IRL based on differential dynamic programming. The gradient of the loss function is directly obtained via a backward pass, which eliminates the need to repeatedly solve forward RL problems as in conventional bi-level IRL frameworks. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by numerical examples."}

However, when optimized using gradient descent, VQAs often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, commonly known as the barren plateau. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with a neural network to update the parameters of variational quantum circuits. We refer to this method as NPID, which aims to mitigate the barren plateau. The proposed algorithm is tested on randomly generated quantum input states and random quantum circuits with parametric noise to evaluate its universality, and additional simulations are conducted under different noise rates to examine its robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated based on its convergence speed toward the target cost value. Simulation results show that NPID achieves a convergence efficiency 2-9 times higher than NEQP and QV, with performance fluctuations averaging only 4.45% across different noise levels. These results highlight the potential of integrating classical control theory into quantum optimization, providing a new perspective for improving the trainability and stability of variational quantum algorithms."}

To explain this observation, we develop a diagrammatic framework for the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev model. We demonstrate that bare phonons contribute no RCD, but coupling to the chiral spin excitation continuum under an applied magnetic field renormalizes the phonon propagator, mixing real polarization eigenvectors into complex superpositions with finite angular momentum. This interaction-induced modification generates a nonzero RCD accompanied by characteristic Fano line shapes in the Raman response, reflecting interference between discrete phonons and the continuum. The resulting signal grows with magnetic field strength, consistent with experiment, and directly tracks the field-induced chirality of the spin sector. More broadly, our results establish RCD as a powerful probe of interaction-induced chiral phonons in correlated quantum materials."}

This work presents a top-down approach to screen and broadly understand the benefits of flexibility based on system uptime, power capacity (PC), energy capacity (EC), and round- trip efficiency (RTE). Depending on the region and season, cost savings from flexibility range from 0 to over 100% and emissions savings are generally bounded between 5-40%. We also find the magnitude and cost of emissions abatement from flexibility is highly variable and, in some cases, up to four orders of magnitude less than regional renewable energy credits or common investing or policy benchmarks like the social cost of carbon. While the value of flexibility is highly dynamic, estimating savings as a function of load characteristics and incentives can inform heuristic design of new systems, siting strategies, comparison of flexibility to other decarbonization options, and new avenues for incentivizing flexibility."}

This study presents a novel variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) designed to address the task scheduling problem formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. The proposed method, referred to as Quantum Time Interval Scheduler (QTIS), integrates an ancilla-assisted quantum circuit to dynamically detect and penalize overlapping tasks, enhancing the enforcement of scheduling constraints. Two complementary implementations are explored for overlap detection: a quantum approach based on RY rotations and CCNOT gates, and a classical alternative relying on preprocessed interval comparisons. QTIS decomposes the problem Hamiltonian, Hp, into two components, each parameterized by a distinct angle. The first component encodes the objective function, while the second captures penalty terms associated with overlapping intervals, which are controlled by the auxiliary circuit. Subsequently, three minimization strategies are evaluated: standard QAOA, T-QAOA, and HT-QAOA, showing that employing separate parameters for the different components of the problem Hamiltonian leads to lower energy values and improved solution quality. Results confirm the efficiency of QTIS in scheduling tasks with fixed temporal windows while minimizing conflicts, demonstrating its potential to advance hybrid quantum-classical optimization in complex scheduling environments."}

In resource-limited settings, high rates of loss to follow-up (LTFU) often result in underestimation of mortality when only observed deaths are considered. Resampling, which tracks a subset of LTFU patients to ascertain their outcomes, mitigates bias and improves survival estimates. However, common estimators for survival in resampling designs, such as weighted Kaplan-Meier (KM), fail to leverage covariate information collected during repeated clinic visits, even though this information is highly predictive of survival. We propose a Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator (TMLE) for survival in resampling designs, which addresses these limitations by leveraging baseline and longitudinal covariates to achieve greater efficiency. Our TMLE is a plug-in estimator and is robust to misspecification of the initial model for the conditional hazard of death, guaranteeing consistency of our estimator due to known resampling probabilities. We present: (1) a fully efficient TMLE for data from resampling studies with fixed follow-up time for all participants and (2) an inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) TMLE that accounts for varied follow-up times by stratifying on patients with sufficient follow-up to evaluate survival. This IPCW-TMLE can be made highly efficient through nonparametric or targeted estimation of the follow-up censoring mechanism. In simulations, our TMLE reduced variance by up to 55% compared with the commonly used weighted KM estimator while preserving nominal confidence interval coverage. These findings demonstrate the potential of our TMLE to improve survival estimation in resampling designs, offering a robust and resource-efficient framework for HIV research.

While traditional blanket modeling of liquid metal flows during normal steady operating conditions commonly employs the inductionless approximation of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, transient scenarios, when the plasma-confining magnetic field varies on millisecond time scales, require a full-induction MHD approach that dynamically evolves the magnetic field via the time-dependent induction equation. This paper presents the formulation, implementation, and initial verification of a full-induction MHD solver integrated within the open-source Vertex-CFD framework, which aims to achieve tight multiphysics coupling, a flexible software design enabling easy extension and addition of physics models, and performance portability across computing platforms. The solver utilizes finite element spatial discretization, implicit Runge--Kutta time integration, and an inexact Newton method to solve the resulting discrete nonlinear system, leveraging Trilinos packages for efficient computation. Verification against selected benchmark problems demonstrates accuracy and robustness of the solver. Furthermore, when the solver is applied to an idealized blanket model in 2.5D and full 3D, results obtained with Vertex-CFD are in good agreement with recently published quasi-2D simulations. These findings establish a computational foundation for future simulations of transient MHD phenomena in liquid metal blankets with Vertex-CFD, and open avenues for future extensions and performance optimizations."}

Using thirteen representative two-dimensional simulation systems (two stealthy hyperuniform systems with distinct constraint parameters and ; hyperuniform Gaussian pair statistics system; six hyperuniform targeted systems with distinct alpha=0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 3.0, random sequential addition system; Poisson points distribution system; Lennard-Jones fluid system and Yukawa fluid system) and two real biological systems (avian photoreceptor patterns and looped leaf vein networks) We find that moderate random spatial truncation (i.e., randomly extracting a smaller subwindow from the original full-field configuration) does not change qualitatively the hyperuniformity classification of the systems. Specifically, disordered hyperuniform systems retain their respective hyperuniformity classes despite a modest reduction in measured hyperuniformity exponent alpha (i.e., reduction in small-k suppression). Moreover, spatial truncation commonly induces configuration-dependent fluctuations of small-k values of S(k). We show that modest reciprocal-space radial pooling (controlled by a binning parameter m) effectively smooths such spurious wiggles without changing the hyperuniformity class. Practical guidelines for choosing m, cross-checking spectral fits with the local number variance scaling, and increasing effective sampling are provided. These results provide concrete, low-cost and effective methodology for robust spectral detection of hyperuniformity in finite and truncated datasets which abound in experimental systems."}

We prove existence of optimal sets (at least when $D$ is large enough), regularity and express the optimality conditions. Moreover, we prove that the optimal sets have exactly two connected components and their boundary does not contain any arc of circle."}

Based on recent advancements in reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT), a variant of DFT that is believed to be better suited for strongly correlated systems, we construct a mathematical framework generalizing all ground state functional theories, which in particular applies to fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems. We show that within the special class of such functional theories where the space of external potentials forms the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group, the $N$-representability problem is readily solved by applying techniques from the study of momentum maps in symplectic geometry, an approach complementary to Klyachko's famous solution to the quantum marginal problem. The ``boundary force'', a diverging repulsive force from the boundary of the functional's domain observed in previous works but only qualitatively understood in isolated systems, is studied quantitatively and extensively in our work. Specifically, we present a formula capturing the exact behavior of the functional close to the boundary. In the case where the Lie algebra is abelian, a completely rigorous proof of the boundary force formula based on Levy-Lieb constrained search is given. Our formula is a first step towards developing more accurate functional approximations, with the potential of improving current RDMFT approximate functionals such as the Piris natural orbital functionals (NOFs). All key concepts and ideas of our work are demonstrated in translation invariant bosonic lattice systems."}

The first two occur at the same temperature, which has led to a consensus that the MIT is driven by lattice distortions. We show here that the primary driving force for the MIT is magnetic; however because of the unusual d7 configuration of Ni, additional flexibility in spin configurations are also needed which symmetry-lowing structural deformations make possible. The latter enable Ni to disproportionate into two kinds: a high-spin and a low-spin configuration, which allow the system to reduce its unfavorable orbital moment and also open a gap."}

Starting from the canonical contact forms and total derivative on the finite jet bundle $J^m(\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R})$, we construct the Cartan distribution and the associated Ehresmann connection, whose non-integrability and torsion encode the geometric source of curvature corrections in statistical estimation. In the statistical jet bundle $E=\\mathbb{R}\\times L^2(μ)$, we point out that the condition for an estimator error to lie in the span of derivatives of $s_θ$ up to order $m$ is equivalent to the square root map satisfying a linear differential equation of order~$m$. The corresponding submanifold of $J^m(E)$ defined by this equation represents the locus of $m$-th order efficient models, and the prolonged section must form an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between algebraic projection conditions underlying CRB and Bhattacharyya-type bounds and geometric integrability conditions for the statistical section in the jet bundle hierarchy. The resulting framework links variance bounds, curvature, and estimator efficiency through the geometry of Cartan distributions, offering a new differential equation and connection-theoretic interpretation of higher-order information inequalities."}

Despite their popularity, performing inference on the non-linear fit remains largely unaddressed. This paper focuses on classification trees and makes two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel tree-fitting method that replaces the greedy splitting of the predictor space in standard tree algorithms with a probabilistic approach. Each split in our approach is selected according to sampling probabilities defined by an exponential mechanism, with a temperature parameter controlling its deviation from the deterministic choice given data. Second, while our approach can fit a tree that, with high probability, approximates the fit produced by standard tree algorithms at high temperatures, it is not merely predictive- unlike standard algorithms, it enables valid inference by taking into account the highly adaptive tree structure. Our method produces pivots directly from the sampling probabilities in the exponential mechanism. In theory, our pivots allow asymptotically valid inference on the parameters in the predictive fit, and in practice, our method delivers powerful inference without sacrificing predictive accuracy, in contrast to data splitting methods."}

Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($α= 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods."}

Using a general framework characterized by probabilistic rules for disconnection and reconnection based on node similarity, we systematically explore how homophilic and heterophilic interactions influence network topology. A mean-field approximation for the stationary density of active links-those connecting nodes in different states-is developed to determine the conditions under which fragmentation occurs. Analytical results closely agree with numerical simulations. To distinguish community formation from fragmentation, we introduce order parameters that integrate modularity and connectivity. This enables the characterization of three distinct network phases on the rewiring parameter space: i) random connectivity, ii) community structure, and iii) fragmentation. Community structure emerges only under moderate homophily, while extreme homophily or heterophily lead to fragmentation or random networks, respectively. These findings demonstrate that adaptive rewiring alone, independent of node dynamics, can drive complex structural self-organization, with implications for social, technological, and ecological systems where node attributes are intrinsically stable."}

To address the first challenge, we propose the Greedy Mini-Extragradient (Mini-EG) method, which updates only the coordinate associated with the dominant component of the mapping at each extragradient step. This design capitalizes on componentwise Lipschitz constants that are far easier to estimate than the classical global Lipschitz constant. To further lower computational cost, we introduce a Random Mini-EG variant that replaces full mapping evaluations by sampling only a single coordinate per extragradient step. Although this resolves the second challenge from a theoretical standpoint, its practical efficiency remains limited. To bridge this gap, we develop the Watchdog-Max strategy, motivated by the slow decay of dominant component magnitudes. Instead of evaluating the full mapping, Watchdog-Max identifies and tracks only two coordinates at each extragradient step, dramatically reducing per-iteration cost while retaining strong practical performance. We establish convergence guarantees and rate analyses for all proposed methods. In particular, Greedy Mini-EG achieves enhanced convergence rates that surpass the classical guarantees of the vanilla EG method in several standard application settings. Numerical experiments on regularized decentralized logistic regression and compressed sensing show speedups exceeding $13\\times$ compared with the classical EG method on both synthetic and real datasets."}

We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state, making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast, we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation, we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a stronger QME."}

Recently, heterostructures combining 2D magnets and nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored. In these, electron and hole wavefunctions are localized in 2D magnets but delocalized in TMDs. When combined, a proximity induced magnetic inter layer exciton can emerge, with energy differing by 20 to 30 meV from intra layer excitons and being two orders of magnitude darker, making it hard to detect and functionalize. Using a high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach, we show that functionality can be significantly enhanced in a transition metal molecule TMD interface. The molecular exciton exhibits charge transfer character and is extended, unlike the localized Frenkel excitation in 2D magnets. Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states."}

By expressing the Hill estimator of the target EVI as a ratio of means, we apply approximate control variates to both numerator and denominator, with jointly optimized coefficients that guarantee variance reduction without introducing bias. We show theoretically and through simulations that the asymptotic relative variance reduction of the transferred Hill estimator is proportional to the tail dependence between the target and source variables and independent of their EVI values. Thus, substantial variance reduction can be achieved even without similarity in tail heaviness of the target and source distributions. The proposed approach can be extended to other EVI estimators expressed with ratio of means, as demonstrated on the moment estimator. The practical value of the proposed method is illustrated on multi-fidelity water surge and ice accretion datasets."}

In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems."}

The SolarEV City Concept, linking rooftop photovoltaics with electric vehicles as mobile storage offers a technically robust pathway for deep CO2 reduction, potentially meeting 60-95 percent of municipal electricity demand when deployed synergistically. Despite rapid global growth of PVs and EVs, integration through bidirectional Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid systems has lagged, revealing a persistent SolarEV paradox. This review examines that paradox through a socio-technical framework across four dimensions, technology, economics, policy, and society. Cross-national comparison shows that while technical feasibility is well established, large-scale implementation is limited by fragmented charging-protocol standards, immature and often non-profitable V2G business models, regulatory misalignments between energy and transport sectors, and social-equity barriers that restrict participation mainly to high-income homeowners. Emerging national archetypes from Japans resilience-driven model to Europes regulation-first trajectory highlight strong path dependence in current integration strategies. The analysis concludes that advancing SolarEV Cities requires a shift from parallel PV-EV promotion toward coordinated policy frameworks, interoperable digital infrastructure, and inclusive market designs that distribute economic and resilience benefits more equitably. Achieving this integrated energy transition will require strategic collaboration among researchers, governments, industries, and communities to build adaptive, resilient, and socially just urban energy systems."}

In this work we discuss unisolvence and conditioning of the associated matrices, in an asymptotic linear algebra perspective, i.e., when the matrix-size $d$ tends to infinity. While the unisolvence is a rather sparse topic, the conditioning in the unisolvent setting has a uniform behavior: as for the case of standard Vandermonde matrix-sequences with real nodes, the conditioning is inherently exponential as a function of $d$ when the monomial basis is chosen. In contrast, for an appropriate selection of supports, the Chebyshev basis of second kind has a bounded conditioning. A linear behavior is also observed in the Frobenius norm."}

While commonly reported by practitioners, time-varying VE estimates obtained using Cox regression are vul- nerable to hidden biases. To address these limitations, we describe how to leverage vaccine-irrelevant infections to identify hazard-based, time-varying VE in the pres- ence of unmeasured confounding and selection bias. We articulate assumptions under which our approach identifies a causal effect of an intervention deferring vaccination and interaction with the community in which infections circulate. We develop sieve and efficient influence curve-based estimators and discuss imposing monotone shape constraints and estimating VE against multiple variants. As a case study, we examine the observational booster phase of the Coronavirus Vaccine Efficacy (COVE) trial of the Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine which used symptom-triggered multi- plex PCR testing to identify acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) caused by SARS-CoV-2 and 20 off-target pathogens previously identified as compelling negative controls for COVID-19. Accounting for vaccine-irrelevant ARIs supported that the mRNA-1273 booster was more effective and durable against Omicron COVID-19 than suggested by Cox regression.

Among them, the activity-driven model is a widely used, analytically tractable benchmark. Yet many temporal networks, such as those of physical proximity, are also embedded in space, and spatial constraints are known to affect dynamics unfolding on the networks strongly. Despite this, there is a lack of similar simple and solvable models for spatiotemporal contact structures. Here, we introduce a spatial activity-driven model in which short-range contacts are more frequent. This model is analytically tractable and captures the joint effects of space and time. We show analytically and numerically that the model reproduces several characteristic features of social and contact networks, including strong and weak ties, clustering, and triangles having weights above the median. These traits can be attributed to space acting as a form of memory. Simulations of spreading dynamics on top of the model networks further illustrate the role of space, highlighting how localisation slows down spreading. Furthermore, the framework is well-suited for modelling social distancing in a principled way as an intervention measure aimed at reducing long-range links. We find that, unlike for non-spatial networks, even a small spatially targeted reduction in the total number of contacts can be very effective. More broadly, by offering a tractable framework, the model enables systematic exploration of dynamical processes on spatiotemporal networks."}

In particular, a measure of quality for those PSSs is required to obtain complexity bounds for direct search.\n  In this paper, we derive complexity guarantees for a class of Riemannian direct-search techniques, and study two ways of generating positive spanning sets in tangent spaces. We pay particular attention the unit hypersphere case, for which we establish that generating directions directly within the tangent space leads to better complexity properties than projecting PSSs from the ambient space onto the tangent space.

We relate the minimum time to the Quantum Fisher Information ($F_Q$) for a system of $N$ quantum spins on a $d$-dimensional lattice with $1/r^α$ interactions with $r$ being the distance between two interacting spins. We focus on states with $F_Q \\sim N^{1+γ}$ where $γ\\in (0,1]$, i.e., scaling from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. For short-range interactions ($α> 2d+1$), we prove the minimum time $t$ scales as $t \\gtrsim L^γ$, where $L \\sim N^{1/d}$. For long-range interactions, we find a hierarchy of possible speedups: $t \\gtrsim L^{γ(α-2d)}$ for $2d < α< 2d+1$, $t \\gtrsim \\log L$ for $(2-γ)d < α< 2d$, and $t$ may even vanish algebraically in $1/L$ for $α< (2-γ)d$. These bounds extend to the minimum circuit depth required for state preparation, assuming two-qubit gate speeds scale as $1/r^α$. We further show that these bounds are saturable, up to sub-polynomial corrections, for all $α$ at the Heisenberg limit ($γ=1$) and for $α> (2-γ)d$ when $γ<1$.

Here, we employ Raman spectroscopy to probe magnetic excitations and the evolution of spin correlations in $β$-VOSO$_4$. Spinon signatures are found along the chain direction, evidenced by a broad, gapless scattering continuum at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the spinon spectral weight aligns considerably with numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations. By comparing the experimental spinon spectral weight with calculated results and evaluating the associated quantum Fisher information (QFI) therefrom, we observe a steep increase in QFI upon cooling, indicating rapidly growing correlation lengths.

These parameters allow the model to attribute non-zero shifts to outliers while leaving clean observations unaffected. ROAMS then enables automatic outlier detection, through the addition of a penalty term on the number of flagged outlying timepoints in the objective function, and simultaneous estimation of model parameters. We apply the method to robustly estimate SSMs on both simulated data and real-world animal location-tracking data, demonstrating its ability to produce more reliable parameter estimates than classical methods and other benchmark methods. In addition to improved robustness, ROAMS offers practical diagnostic tools, including BIC curves for selecting tuning parameters and visualising outlier structure.

Branching processes operate over an infinite population such that they never circle back and interact with previously exposed parts of the system. This infinite, treelike, structure makes it tricky to account for complex contagion mechanisms such as group effects, peer pressure, or social reinforcement where multiple exposures interact in synergistic ways. Here we present a self-consistent solution that accounts for local group structure and global cycles where the process can feedback on itself. This allows us to distinguish multiple exposures that stem from a single transmission chain, from those occurring at the intersection of different transmission chains. We find that only the latter mechanism can give rise to a discontinuous phase transition in the size of global cascades, which is a defining feature of complex contagions. Group effects alone, without long cycles, produce standard continuous phase transitions."}

In this work, we introduce an exact and computationally efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries derived from fermionic double excitation and deexcitation rotations. These unitaries are expressed as ordered products of exponentials of Pauli operators. Our method exploits the fact that the elementary operators in these generators form small Lie algebras. By working in the adjoint representation of these algebras, we reformulate the factorization problem as a low-dimensional nonlinear optimization over matrix exponentials. This approach enables precise numerical reparametrization of the unitaries without relying on symbolic manipulations. The proposed factorization provides a practical strategy for constructing symmetry-conserving quantum circuits within variational algorithms.

Some properties of the fractional quadrature rule have been proved, and the absolute error bound in the proposed fractional quadrature rule has been derived. The behavior of roots of the orthogonal Müntz polynomial has also been observed for its application as nodes in the fractional quadrature rule. To illustrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed fractional quadrature rule, we focus on fractional differential equations that incorporate the left Caputo fractional derivative. In this context, Müntz-Legendre scaling functions are utilized to approximate the Caputo derivative of functions involved in these equations.

Understanding how sentiment dynamics and emotional contagion unfold among followers is vital for influencers and marketers, as these processes shape engagement, brand perception, and purchasing behavior. While sentiment analysis tools effectively track sentiment fluctuations, dynamical models explaining their evolution remain limited, often neglecting network structures and interactions both among blogs and between their topic-focused follower groups. In this study, we tracked influential tech-focused Weibo bloggers over six months, quantifying follower sentiment from text-mined feedback. By treating each blogger's audience as a single \"macro-agent\", we find that sentiment trajectories follow the principle of iterative averaging -- a foundational mechanism in many dynamical models of opinion formation, a theoretical framework at the intersection of social network analysis and dynamical systems theory.

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a classical simulation outperforming Gaussian boson sampling experiments of one hundred modes on established benchmark tests using a single CPU or GPU. Being embarrassingly parallelizable, a small number of CPUs or GPUs allows us to match previous sampling rates that required more than one hundred GPUs.

Our DFT+DMFT calculations reveal non-Fermi-liquid behavior and coherence loss near the Fermi level at low pressures, driven by strong electron correlations within the Ni-e_g orbital manifold, which is analogous to the low-energy electronic properties observed in La3Ni2O7. However, multi-orbital spin susceptibility analysis demonstrates an exceptionally suppressed critical Stoner parameter U_c (about 0.4~0.7 eV), indicating robust magnetic order that dominates the ground state and precludes superconductivity in the pristine system. Below U_c, superconducting instabilities exhibit a pressure-driven symmetry transition: the d_(x2-y2)-wave pairing prevails at ambient and low pressure, while the s+g-wave symmetry occurs above 75 GPa. This transition is attributed to pressure-induced self-doping effect. The high-angular-momentum g-wave component incurs significant energetic penalties, rendering high-Tc superconductivity unlikely. We conclude that the absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 arises from its robust intrinsic magnetism and the unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure, suggesting that alternative routes-such as chemical doping or epitaxial strain-are necessary to suppress magnetism and unlock superconducting states."}

These weights are chosen to properly balance the competing losses according to some meta-goal. For example, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), these weights are often adaptively chosen to improve the network's generalization error. A popular choice of adaptive weights is based on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of the PINN, which describes the evolution of the network in predictor space during training. The convergence of such an adaptive weighting algorithm is not clear a priori. Moreover, these NTK-based weights would be updated frequently during training, further increasing the computational burden of the learning process. In this paper, we prove that under appropriate conditions, gradient descent enhanced with adaptive NTK-based weights is convergent in a suitable sense. We then address the problem of computational efficiency by developing a randomized algorithm inspired by a predictor-corrector approach and matrix sketching, which produces unbiased estimates of the NTK up to an arbitrarily small discretization error. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and to show the efficacy of our randomized algorithm. Code Availability: https://github.com/maxhirsch/Efficient-NTK"}

In this work we propose a globalized CQM in the QRM by introducing an auxiliary nonlinear term which is realizable and can extend the critical point to a continuous critical regime. As a consequence, a high measurement precision is globally available over the entire coupling regime from the original critical point of the QRM down to the weak-coupling limit, as demonstrated by the globally accessible diverging quantum Fisher information in dynamics. We illustrate a measurement scheme by quadrature dynamics, with globally criticality-enhanced inverted variance as well as the scaling relation with respect to finite frequencies. In particular, we find that the globally high measurement precisions still survive in the presence of decoherence. Our proposal paves a way to break the local limitation of QPT of the QRM in CQM and enables a broader application, with implications of applicability in realistic situation."}

This poses major challenges for interpretability and reliable feature selection. Tasks such as identifying motif interactions in genomics exemplify these difficulties, as only a small subset of biologically relevant features (e.g., motifs) are typically active, and their effects are often non-linear and context-dependent. While statistical approaches often result in more interpretable models, deep learning models have proven effective in modeling complex interactions and prediction accuracy, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability. We introduce BaGGLS, a flexible and interpretable probabilistic binary regression model designed for high-dimensional biological inference involving feature interactions. BaGGLS incorporates a Bayesian group global-local shrinkage prior, aligned with the group structure introduced by interaction terms. This prior encourages sparsity while retaining interpretability, helping to isolate meaningful signals and suppress noise. To enable scalable inference, we employ a partially factorized variational approximation that captures posterior skewness and supports efficient learning even in large feature spaces. In extensive simulations, we can show that BaGGLS outperforms the other methods with regard to interaction detection and is many times faster than MCMC sampling under the horseshoe prior. We also demonstrate the usefulness of BaGGLS in the context of interaction discovery from motif scanner outputs and noisy attribution scores from deep learning models. This shows that BaGGLS is a promising approach for uncovering biologically relevant interaction patterns, with potential applicability across a range of high-dimensional tasks in computational biology."}

This addition introduces a multiscale feature embedding that acts as an architecture-independent preconditioner which improves the representation of localized, stiff, and multiscale dynamics. From an optimization perspective, the adaptive-scale embedding in PAS-Net modifies the geometry of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the neural network by increasing its smallest eigenvalue, which in turn improves spectral conditioning and accelerates gradient-based convergence. We further show that this adaptive-scale mechanism explicitly accelerates neural network training in approximating functions with steep transitions and strong asymptotic behavior, and we provide a rigorous proof of this function-approximation result within the finite-dimensional NTK matrix framework.

Close to phase transitions, they respond collectively to external perturbations, which can be harnessed for technological applications in the domain of quantum metrology and sensing. Owing to the controllable complexity and straightforward interpretability of Rydberg atoms, we can observe and tune the emergent collective nonlinearity. Here, we investigate the application of an interacting Rydberg vapour for the purpose of time series prediction. The vapour is driven by a laser field whose Rabi frequency is modulated in order to input the time series. We find that close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where collective effects are amplified, the capability of the system to learn the input becomes enhanced. This is reflected in an increase of the accuracy with which future values of the time series can be predicted. Using the Lorenz time series and temperature data as examples, our work demonstrates how emergent phenomena enhance the capability of noisy many-body quantum systems for data processing and forecasting."}

Each segment is designed to enforce specific desirable properties of the estimator such as rapidity, desired condition number of the information matrix, accuracy, numerical stability, etc. The forgetting profile is divided in three segments, where the speed of estimation is ensured by the first segment, which employs rapid exponential forgetting of recent data.The second segment features a decline in the profile and marks the transition to the third segment, characterized by slow exponential forgetting to reduce the condition number of the information matrix using more distant data. Condition number reduction mitigates error propagation, thereby enhancing accuracy and stability. This approach facilitates the incorporation of a priori information regarding signal characteristics (i.e., the expected behavior of the signal) into the estimator. Recursive and computationally efficient algorithm with low rank updates based on new matrix inversion lemma for moving window associated with this regularization approach is developed. New algorithms significantly improve the approximation accuracy of low resolution daily temperature measurements obtained at the Stockholm Old Astronomical Observatory, thereby enhancing the reliability of temperature predictions."}

This construction avoids direct estimation of conditional mean embeddings and reduces the problem to scalar-valued regressions, resulting in robust finite-sample size control. Theoretically, we derive the limiting distribution of the SGCM statistic, establish the validity of a wild bootstrap for inference, and obtain uniform asymptotic size control under doubly robust conditions. As an additional contribution, we show that exponential kernels induced by continuous semimetrics of negative type are characteristic on general Polish spaces -- with extensions to finite tensor products -- thereby providing a foundation for applying our test and other kernel methods to complex objects such as distribution-valued data and curves on metric spaces. Extensive simulations indicate that the SGCM-based CI test attains near-nominal size and exhibits power competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art alternatives across a range of challenging scenarios."}

We use a phase-detection OPA seeded by a tapped probe and pump light before a squeezer OPA. This configuration breaks the conventional trade-off between generating a phase-locking signal with high-signal-to-noise ratio and suppressing degradation of squeezing level caused by optical tapping.

Code available on GitHub", "summary": "In modern multiple hypothesis testing, the availability of covariate information alongside the primary test statistics has motivated the development of more powerful and adaptive inference methods. However, most existing approaches rely on p-values that are precomputed under the assumption that their null distributions are independent of the covariates. In this paper, we propose a framework that derives covariate-adaptive p-values from the assumption of a symmetric null distribution of the primary variable given the covariates, without imposing any parametric assumptions. Building on these data-driven p-values, we employ a neural network model to learn a covariate-adaptive rejection threshold via the mirror estimation principle, optimizing the number of discoveries while maintaining valid false discovery rate control. Furthermore, our estimation of the conditional null distribution enables the computation of p-values directly from the raw data. The proposed method provides a principled way to derive covariate-adjusted p-values from raw data and allows seamless integration with previously established p-value based procedures. Simulation studies show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of power. We further illustrate its applicability through two real data analyses: age-specific blood pressure data and U.S. air pollution data."}

Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium.

Here, we study minimal work protocols for representative two-level systems coupled to a harmonic-oscillator bath using a numerically exact method. Inspired by known optimal solutions for Brownian oscillators, we introduce an impulse ansatz that incorporates possible boundary impulses and test it across a wide range of bath parameters. We find that impulse-like features remain nearly optimal in the quantum, non-Markovian regime, at short times.

We propose a control variates based transfer learning approach in a semi-supervised framework, where a small set of coupled target and source observations is combined with abundant unpaired source data. By expressing the Hill estimator of the target EVI as a ratio of means, we apply approximate control variates to both numerator and denominator, with jointly optimized coefficients that guarantee variance reduction without introducing bias. We show theoretically and through simulations that the asymptotic relative variance reduction of the transferred Hill estimator is proportional to the tail dependence between the target and source variables and independent of their EVI values. Thus, substantial variance reduction can be achieved even without similarity in tail heaviness of the target and source distributions. The proposed approach can be extended to other EVI estimators expressed with ratio of means, as demonstrated on the moment estimator.

Our nonmodular backstepping feedbacks are implementable with either unidirectional or bidirectional velocity actuation. Thanks to constructing families of strict CLFs for the unicycle, we introduce a general design framework and families of feedback laws for the unicycle, which are inverse optimal with respect to meaningful costs. These inverse optimal feedback laws are endowed with robustness to actuator uncertainty and arbitrarily low input saturation due to the unicycle's driftlessness. Besides ensuring robustness to unknown input coefficients, we also develop adaptive laws for these unknown coefficients, enabling the achievement of good transient performance with lower initial control effort. Additionally, we develop controllers that achieve stabilization within a user-specified time horizon using two systematic methods: time-dilated prescribed-time design with smooth-in-time convergence to zero of both the states and the inputs and homogeneity-based fixed-time control that provides an explicit bound on the settling time. Finally, with a nonovershooting design we guarantee strictly forward motion without curb violation.

The variational parameters in our ansatz are derived from a global action principle, where Euler-Lagrange equations govern their optimal dynamics. Unlike conventional wavefunction-based variational methods, our approach specifically targets the time evolution operation and this allows a single set of optimized parameters to be applied to any initial state for a fixed Hamiltonian avoiding costly optimization procedures. Our method outperforms the standard Trotter-Suzuki formulas, typically achieving higher accuracy than higher-order Suzuki schemes. This translates directly to quantum computing applications, where it enables the design of quantum circuits with fewer gates which reduces noise and improves precision. Although we focus on quantum dynamics, the method is broadly applicable to problems involving general time-evolution operators. Applied to various model Hamiltonians, our approach reduces errors by factors of 2 to 5 compared to Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, demonstrating its promise for accurate quantum simulation with improved efficiency. In certain cases, the variational ansatz achieves higher accuracy than more complex higher-order Suzuki formulas while reducing the gate count by nearly half within a single circuit layer. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the variational parameters up to cubic order in time, valid for generic Hamiltonians. These approximations enable long-time quantum simulations with improved accuracy over equivalent Suzuki decompositions, providing ready-to-use evolution formulas that match Suzuki's gate complexity while delivering better performance."}

To this aim, we construct a quantum circuit that prepares an initial state comprising an equal superposition of all feasible solutions, and define a custom mixer that preserves both the one-hot encoding constraint for vertex coloring and the cardinality constraint on the number of antennas. This scheme can be extended to a broader range of applications characterized by similar constraints. We first benchmark the performance of this quantum algorithm against a basic version of QAA, demonstrating superior performance in terms of feasibility and success probability.

Our approach hinges on a refined swap sensitivity analysis: stochastic fluctuation is controlled via a variance-adaptive Doob martingale and Freedman's inequality, while design bias is bounded using Stein's method of exchangeable pairs. The analysis suggests how covariate geometry governs concentration and bias through leverages and cross-leverages, shedding light on when and how regression adjustment improves on the difference-in-means baseline."}

In the linear-quadratic case, a common assumption is that the rotated cost is positive definite. The positive semi-definite case has received surprisingly little attention, and the connection to the standard dissipativity assumption has not been investigated. In this paper, we fill this gap by connecting existing results in economic model predictive control with the stability results for the semi-definite case, the properties of the constrained generalized discrete algebraic Riccati equation, and of two optimal control problems.

However, it is necessarily difficult to directly assess the performance of such high-quality logical qubits using standard Monte Carlo sampling because logical failure events become very rare. Building on existing approaches to this problem, we develop three complementary techniques to characterize the rare-event regime for general quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes under circuit noise. (I) We propose a well-motivated, low-parameter ansatz for the failure spectrum (the fraction of fault sets of each size that fail) that empirically fits all the QEC systems we studied and predicts logical error rates at all physical error rates. (II) We find min-weight logical operators of syndrome measurement circuits and exactly compute the number of min-weight failing configurations. (III) We generalize the splitting method to qLDPC codes using multi-seeded Metropolis sampling to improve convergence for systems with many inequivalent logical operators.

Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems."}

FPQE employs a convolutional encoder-decoder to learn compact multi-channel representations capable of reconstructing the original data with high fidelity, which are then mapped into quantum states through amplitude encoding. Experimental results show that FPQE performs comparably to conventional methods on simple datasets such as MNIST, while achieving clear improvements on more complex ones, outperforming PCA and pruning based encodings by up to 10.2\\% accuracy on Cifar-10. The performance gain grows with data complexity, demonstrating FPQE's ability to preserve high-level structural information across diverse visual domains.

It is demonstrated that QSentry can effectively detect anomalous distributions induced by backdoor samples with extensive experiments. It achieves a 75.8% F1 score even under a 1% poisoning rate, and further improves to 85.7% and 93.2% as the poisoning rate increases to 5% and 10%, respectively. The integration of silhouette coefficients and relative cluster size enable QSentry to precisely isolate backdoor samples, yielding estimates that closely match actual poisoning ratios.

To improve reliability in such settings, we study an adaptive diversity strategy for discrete-variable QuMIMO systems based on universal asymmetric cloning at the transmitter and probabilistic purification at the receiver. An input qubit is encoded into M approximate clones, transmitted over an N x N multi-mode quantum channel, and recovered through a purification map optimized using available channel state information (CSI). For the given cloning asymmetry parameters, we derive an eigenvalue-based expression for the decoder-optimal end-to-end fidelity in the form of a generalized Rayleigh quotient, which enables efficient tuning of the cloner without iterative optimization. As a design choice, we employ semidefinite program (SDP) to construct the purification map for only a targeted success probability p. This numerical framework is used to study fixed-noise, dimension-scaling noise, and stochastic depolarization regimes. A cloning asymmetry index is introduced to quantify the distribution of quantum information across the multiple subchannels across these operating conditions.

This study presents a novel variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) designed to address the task scheduling problem formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. The proposed method, referred to as Quantum Time Interval Scheduler (QTIS), integrates an ancilla-assisted quantum circuit to dynamically detect and penalize overlapping tasks, enhancing the enforcement of scheduling constraints. Two complementary implementations are explored for overlap detection: a quantum approach based on RY rotations and CCNOT gates, and a classical alternative relying on preprocessed interval comparisons. QTIS decomposes the problem Hamiltonian, Hp, into two components, each parameterized by a distinct angle. The first component encodes the objective function, while the second captures penalty terms associated with overlapping intervals, which are controlled by the auxiliary circuit. Subsequently, three minimization strategies are evaluated: standard QAOA, T-QAOA, and HT-QAOA, showing that employing separate parameters for the different components of the problem Hamiltonian leads to lower energy values and improved solution quality. Results confirm the efficiency of QTIS in scheduling tasks with fixed temporal windows while minimizing conflicts, demonstrating its potential to advance hybrid quantum-classical optimization in complex scheduling environments."}

One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme."}

We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom.
