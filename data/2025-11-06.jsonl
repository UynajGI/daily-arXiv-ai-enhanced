This study\nuses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social\nscience knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making\ndomains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the\nmeasurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories\nas key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703\ndocuments (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and\npolicy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas\nin each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare\ndifferences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion\npatterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas\ndiffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding\nregression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find\nthat the distances between research and policy are typically larger than\nbetween research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles\nacross domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making\nin news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe\nsemantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented. Our\nresults characterize the cross-domain diffusion patterns and dynamics of social\nscience knowledge at the idea level, and we discuss the implications for\nmeasuring knowledge diffusion beyond citations."}

In\nthis research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer\ntailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP\nencodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances\nand whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path\nattention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or\ncontexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local\nlightcone context.

The evolution of the internal variables during\ntraining is handled by solving the evolution equations using an implicit\nexponential time integrator. In addition, a trainable gate layer combined with\nlp regularization automatically identifies the required number of internal\nvariables during training. The PANN is calibrated with synthetic and\nexperimental data, showing excellent agreement for a wide range of deformation\nrates and different load paths. We also show that the proposed model achieves\nexcellent interpolation as well as plausible and accurate extrapolation\nbehaviors. In addition, we demonstrate consistency of the PANN with linear\nviscoelasticity by linearization of the full model."}

The insurer's surplus follows the diffusion\napproximation of the Cram\\'er-Lundberg model, and the insurer can purchase\nproportional reinsurance. Model ambiguity is characterised by a class of\nequivalent probability measures, and the insurer, being ambiguity-averse, aims\nto maximise utility under the worst-case scenario. By solving the associated\ncoupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE), we derive\nclosed-form solutions for the optimal strategies and the value function. Our\nanalysis reveals how ambiguity aversion, risk aversion, and the elasticity of\nintertemporal substitution (EIS) influence the optimal policies.

This\nyields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose\nboundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic\nconditions on the network data.\n  We prove that under the absence of negative recession\ndirections--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux\ncaps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several\nsufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are\nidentified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis\nconnects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's\nbound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern\nnetwork-based diffusion modeling.\n  Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large\nstadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with\nrelatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network\nemanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component\nsystem."}

The\nfirst example, involving a unit cell with a square plate and circular core,\nvalidates the approach for a single well-conditioned projection region. The\nsecond example, using a beam-like structure with vibration attenuation bands,\ndemonstrates the true advantage of the multi-region approach, where predictions\nfrom traditional Lagrange interpolation deviated significantly with increasing\nperturbations, while the proposed method maintained high accuracy across\ndifferent perturbation levels."}

Existing high-order methods often exhibit a gap: the function\nvalue residual decreases fast, while the gradient norm converges much slower.\nTo close this gap, we introduce AR that systematically transforms fast function\nvalue residual convergence rate into fast (matching) gradient norm convergence\nrate.\n  Specifically, for composite convex problems, for computing an approximate\nsolution such that the norm of its (sub)gradient does not exceed $\\varepsilon,$\nthe proposed AR methods match the best corresponding convergence rate for the\nfunction value residual. We further extend the framework to uniformly convex\nsettings, establishing linear, superlinear and sublinear convergence of the\ngradient norm under different lower curvature conditions. Moreover, we design\nparameter-free algorithms that require no input of problem parameters, e.g.,\nLipschitz constant of the $p$-th order gradient, the initial optimality gap and\nthe uniform convexity parameter, and allows inexact solution for each\nhigh-order step.

Our approach uses\na ROM, leverages tools from robust control, and integrates them into an MPC\nframework to achieve computational tractability with robust constraint\nsatisfaction. Our key contribution is a method to obtain guaranteed bounds on\nthe predicted outputs of the full-order system by predicting a (scalar)\nerror-bounding system alongside the ROM. This bound is then used to formulate a\nrobust ROM-based MPC that guarantees constraint satisfaction and robust\nperformance. Our method is developed step-by-step by (i) analysing the error,\n(ii) bounding the peak-to-peak gain, an (iii) using filtered signals.

While MLE performs well in canonical GLMs, it\ncan become computationally inefficient near the true parameter value. In more\ngeneral settings with non-canonical or fully general link functions, the\nresulting optimization landscape is often non-convex, non-smooth, and\nnumerically unstable. To address these challenges, we investigate an\nalternative estimator based on solving the variational inequality (VI)\nformulation of the GLM likelihood equations, originally proposed by Juditsky\nand Nemirovski as an alternative for solving nonlinear least-squares problems.\nUnlike their focus on algorithmic convergence in monotone settings, we analyze\nthe VI approach from a statistical perspective, comparing it systematically\nwith the MLE. We also extend the theory of VI estimators to a broader class of\nlink functions, including non-monotone cases satisfying a strong Minty\ncondition, and show that it admits weaker smoothness requirements than MLE,\nenabling faster, more stable, and less locally trapped optimization.\nTheoretically, we establish both non-asymptotic estimation error bounds and\nasymptotic normality for the VI estimator, and further provide convergence\nguarantees for fixed-point and stochastic approximation algorithms. Numerical\nexperiments show that the VI framework preserves the statistical efficiency of\nMLE while substantially extending its applicability to more challenging GLM\nsettings."}

A player's reward depends\nnot only on their own state and action but also on the distribution of states\nand actions across the population, capturing effects such as congestion in\ntraffic networks. In Part I, we introduced an evolutionary model and a new\nsolution concept - the mixed stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which\ncoincides with the rest points of the mean field evolutionary model under\nmeaningful families of revision protocols. In this second part, we investigate\nthe evolutionary stability of MSNE. We derive conditions on both the structure\nof the MSNE and the game's payoff map that ensure local and global stability\nunder evolutionary dynamics.
